    "headline": "Joe Biden Biden 2024 Polls Forecast Opinion Potential Reelection Campaign",
    "summary": "While President Biden has yet to declare with certainty if he will run for reelection in 2024, polling groups are gauging the opinion of voters to understand how recent political developments have impacted perceptions of the President. While the next battle for the White House remains over two years away, practically an eternity in politics, current polling data offers insight on voters\u2019 approval of the current Administration, shaping the field for the direction it will take after November\u2019s midterm elections.A recent poll from Emerson College revealed that President Biden has seen a bump in approval in past months, with a large portion coming from women voters. An analysis fromNewsweek (Center bias)attributed this boost to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturnRoe v. Wadethis past summer. The Biden Administration has since taken a strong pro-choice stance, and during a speech on Friday, Biden promised to codify abortion rights into law if Democrats gained two additional Senate seats in the midterm elections.Among Democratic Party leadership,CNN (Left bias)reported a \u201cwarming\u201d up to the idea of a Biden reelection campaign. The Emerson College poll also reported Biden holding a slight lead over Donald Trump in what theNew York Post (Lean Right Bias)labeleda \u201cvirtual dead heat.\u201d While Biden currently leads in a potential rematch against Former President Donald Trump, another poll analyzed by TheWashington Examiner (Lean Right bias)found 56% of polled Democrat voters still prefer a candidate other than Biden in the 2024 election.",
