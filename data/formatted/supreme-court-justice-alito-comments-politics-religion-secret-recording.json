    "summary": "At the Supreme Court Historical Society\u2019s annual dinner last week,\u00a0liberal activist Lauren Windsorsecretly recordedChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.Key Quote: When Windsor said she didn\u2019t believe conservatives could \u201cnegotiate with the left in the way that needs to happen for polarization to end,\" Alito said, \u201cI think you\u2019re probably right. One side or the other is going to win. I mean, there can be a way of working \u2014 a way of living together peacefully, but it\u2019s difficult, you know, because there are differences on fundamental things that really can\u2019t be compromised. They really can\u2019t be compromised. So it\u2019s not like you are going to split the difference.\"For Context: Windsor was posing as a religious conservative to \"shed light\" on Supreme Court ethics issues. She provided the recording exclusively toRolling Stone (Left bias).How the Media Covered it: Left-rated outlets covered the story more and tended to frame Alito's remarks negatively. Some right-rated sources\u00a0framed Windsor's behavior as unethical. Sources across the political spectrum also noted Justice Alito'srecent flag controversy.",
