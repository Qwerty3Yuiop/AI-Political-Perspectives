    "summary": "The federal investigation into Hunter Biden is raising questions about whether President Joe Biden had a role in\u00a0his son's foreign business dealings.As the federal tax investigation into Hunter Biden continues, reports across the spectrum\u00a0confirm\u00a0that executives from a Chinese energy companypaid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunterand his uncle. Emails from\u00a0a laptop hard drive that once belonged to Hunter Biden shine light on the deal, and also include mention of \"10 held by H for the big guy.\" Some speculate that the \"big guy\" was Joe Biden, and a\u00a0grand jury witness was reportedly asked to identify the \"big guy\" recently.\u00a0The president has denied involvement in\u00a0Hunter's business pursuits. Neither Joe nor Hunter has been charged with a crime.Opinions from the left often highlight the lack of hard evidence for Joe Biden's involvement in his son's foreign business dealings. One opinion writer for NBC News praised the Biden administration for\u00a0\"putting on a master\u2019s class in ethics in the federal investigation\" of Hunter, and contrasted Biden's \"hands-off\" management of the probe\u00a0to\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s \"hands everywhere\"\u00a0approach to federal investigations of him. Opinions from the right often suggest that Joe Biden was aware of Hunter's foreign business ventures and that he may have profited from them. Many on the right accuse mainstream media of being biased forinitially dismissing the Hunter Biden laptop story before recently confirming it, and predict that journalists won't thoroughly investigate Joe Biden's potential role.",
