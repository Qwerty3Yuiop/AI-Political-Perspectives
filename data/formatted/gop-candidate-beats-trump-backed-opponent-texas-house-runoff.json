    "summary": "On Tuesday, Texas state Rep. Jake Ellzey defeated fellow Republican Susan Wright in a special election runoff for Texas' sixth congressional district.Wright had been widely favored to win. She's the widow of Ron Wright, who previously held the seat, and she had the endorsement of former president Donald Trump.\u00a0Some political analysts paint the outcome as a loss for Trump and his post-election image; others say the runoff may not have been a clear test of his post-presidency clout\u00a0because the special election was open to Independents and Democrats.",
