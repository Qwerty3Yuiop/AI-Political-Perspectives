    "summary": "Following reports detailing data security concerns involving the social media app TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, the app is facing renewed calls for investigation and a possible ban in the United States. A number of states havebanned the app from state-owned devices, and in November, thecommissioner of the FCC called for a full ban.From the Left:Voices on the left have focused both on the security concerns and the potential harm caused by the app. Mark Weinstein outlined the influence and authority the Chinese Communist Party wields over the app, writing, \u201cChina recognizes TikTok's ability to influence children's development, and wields it as a weapon of manipulation.\u201d An analysis inThe Week (Lean Left)outlined aprevious unsuccessful attemptby former president Donald Trump to ban the app, determining the current effort to be \u201cultimately unlikely \u2014 but not impossible.\u201dFrom the Right:Similarly, many on the right have called for the app to be banned. The Editorial Board of the National Review called for a full ban, concluding that \u201cByteDance\u2019s connections to the Chinese Communist Party \u2026 are reason enough to bar TikTok from operating in the U.S.\u201d A writer inReason (Lean Right Bias)refuted calls for regulation, stating that claims of potential harm caused by the app have \u201clittle evidence,\u201d determining, \u201cthe idea of algorithms intentionally funneling inappropriate content to unsuspecting users not only defies logic but is antithetical to how a social media platform keeps users.\u201d",
