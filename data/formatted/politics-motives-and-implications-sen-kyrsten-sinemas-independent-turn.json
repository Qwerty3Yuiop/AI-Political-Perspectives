    "summary": "Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinemaleft the Democratic Partyand is registering as an independent. The move by Sinema, who has frequently bucked and scaled back Democratic policy proposals, is not predicted to drastically upset the balance of power in the Senate but is being framed by some as an indication of increasing frustration and dissolution with the two-party system, and by others as a political plot by Sinema to retain her position against an expected Democratic primary challenge in her next election.From the Left:Greg Sargent called Sinema\u2019s decision \u201can epic gamble born of necessity,\u201d determining it to be \u201cher only chance at keeping her Arizona Senate seat beyond 2024.\u201d A writer inNewsweek (Center Bias)saidSinema\u2019s move\u201cexposes how little she cares for the party she called home for her career\u2014and for that party's voters,\u201d determining that she is \u201cfully aware of the kamikaze mission she's on\u201d and how it will hinder both the Democratic Party and her own political ambitions moving forward.From the Right:Many on the right praised Sinema\u2019s move and predicted how the decision would impact the larger political stage. Quin Hillyer tied Sinema\u2019s announcement to a broader movement of voters away from political affiliations, stating that \u201cthe public hunger remains for candidates less interested in toeing party lines\u201d and predicting the move increasing the odds of a third-party President in the near future.Brad Polumbo (Lean Right Bias)praised Sinema anddeclared that\u201cthe people share Sinema's frustrations with both establishment parties.\u201d",
