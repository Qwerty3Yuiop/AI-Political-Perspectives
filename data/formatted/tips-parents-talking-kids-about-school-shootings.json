    "summary": "The country's response to thelatest U.S. school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texasinvolves tough questions aboutlaws and rights, but also about how to talk to children about guns and violence at schools.Since 1966, there have been 13 school shootings in the U.S. \"in which four or more victims are murdered with at least one of those homicides taking place in a public location\" and \"with no connection to underlying criminal activity,\" according to ananalysis from The Conversation (Lean Left bias). In those shootings,\u00a0146 people were killed and at least 182 injured, excluding the shooters. The three deadliest have happened in the past decade:\u00a02012\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Connecticut, when\u00a026 children and school staff were killed; 2018's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, in which\u00a017 people were killed; and Tuesday's shooting, when\u00a0at least 19 children and two adults were killed.News sources across the political spectrum highlighted tips for parents when talking to their children. Many emphasized listening, patience, and awareness of kids' social media consumption as key virtues.\u00a0Some sources from left to right showed differences in which resources and responses they recommended. One NPR article highlighted a list of resources from the American School Counselor Association, and suggested encouraging kids to take action \"in initiatives to address gun violence.\" Another Fox News\u00a0article\u00a0emphasized how parents should \"be the trusted source\" of information, and suggested encouraging kids to pray and be resilient.",
