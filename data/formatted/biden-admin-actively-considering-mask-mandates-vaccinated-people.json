    "summary": "The Biden administration is considering a return to mask mandates for all Americans, including people who are fully vaccinated, amida nationwide rise in COVID-19 casesthat followed months of decline. Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the U.S. is going \"in the wrong direction\" on COVID-19 and stressed that the pandemic now mainly exists among the \"50% of the country that are not fully vaccinated.\"Datafrom the New York Times (Lean Left bias) says the current 7-day average of new COVID-19 infections is 51,939; that number was roughly 260,000 at the pandemic's height in early January.Coverage from right-rated outlets often focused on the possible return to mask mandates, sometimes framing the idea as misguided and at odds with civil liberties. Reports from left-rated sources more often highlighted the unvaccinated, focusing on regions with low vaccinations rates and government efforts to convince people to get the shot.",
