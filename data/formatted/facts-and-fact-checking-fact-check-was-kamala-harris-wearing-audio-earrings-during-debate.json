Other userspointed outthat Harris was apparently wearing a pair of Tiffany earrings that she hadworn many timesbefore.Key Quote:Icebach toldJust The News (Lean Right bias), \u201cWe do not know whether Mrs. Harris wore one of our products. The resemblance is striking.\u201d The company also added some humor in its statement, adding, \u201cWe are currently developing a male version and will soon be able to offer it to the Trump campaign.
