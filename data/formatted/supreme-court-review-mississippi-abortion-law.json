    "headline": "Supreme Court Review Mississippi Abortion Law",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court announced Mondayit would review a major abortion dispute that could roll back abortion protections under Roe v. Wade. The case,Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, questions the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi law which banned abortions after 15 weeks.A federal judge struck down the law later that year, ruling that it conflicted with Roe v. Wade\u2019s precedent that abortion could not be banned before \u201cviability,\u201d or the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth. The review, which wasrequested by Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, will be held after the Supreme Court\u2019s summer recess and will focus on the question of \u201cwhether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nCoverage was widespread and prominently featured in outlets across the spectrum. Coverage in right-rated outlets was less likely to mention the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority.",
