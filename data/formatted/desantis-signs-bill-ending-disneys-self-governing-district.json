    "summary": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Friday that would eliminate a private government district controlled by the Walt Disney Company by June 2023.The Reedy Creek Improvement District was established in 1967 to allow Disney greater autonomy in building Walt Disney World, which would eventually become thelargest single-site employerin the country. The loss of the special district could have significant\u00a0tax implications for both Disney and nearby Florida residents.The bill was widely seen as retaliation for Disney\u2019s stated opposition to theParental Rights in Educationlaw, called the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law by opponents. WhileDisney was initially reluctantto take a stand on the controversial legislation, the entertainment giant eventually said its \u201cgoal as a company is for this law to be repealedby the legislature or struck down in the courts.\u201d DeSantis signed two other bills on Friday: one subjecting Disney to a Florida law that allows people to sue tech companies for alleged censorship, and another \u2014 the \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d \u2014 which places limits onhow schools and private businesses can discussrace, sex and nationality.Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Friday. Some coverage from left-rated outlets likeNPR (Lean Left bias)said the bill could \u201churt taxpayers\u201d in Florida. Some coverage in right rated outlets appeared to frame the bill favorably; aNew York Post (Lean Right bias)homepage tagline said, \u201cDisney's done.\u201d",
