    "summary": "As theUkrainian counter-offensivecontinues to push back Moscow forces, Russian PresidentVladimir Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a summit for the Shanghai Cooperation Organizationheld in Uzbekistan on Thursday. It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Russia launched itsinvasionearlier this year, and it was the first time Xi Jinping leftChinasince the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic.Russia and China have deepened geopolitical ties in recent decades, founding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 to counter United States global influence. The prolonged Ukraine War, however, has threatened to strain that relationship, as Beijing walks the line between supporting Moscow and abiding by Western sanctions enacted to punish the Kremlin for the war.At the meeting,Putin sought to address concerns from China, which is already facing economic turbulence on account of continued COVID-19 lockdowns. Putin voiced support for Beijing\u2019s continued soft-conflict with the island ofTaiwan, which the Chinese government classifies as a rogue province and insists must be incorporated into the Chinese system. This comes after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosivisited Taiwan last month, an action that drew sharp criticism from Beijing, who retaliated byconducting military drillsin the strait between China and the island.The meeting between the leaders was covered mildly across the spectrum, with most outlets also noting Iran\u2019s recent announcement that it would join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.",
