    "summary": "The World Health Organization on Wednesday called for a moratorium on COVID-19 vaccine booster shots until at least the end of September to give all countries the chance to vaccinate at least 10% of their populations with at least one dose. The same day, the world saw its200 millionth detected case of COVID-19, as countries with low vaccination ratescontinued to struggleunder the pandemic.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusexplained the move, saying, \u201cSo far, more than 4 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally. More than 80% have gone to high- and upper-middle income countries, even though they account for less than half of the world\u2019s population. I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the world\u2019s most vulnerable people remain unprotected.\u201dCoverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum and more prevalent in left- and center-rated outlets. As of Wednesday evening, most major\u00a0right-rated outlets used anAssociated Press articlefor their coverage.",
