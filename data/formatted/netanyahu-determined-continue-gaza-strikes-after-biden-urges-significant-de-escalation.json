    "headline": "Netanyahu Determined Continue Gaza Strikes After Biden Urges Significant De Escalation",
    "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was \u201cdetermined to continue\u201d Israeli operations in Gaza after President Joe Biden told him he \u201cexpected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire\u201d in a Wednesday phone call. This wasthe latest of four callsbetween the two leaders this week;Biden previously called Netanyahuand Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday, reiterating his support for Israel\u2019s right to self-defense and voicing concern over thebombing of journalists\u2019 offices. As of Wednesday afternoon, the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel has led to 12 Israeli resident deaths and 227 Palestinian deaths; Gaza's dense population and lack of protections likeIsrael's Iron Dome defense systemcontributed to the disproportionate death counts. \n\nCoverage in right-rated outlets tended to frame Netanyahu as \u201cbrushing off\u201d Biden and called Hamas a \"terrorist organization.\" Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to focus more on deaths and damage from the conflict and called Hamas a \"militant group.\"",
