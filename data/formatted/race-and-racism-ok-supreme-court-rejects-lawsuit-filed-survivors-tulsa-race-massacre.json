    "summary": "The Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit filed by survivors of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre.For Context:It is estimated that over 300 people were killed and thousands were left homeless in 1921 when a white mob attacked and burned Tulsa\u2019s Greenwood neighborhood, an affluent black community known as \u201cBlack Wall Street.\u201d Lessie Benningfield Randle, 108, Viola Fletcher, 109, and Hughes Van Ellis, 102, are living survivors of the massacre and were among the plaintiffs in the case. The plaintiffs argued that the massacre amounted to a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201dDetails:Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Dustin Rowe deemed the plaintiffs\u2019 grievances \u201clegitimate,\u201d but concluded \u201cthey do not fall within the scope of our state's public nuisance statute.\u201d Rowe, added, \u201cThe continuing blight alleged within the Greenwood community born out of the massacre implicates generational-societal inequities that can only be resolved by policymakers--not the courts.\u201dKey Quotes:Following the ruling, Ike Howard, grandson of Viola Fletcher, stated, \u201cThey were blighted and once again not made whole. We still remain blighted. We wish the D.O.J would investigate. \u2026 How can we get justice in the same city that created the nuisance? Is justice only for the rich?\u201d The City of Tulsa released a statement reading, \u201cThe City of Tulsa respects the court\u2019s decision and affirms the significance of the work the City continues to do in the North Tulsa and Greenwood communities.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:Left- and center-rated outlets covered the ruling more frequently and prominently.",
