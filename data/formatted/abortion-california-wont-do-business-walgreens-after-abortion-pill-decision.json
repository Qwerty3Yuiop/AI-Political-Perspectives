We're done.\u201d A spokesperson for Newsom told The Washington Examiner that \u201cCalifornia is reviewing all relationships between Walgreens and the state. We will not pursue business with companies that cave to right wing bullies pushing their extremist agenda or companies that put politics above the health of women and girls.\u201dFor Context:On Friday, Walgreens announced it would not distribute abortion pills in 21 states after Republican attorney generals in those states threatened action against the pharmacy. California is not one of the states included in Walgreens' decision. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, Newsom has been a vocal proponent of abortion access,signing a bill in Septemberthat protected abortion access in the state, and prohibited California law enforcement from aiding agencies in other states investigating individuals who potentially traveled to California to get a lawful abortion.How The Media Covered It:Outlets covered the announcement across the spectrum Monday evening. The New Republic highlighted the unanswered questions surrounding the announcement, such as what the decision means for existing Walgreens Pharmacies in the state.",
