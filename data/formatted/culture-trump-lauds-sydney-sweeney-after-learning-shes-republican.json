    "summary": "In light of actressSydney Sweeney\u2019s \u201cGreat Jeans\u201d ad campaign for American Eagle, reports have surfaced that she is a registered Republican, drawing praise from President Donald Trump.The Details:Sweeney registered to vote in Florida on June 24, 2024, shortly after she purchased a home there, and listed her party affiliation as Republican, according to publicly available records.To Reporters:When a reporter asked Trump his thoughts on her political affiliation, he said, \u201cShe's a registered Republican? Oh, now I love her ad.\u201d He added, \u201cYou'd be surprised at how many people are Republicans. That's what I wouldn't have known, but I'm glad you told me that. If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.\u201dOn Truth Social:Trump laterwrote\u201cSydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the \u2018HOTTEST\u2019 ad out there. It\u2019s for American Eagle, and the jeans are \u2018flying off the shelves.\u2019 Go get \u2018em Sydney! On the other side of the ledger, Jaguar did a stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement, THAT IS A TOTAL DISASTER!\u201d He added, \u201cOr just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift\u2026 She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT. The tide has seriously turned \u2014 Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.\u201dFor Context:Some have criticized the ad asresembling \u201cNazi propaganda\u201d or promoting eugenics. Sweeney, who has blonde hair and blue eyes, is best known for her roles in shows like Euphoria and The White Lotus. In May, Trumpwrote, \u201cHas anyone noticed that, since I said \u2018I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,\u2019 she\u2019s no longer \u2018HOT?\u2019 American Eagle\u2019s stock rose in the midst of Sweeney\u2019s campaign, and jumped another 14 points after President Trump\u2019s remarks.How The Media Covered It:The story was widely covered across the spectrum.The Guardian (Left bias)noted Sweeney\u2019s registration came \u201cabout two weeks after Trump, another registered Republican Florida voter, was convicted in New York City of criminal falsification of business records.\u201d The Guardian also included, \u201cIt was also about two years after Sweeney, 27, faced criticism from some US media consumers after she was photographed at her mother\u2019s birthday party where several of the guests were seen wearing hats that called to mind those which bear Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 (Maga) slogan.\u201dWritten by the AllSides staff (of humans).Learn more.Support our mission.",
