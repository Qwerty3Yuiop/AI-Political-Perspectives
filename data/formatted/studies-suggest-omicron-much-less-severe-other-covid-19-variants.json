    "headline": "Studies Suggest Omicron Much Less Severe Other Covid 19 Variants",
    "summary": "Two studies published Wednesday suggest that the highly contagious Omicron variant of COVID-19 is much less likely to cause hospitalization and severe illness than the previously-dominant Delta variant.A study of cases in the United Kingdomfrom researchers at the Imperial College Londonestimated that Omicron patients were 20-25% less likely to need hospital care and 40-45% less likely to be hospitalized for one night or more than Delta variant patients. Astudy of cases in South Africafrom the country's National Institute for Communicable Diseases also found that Omicron patients were 80% less likely to be hospitalized than other COVID-19 patients, and said the difference was \"likely a result of high population immunity.\" Neither study has yet been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization's COVID-19 lead said Wednesday that because the variant hasn't\u00a0circulated \"for long enough in populations around the world,\" it's still too early to draw conclusions about its severity. The Omicron variant reportedly\u00a0accounts for roughly three-quarters of U.S. COVID-19 cases, andas much as 90% in some areas. So far, very few COVID-19 deaths have been attributed to Omicron relative to other variants.Media outlets across the political spectrum framed the studies as a positive development. Some reports from left- and center-rated sources highlighted how health authorities are still urging caution alongside the optimistic studies. Some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on how the U.K. study also suggested that natural immunity reduces the risk of hospitalization and multi-night hospital stays by over 50%.",
