    "headline": "Where Does Biden Stand Abortion",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden's stance on abortion has evolved over time.Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Biden said \"basic fairness and the stability of our law demand\" thatRoe v. Wadebe preserved. He called abortion protections \"a fundamental right\" and pledged to \"work to\u00a0pass and sign into law\" legislation codifyingRoe v. Wade,while\u00a0also saying\u00a0he's\u00a0\"not prepared\" to judge whether the Senate should remove the filibuster to do that.In the past, Biden's stance on abortion rights has been inconsistent. In 1981 as a senator, hevoted fora constitutional amendment to allow states to overturnRoe.He then opposed it when it came up again for vote in 1982. Biden was also a\u00a0longtime supporter of the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funding for abortions, beforeshifting to oppose itduring his 2020 presidential campaign.Coverage from many right-rated outlets, as well as some left- and center-rated ones, frames abortion as an uncomfortable issue for Biden. Many news sources on the right highlight Biden's former support for allowing states to overturnRoe, and frame him as a hypocrite forinvoking his Catholic faithwhile also supporting abortion rights. Left-rated outlets haven't covered Biden's personal abortion stance as much. OneanalysisfromAP Politics (Lean Left bias)said leading the fight for abortion rights is \"not a natural role for [Biden], despite his longtime defense of a woman\u2019s right to choose.\"",
