    "headline": "House Gop Report Condemns Bidens Afghanistan Withdrawal",
    "summary": "A new House Republican report has\u00a0condemned a series of perceived failuresof the Biden administration's Afghanistan withdrawal strategy.The \"interim\" GOP report, released on theone-year anniversary of\u00a0the U.S. evacuating Afghanistan,claims the White Housedidn't follow through on\u00a0key strategiesto\u00a0evacuate civilians from Kabul until the final hours before the city fell to the Taliban. Data from the investigation highlighted how the State Department has evacuated more than 800 Americans from Afghanistan since Aug. 31,which contradicts Biden's commitmentto\u00a0evacuate\u00a0the approximate 100 Americans who wanted to leave by that date.The report also\u00a0revealed that\u00a0a \"significant\"\u00a0number of U.S.-trained Afghan commandos migrated to Iranwith military equipment after the Taliban took over the country. Other key findings found that Biden withdrew forces from Afghanistan despite warnings from top generals, and\u00a0linked the \"sloppy\" backlog\u00a0at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in\u00a0Kabul to a staff shortage.Reports across the spectrum noted that the GOP will likely make the Afghanistan investigations\u00a0a key priorityif they reclaim the majority in Congress afterthe midterm elections this fall.",
