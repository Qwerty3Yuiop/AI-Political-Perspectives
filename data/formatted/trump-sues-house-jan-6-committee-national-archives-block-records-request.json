    "summary": "Former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0filed a lawsuit Monday against the House's Jan. 6 Committee and the National Archives in an effort to keep his presidential records classified.The court filingcites\u00a0executive privilege, and argues that the committee\u2019s request is too broad and amounts to an \"illegal fishing expedition.\" Committee members called Trump's lawsuit \"an attempt to delay and obstruct our probe.\" The committee is seeking a wide range of records from Trump's time in office in connection with its investigation of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, including the former president's discussions with lawyers, advisors, other politicians and world leaders. On Oct. 8, the White House said it wouldn't allow Trump to use executive privilege to block the records requests.The news was covered across the spectrum. Some reports from left-rated sources highlighted the violent events of Jan. 6 and described Trump's efforts to avoid the probe as \"aggressive.\" Coverage from right-rated outlets focused more on the details of Trump's lawsuit.",
