    "summary": "Former President Barack Obama's 60th birthday party was covered by both left and right media this past week, but for different reasons. Obama's party Saturday on Martha's Vineyard featured friends, family and high-profile celebrities; avideoposted to social media showed guests dancing and singing with the former president. Obama's spokespersonsaid last weekthat they would\u00a0\"significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends\"\u00a0due \"to the new spread of the Delta variant.\" Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondesignated Martha's Vineyard an area with \"high\" community COVID-19 transmission.The party was a bigger story on the right side of the media spectrum overall. Right-rated outlets and voices often highlighted the fact that guests weren't wearing masks, and accused mainstream media of ignoring the party and potential COVID-19 concerns; some on the right broke from that narrative,saying the\u00a0Obamas shouldn't be criticizedbecause they\u00a0\"did what everyone should be allowed to do.\" The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reported last Thursdaythat Obama had canceled\u00a0the party; the same day, Snopes (Lean Left)published a fact-checkof the claim that Obama\u00a0scaled back the party, rating it as \"True.\"\u00a0The few left-rated outlets that published coverage after the partyfocused on the celebrity guestsand analyzing Obama's future.",
