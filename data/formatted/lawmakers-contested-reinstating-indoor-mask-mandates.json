    "summary": "Lawmakers have been contested onwhether to reinstate\u00a0indoor mask mandates.Over\u00a060% of Americans are currently residing in counties that entered the \"high\" category of\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0cases where the CDC recommends\u00a0masking in indoor settings for all people\u00a0regardless of\u00a0vaccination status, according todataposted\u00a0by the public health organization. Several cities and counties, including\u00a0Los Angeles, have avoided enforcing indoor mask mandates.\u00a0LA County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Wednesday paused the implementation of universal masking\u00a0due to a \"a fairly steady decline\" of cases and hospitalization rates, indicating that the numbers are\"potentially signaling to an end\" of the latest surge caused by the BA.5 variant. On the other hand, San Diego Unified School District started reinforing indoor mask mandates amid an uptick of COVID cases during summer school sessions.Left-rated coveragehighlighted public health officials' \"concern\" that Americans have returned to their normal lives \"without a second thought\" of pandemic restrictions or the\u00a0\"surge\" in\u00a0COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations\u00a0being detected in some areas.Right-rated outletsaccentuated\u00a0a downtick in COVID-19 cases and spotlighted critics who accused\u00a0Ferrer of\u00a0\"lying to the public\" about the virus.",
