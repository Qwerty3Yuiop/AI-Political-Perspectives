    "headline": "Would Inflation Reduction Act Boost Savings Or Raise Costs Americans",
    "summary": "Democrats working to pass the'Inflation Reduction Act'faceclaims that the bill would lead to higher costsfor Americans.The bill aims to raise billions of dollars over the next decade to reduce debt and fund climate change and energy programs.\u00a0Ananalysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)suggests it\u00a0wouldraise $16.7 billion in tax revenue from Americans earning less than $200,000/yearin 2023 and would raise taxes by $326 billion in the next decade. The analysisalso suggests that tax increases will be frontloaded, and that by 2027, hikes for many income groups will ease. TheWhite HouseandTreasury Secretary Janet Yellenrebuked\u00a0reports that Americans making less than $400,000/year would see higher taxes, which would break a 2020 campaign pledge from President Joe Biden.Left- and\u00a0right-rated sources framed fiscal analysis of the bill very differently.TheNew York Times (Lean Left bias)said the JCT reportshowedthe bill \"would not cement a giant tax increase or result in profligate federal spending.\" Yahoo News highlighted research that suggested the bill \"would save the average household $1,800 per year on energy bills.\" Conversely, Fox Business said the report showed that \"every tax bracket would pay more in taxes,\" and theWall Street Journal Editorial Board (Lean Right bias)calledthe proposed bill \"a tax increase on nearly every American.\" Many on the right juxtaposed the purported tax increases\u00a0with Biden's tax-increase campaign pledge.",
