    "headline": "Voting Rights Hot Topic Georgia 53000 Applications Put Hold",
    "summary": "A report by the Associated Press revealed that over 53,000 voter applications, 70 percent of which are from African Americans, are currently on hold in Georgia, a state with a tight gubernatorial race between Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams. Kemp is currently in charge of voter registration in the state, and has been accused of implementing voter roll purges and his controversial \"exact match\" verification process in order to sway the election in his favor, a charge that he denies. The ACLU has since issued a statement, saying that individuals with pending applications can cast a regular ballot if they are able to show a photo ID that reflects the name and address used on the registration form.\n\nThis issue was not covered by Right-leaning publications.",
