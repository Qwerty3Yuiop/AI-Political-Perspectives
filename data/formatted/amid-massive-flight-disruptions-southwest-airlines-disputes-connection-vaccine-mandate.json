    "summary": "Amid a series of massive flight disruptions,\u00a0Southwest Airlinesdenounced\u00a0\u201cunfounded rumor and speculation\u201dthat\u00a0the\u00a0company\u2019s recent decision to mandate vaccinations spurred cancellations and delays. The airlineattributed the \"high volume of cancellations\"and delays to \u201cweather challenges\u201d in Florida and\u00a0\u201cunexpected air traffic control issues in the same region.\u201d Southwest canceled a total of 1,826 flights and delayed 1,784 flights on Saturday and Sunday,according to data from FlightAware. The disruptions continued into Monday with over 360\u00a0cancellations and 1,300\u00a0delays.\u00a0Other airlines were not as severely\u00a0impacted by these issues; airlines such as American and Spirit canceled\u00a02% of flights over the holiday weekend.\u00a0The\u00a0Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) on Fridayfiled a motion to temporarily block the airline's COVID-19 vaccine mandateuntil an ongoing lawsuit over alleged U.S. labor law violations is resolved; the airline emphasized that the matter won't \"require negotiation\" moving forward. SWAPA\u00a0released a statement thatclaimed pilots and airline staff were not planning a sickout\u00a0over the company's vaccination requirements, saying that\u00a0\"management's poor planning\" and \"external operational challenges\" were more probable causes of the cancellations.Coverage was prominent across the spectrum, with many outlets citing conflicting tallies for the total number of flights\u00a0canceled. Right-rated voices\u00a0were more likely to link\u00a0the cancellations to\u00a0vaccine mandates protests, anarrative advanced by Texas Republicans Ted CruzandChip Royon Twitter.\u00a0Some left-rated voices criticized those outlets for making such a connection \"even though they offered no evidence of it.\"",
