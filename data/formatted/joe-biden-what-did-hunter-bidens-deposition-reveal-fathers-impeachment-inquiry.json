    "headline": "Joe Biden What Did Hunter Bidens Deposition Reveal Fathers Impeachment Inquiry",
    "summary": "Hunter Biden finished a closed-door testimony on Thursday as part of Republicans' impeachment inquiry into his father, President Joe Biden.The Details:According to a transcript of thetestimony, Hunter acknowledged his father's presence on some business calls and meetings, but maintained that Joe didn't profit from or actively participate in them. Hunter acknowledged that a former business partner was indeed referring to Joe Biden when he suggested giving a 10% stake in Chinese company CEFC China Energy Co.\u00a0\"to the big guy,\" but Hunter said he immediately shut down the idea. Hunter also \"admitted that he was high or drunk\" when he texted a Chinese business associate in 2017 saying, \"I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled.\"For Context:The Biden family's business dealings are at the center of the impeachment probe. Hunter's businesses received more than $5 million in payments from his Chinese associates in the days following that\u00a0text.How the Media Covered It:Right-rated sources often highlighted specific revelations from the testimony, especially Hunter's acknowledgment of\u00a0messages involving \"the big guy.\" Left-rated outlets often highlighted how\u00a0Hunter and his attorneys criticized\u00a0Republicans.ABC News (Lean Left bias)said the testimony \"appeared to include no major bombshells.\"Why the Difference?Many Democrats see the impeachment inquiry and scrutiny of Hunter as highly politicized. Many on the right see Democrats as unwilling to acknowledge potential evidence of\u00a0illegal activity by\u00a0the Bidens.",
