    "summary": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)announced Thursdaythat the U.S. will spend $3.2 billion on developing antiviral pills to treat COVID-19. The program, titled The Antiviral Program for Pandemics, will enhance current clinical trials of several potential COVID-19 treatments, with the goal of gaining FDA approval for at least one in the next year. Funding will come from President Joe Biden'sAmerican Rescue Plan. Once approved, the medicine would be available over-the-counter to treat COVID-19 symptoms; the treatments\u00a0could be especially key for\u00a0immunocompromised people, who, even if they've received a vaccine, are unlikely to have\u00a0full\u00a0protection compared to healthy people.The\u00a0news was similarly covered across the spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated sources pointed out that the Trump administration spent a lot of resources on COVID-19 vaccine development, but not as much on developing treatments. Reports from left-rated outlets were more likely to attribute the investment announcement to \"the Biden administration,\" rather than to \"the U.S.\" or \"HHS.\"",
