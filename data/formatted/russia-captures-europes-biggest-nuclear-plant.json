    "summary": "Russian troops reportedly took control of Europe's largest nuclear energy plant Friday in southeastern Ukraine, sparking concern across the world and the U.S. political spectrum.A fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant reportedly caused by Russian shelling was extinguished by Ukrainian firefighters early Friday,\u00a0according to Ukraine's nuclear regulator. Russian authorities claimed that Ukrainians had attacked the plant. Staff at the\u00a0plant are reportedly working at gunpoint, but government officials remained in contact with plant management. Officials from\u00a0Ukraine's nuclear power operator say the plant's nuclear reactors are now safe, but that more attacks could lead to major disaster. Representatives from the\u00a0International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, reportedly plan to\u00a0travel to Ukraine to negotiate the safe operation of all Ukrainian power plants with Russian forces. There are five nuclear power plants in Ukraine, including the now-closed Chernobyl,which is also under Russian control.The news was the top story from outlets across the political spectrum Friday, with many speculating about the consequences of a nuclear disaster and the potential for Russia to use the plant as leverage in future peace negotiations. Some reports highlighted experts who said an explosion at the plant would have caused much more damage than the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, which remains the worst nuclear plant catastrophe in history.",
