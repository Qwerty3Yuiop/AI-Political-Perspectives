    "summary": "The U.S. House passed a bill Tuesday that would remove statues of figures from history associated with the Confederacy, slavery or racism.\u00a0The legislation would remove\u00a0several statues of Confederate leaders\u00a0currently displayed in the U.S. Capitol under the National Statuary Hall Collection; it would also replace a bust of Roger B. Taney with Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court justice.\u00a0The bill garnered a 285-120 bipartisan vote in favor, with 67 Republicans joining all Democrats present. Some\u00a0GOP members\u00a0said the removal process should the responsibility of individual\u00a0states; each state is allowed to put two statues in the U.S. Capitol. The House voted to remove the statues last year, but the bill stalled in the then-Republican led Senate. House Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not yet said whether he will bring up the bill, thoughHouse Democrats say it is likely.The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated sources framed the statues as more problematic than coverage\u00a0from right-rated sources did.",
