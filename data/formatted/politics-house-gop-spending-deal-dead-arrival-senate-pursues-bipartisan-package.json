    "summary": "House Republicans reached a deal on a bill to fund the government through October 31, with some provisions that will likely make it a non-starter in the Democrat-controlled Senate.The Details:The bill would cut about 8% from all non-defense budgets except for the Department of Veterans Affairs, resulting in a cut of about 1% in the overall budget. It also includes measures from an immigration bill passed by House Republicans in May, and it lacks additional funding for Ukraine.For Context:The bill was negotiated by the self-described pragmatic Main Street Caucus and the more conservative Freedom Caucus \u2014 the same group thatopposed the debt ceiling deal earlier this year. However, the bill has been criticized by some hard-line Republicans \u2014 enough that it could fail to pass even in the House.Hope for Bipartisanship?House Democrats, who oppose the GOP bill, sent Speaker Kevin McCarthy a letter on Sunday urging him to drop Republicans' party-line bill and instead put the Senate's bipartisan appropriations bill up for a vote. However, some conservative Republicans have threatened to pull their support for McCarthy\u2019s speakership if he compromises with Democrats.How the Media Covered It:While there were some partisan differences, news coverage across the news media described the bill as \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the Senate. While The Daily Signal (Right bias) called the bill\u2019s immigration provisions \u201cconservative border security legislation,\u201d The New York Times (Lean Left bias) called them \u201ctough Trump-era border initiatives.\u201d",
