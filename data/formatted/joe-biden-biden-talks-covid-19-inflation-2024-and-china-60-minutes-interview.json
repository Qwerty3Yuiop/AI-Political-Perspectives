He also said the U.S. woulddefend and send troops to Taiwanin the event of an \"unprecedented attack\" from China. And when asked about possiblyrunning for president again in 2024, Bidenreaffirmedhis \"intention\" to run, but said his final decision \"remains to be seen.\"News sources across the political spectrumcovered the interview, and many highlighted Biden's remarks about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and his potential 2024 presidential campaign. Some left-rated outlets, such asNPRandThe Guardian (Lean Left bias), contrasted Biden's pandemic remark with data about ongoing COVID-19\u00a0case count and deaths. Some right-rated outlets instead highlighted Biden's remarks on inflation; Fox Business said Biden \"attempted to downplay the U.S. inflation crisis.\" OneNational Review (Right bias)writerarguedthat Biden saying\u00a0the pandemic is over shows that his student loan forgiveness order is illegal because it \"rested entirely upon there being an ongoing emergency.\"",
