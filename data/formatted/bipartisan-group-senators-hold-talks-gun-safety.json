    "headline": "Bipartisan Group Senators Hold Talks Gun Safety",
    "summary": "A bipartisan group of senators has begun meeting to find common ground on gun safety legislation.Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy, Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, Martin Heinrich and Richard Blumenthal reportedly met over lunch with Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Pat Toomey, Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy on Thursday, two days after agunman shot and killed 21 people at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Some, including Manchin, Graham, Blumenthal, Toomey and Murphy, have spearheaded similarly bipartisan efforts in the past. Reports across the political spectrum suggest that the group may be approaching a consensus on some safety measures, such as improved school security systems.Another potential area of common ground is on red-flag and yellow-flag laws and a federal grant program to encourage states to adopt those\u00a0laws, though some Republicans remain skeptical.\u00a0Red-flag laws have been implemented in19 states, and\u00a0allow courts to temporarily confiscate firearms belonging to people deemed to be a risk to others or themselves.\u00a0Petitioners, such as family members or law enforcement,\u00a0must present evidence\u00a0on why individuals pose a threat. Yellow-flag laws allow only law enforcement\u00a0to petition the courts to temporarily confiscate guns\u00a0from those people.News sources across the spectrum highlighted the group's bipartisan nature and their potential to agree on issues such as red-flag laws, while many sources also framed\u00a0total Republican approval of the laws as unlikely.",
