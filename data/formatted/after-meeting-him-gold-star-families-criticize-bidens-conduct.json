    "summary": "President Joe Biden fielded criticism this week from some of the families ofthe 13 U.S. service members killed in the Kabul suicide bombinglast Thursday. Biden met with some of the families Sunday at Dover Air Force Base and spoke with each privately; after the meetings, Biden and First Lady Jill Biden attended the final dignified transfer of the bodies of the 13. The family of Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz accused Biden of discussing his son Beau Biden more than their own during their meeting, as did the mother\u00a0of Lance Cpl.\u00a0Kareem M. Nikoui, who also accused Biden of rolling his eyes during their meeting. The family of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover declined to meet with Biden; Hoover's father said they didn't want Biden \"anywhere near us.\" Members of the three families alsoaccused Biden of glancing at his watch multiple times during the dignified transfer.Many major right-rated outlets have\u00a0focused significantly on Biden's meetings with theGold Star familiesand their criticism of his conduct. The families' criticism received much less attention from left- and center-rated media, though some did offer in-depth reports and interviews with the families.",
