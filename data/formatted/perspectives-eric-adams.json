    "summary": "Brooklyn Borough President and former police captain Eric Adams won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City on Wednesday.\u00a0Declaring himself as\u00a0\u201cthe new face of the Democratic Party,\u201d Adams has\u00a0appealed to centric,\u00a0working-class\u00a0voters and\u00a0promoted\u00a0a balance between \"fighting crime and ending racial injustice in policing.\"Many\u00a0outlets across the political spectrum are claiming\u00a0that Adams' political vision for New York City still remains unclear. Some left-rated voices described Adams as someone with \"more alignments than plans\"; some right-rated voices labeled the potential future mayor as \"a somewhat confounding politician.\" Center-leaning outlets mostly avoided this political discourse,\u00a0instead highlighting\u00a0his current plans to\u00a0bolster affordable housing, public transit and racial equality.",
