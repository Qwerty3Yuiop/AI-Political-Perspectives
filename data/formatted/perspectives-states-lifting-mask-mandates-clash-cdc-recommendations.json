    "summary": "Federal COVID-19 masking guidance is at odds with new rules in many states \u2014 regardless of whether the state is led by a Republican or\u00a0Democrat.California, New York and a number of other Democrat-led states announced plans this week todrop some or all COVID-19 mask mandates, and nearly every state in the U.S. now plans toend mask mandates by the end of March. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends masks indoors in areas of high COVID-19 transmission, and CDC director Rochelle Walensky said this week that masks should still be worn\"essentially everywhere in the country in public indoor settings.\"The White House has not said whether it will extend the federal mask mandate for public transit, trains, airplanes, and airports that is set to expire on March 18.Perspectives from left-rated voices oftenframed the new opposition to mask mandatesas a product of Democrats playing intonationwide feelings of pandemic\u00a0fatigueheading into the2022 midterm elections. Coverage from the left also tended to highlight voices who are concerned about mask mandates potentially being lifted too early. Views from right-rated voices typically criticized the lifting of mask mandates as overdue.\u00a0Coverage from the right usually focused on falling COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, as well as parents,Republican lawmakersand others\u00a0who are critical of mask mandates. Voices on both sides criticized\u00a0the Biden administration and the CDC for purportedly beingtoo slow to issue clear, science-backed federal COVID-19 guidance on mask-wearing.",
