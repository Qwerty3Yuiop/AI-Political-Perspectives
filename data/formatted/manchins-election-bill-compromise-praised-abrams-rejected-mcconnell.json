    "summary": "On Wednesday,\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin\u00a0(D-W.Va.)released a list of proposed changesto\u00a0Democrats' For the People Act\u00a0intended as a bipartisan compromise. Manchin, who opposed the initial version of the bill, proposed an edited version that\u00a0would ban gerrymandering, require a minimum of 15 consecutive days of early voting, enact\u00a0a voter ID requirement with alternate ways of identification, and make Election Day a holiday. Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams praised Manchin's version during an appearance on CNN Thursday, saying, \"the restrictions on the forms of ID should meet the needs of the people. And what he is proposing makes sense because...we should not narrow the playing field so much that we push voters out of participation simply because of restrictions that make no sense and do not increase security.\"\u00a0However,\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he\u00a0opposed\u00a0Manchin's version, saying it would turn the Federal Election Commission (FEC) \"from a judge into a prosecutor\" and would \"remove redistricting from state legislatures and hand it over to computers.\"\u00a0McConnell added\u00a0that he hoped \"all Republicans\" would oppose the proposal.\u00a0The Democrats' bill is set for a vote early next week, where it needs 60 votes to pass the 50-50 Senate.Manchin's bill, Abrams' praise, and McConnell's rejection received wide coverage from across the political spectrum; outlets from all sides provided speculation as to the bill's likelihood of passing in the Senate next week.",
