    "summary": "After months of debate and bipartisan negotiations, the Senate passed the Biden administration's$1.2 trillion infrastructure packageon Tuesday. The vote was 69-30, with 19 Republican senators joining all 50 Democrats in support; Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was among those who voted in favor. If passed,\u00a0the legislation\u00a0will\u00a0provide over $500\u00a0billion\u00a0in federal funding for highways, waterworks, and broadband. It will also \"establish a pilot program to demonstrate a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee\" and put forth \"strategies to reduce the climate change impacts of the surface transportation system.\" The bill now goes to the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it won't be considered unless the Senate also passesa more polarizing $3.5 trillion budget package.Coverage from left- and center-rated sources often framed the passage as a bipartisan victory for Biden, while mentioning that its future in the House is currently uncertain. Reports from right-rated sources often framed progressive Democrats in a negative light for opposing\u00a0the infrastructure bill unless the larger budget plan is approved.",
