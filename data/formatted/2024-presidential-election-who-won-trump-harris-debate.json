    "headline": "2024 Presidential Election Who Won Trump Harris Debate",
    "summary": "Media outlets and pundits weighed in on who won last night's presidential debate in Philadelphia.Vice President Kamala Harris: TheNew York Times(Lean Left bias)\u00a0concluded that Harris succeeded in provoking Trump into veering off message, particularly when Harris suggested Trump's rallies were boring and when she mentioned Trump's criminal conviction and legal issues.National Review(Right bias) reported that Harris won the presidential debate, but that ABC assisted her by not fact-checking her during the debate while they fact-checked Trump about five times.\u00a0Some pundits concluded Harris did not have convincing reasons for why her positions had changed on some economic issues.Former President Donald Trump: Some media outlets noted Trump's statement that the withdrawal of the U.S. from Afghanistan resulted\u00a0in equipment and resources being left behind, and Harris did not respond to the\u00a0moderator's question on whether she felt responsible. He also reminded voters that Harris\u00a0had supported fracking, and defunding the police. Trump also may have scored points when he pointed out that even with critics saying his tariffs\u00a0would raise prices, he had low inflation when he was president.National Reviewconcluded that Trump missed an opportunity to come out strong, and that he led himself down some \"blind alleys\" such as disputing crowd sizes and defending January 6 rioters.In summary, many Trump allies are claiming victory, but many conservative commentatorsdisagree.\u00a0Some of the left said Harris won,\u00a0but that itmight not matter much.The Harris campaign is already calling foranother debate.",
