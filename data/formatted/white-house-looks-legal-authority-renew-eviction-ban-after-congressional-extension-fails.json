In a June 29 concurring opinion toa Supreme Court decision upholding the ban,Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrotethat Congress had the authority to extend the eviction ban beyond July. In lieu of a congressional extension, Biden asked landlords and local\u00a0governments\u00a0to hold off on evictions while the administration searched for a legal way to extend the ban.Coverage across the spectrum pointed out that \u201cmillions of renters\u201d could face eviction as a result of the eviction ban ending.
