    "summary": "Comedian Shane Gillis, who was fired from SNL in 2019 over a joke he previously made on a podcast, hosted the show on Saturday, drawing media perspectives.Bigotry Sells:Dean Obeidallah ofCNN (Left Bias)emphasized much of Gillis\u2019s comedy being \u201coff-base\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d toward marginalized groups and pitched the idea that former President Donald Trump is responsible for the \"coarsening of our social and cultural norms.\" Obeidallah conceded that \u201ccomedians should never be held to the same standard as politicians,\u201d but that they are not \u201cimmune\u201d from criticism either, and Gillis\u2019s widespread success proves that \u201cbigotry\u201d is \u201clucrative.\u201dMeh:Zach Vasquez, writing forThe Guardian (Left bias)described Gillis\u2019s comic persona as \u201cthat of a meat-headed conservative bro\u201d but argued his material \u201cmore often than not ridicules that demographic, and with far sharper accuracy than ostensibly left-leaning comedy (including and especially SNL).\u201d Vasquez said Gillis didn\u2019t bomb nor kill, and considering the amount of \u201cheated online discourse\u201d leading up to it, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine anyone feeling strongly about this episode one way or another.\u201dCulture Is Healing:Tom Slater ofSpiked (Lean Right bias)said, \u201cGillis\u2019s fall and rise is a reminder of how brutal cancel culture can be \u2013 and how spectacularly it can backfire.\u201d He argued Gillis triumphed because he \u201crefused to issue a groveling apology (or) refashion himself as a conservative culture warrior.\u201d Slater\u00a0also praised Gillis\u2019s balanced political approach to comedy and said the \u201cold gatekeepers\u201d are realizing they\u2019re not nearly as influential as they once were and need talents like Gillis more than the talents need them.",
