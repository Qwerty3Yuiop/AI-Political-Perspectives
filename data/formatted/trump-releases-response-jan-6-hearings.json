    "summary": "As the House select committee probing the Jan. 6 Capitol riot begins to release its findings inpublic hearings, former President Donald Trump has released a12-page responseon the \"sham investigation.\"In the statement, Trump accused Democrats of using the investigation \"to\u00a0distract the American people from the great pain they are experiencing\" withhigh inflation,baby formula shortagesand other crises. He said Democrats are \"desperate to change the narrative of a failing nation, without even making mention of the havoc and death caused by the Radical Left just months earlier,\" a reference to the summer 2020 protests and riots following the murder of George Floyd.Trump also rehashed hisunsubstantiated claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him, and praised Dinesh D'Souza's new documentary \"2000 Mules,\" which Trump said \"provides video evidence of the ballot trafficking scheme Democrats have created.\" Fact-checkers on all sides have saidthe documentary is misleadinganddoesn't provide evidenceof decisive voter fraud. Trump's statement ends by saying \"the United States is being destroyed,\" and that \"we have to Save America.\"News sources across the political spectrum covered Trump's response. Some coverage from right-rated sources focused more on Trump's comments about inflation, gas prices and baby formula. Coverage from the left typically focused on disproving Trump's 2020 election claims.",
