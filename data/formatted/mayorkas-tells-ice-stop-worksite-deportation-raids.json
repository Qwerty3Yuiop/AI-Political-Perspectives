    "summary": "Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in amemosent Tuesday to cease\u00a0mass worksite deportation raids.\u00a0Mayorkas said the Biden administration would instead focus on penalizing employers who hire immigrants without work authorizations, rather than the immigrants themselves.\u00a0The memo also instructed DHS officials to\u00a0consider temporary legal status for\u00a0unauthorized immigrants who allegedly faced labor exploitation instead of immediately placing them\u00a0in deportation proceedings.Coverage from right-rated sources often framed the announcement as an example of government overreach and an unnecessary limitation\u00a0of\u00a0immigration enforcement. Some coverage from left-rated sources highlighted examples of large worksite raids carried out during the Trump administration and juxtaposed them with the Biden administration's new directive.",
