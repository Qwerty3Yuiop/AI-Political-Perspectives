Notable shifts included conservative Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s party doubling its seats and French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party losing its majority, leading the Prime Minister to call a snap election.Other Trends:Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party surged, coming in second in Germany\u2019s elections.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s populist Fidesz partysecured a victory butceded some groundto surging political newcomer P\u00e9ter Magyar and his Tisza party.For Context:Concerns about migration and climate policy reforms are believed to be the main drivers of the right-wing surge.
