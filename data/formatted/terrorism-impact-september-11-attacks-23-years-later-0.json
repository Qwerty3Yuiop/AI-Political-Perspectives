    "summary": "Wednesday is the 23rd anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, drawing varied media coverage across the spectrum.Lessons Learned:The New York Post Editorial Board (Right bias)published an opinion in which it claimed \u201cthe terrorists have never ended their war on us,\u201d and that American leaders risk \u201cfalling back into the complacency\u201d that led to September 11. The Board cited the White House\u2019s appeasement of \u201cterror-funding Iran\u201d, China\u2019s cyberwarfare efforts, Russia\u2019s \u201cprepping for war with NATO states,\u201d and the crisis on the southern border as looming threats that the Biden administration should do more to neutralize.\u2018Enemies of Humanity\u2019:Ameem Lutfi, writing forThe Hill (Center bias), argued that after September 11, \u201cAmerica went into overdrive in pursuit of terrorists\u2026 across multiple sovereign borders\u201d and \u201ccreated an ideological justification and martial technique for combating those deemed dangerous to its larger security and political interests.\u201d Lutfi wrote that many states are now adopting this attitude, which is \u201cplacing more lives at risk\u201d and contributing to the \u201ccontinued corrosion of the international rules-based order.\u201dSaudi Responsibility:CNN (Lean Left bias)penned a report on a yearslong legal battle between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and a coalition of September 11 survivors and victims' families who claim KSA was involved in backing the extremist groups that assisted the hijackers. The Saudi government denies the allegations, but the victims are currently waiting on a federal ruling that will decide if the case continues to move forward.",
