    "summary": "Queen Elizabeth II's deathsparked voluminous praise from voices across the world, with many remembering her as a model of service, duty, and dignity. Others used the moment torecall and criticize Britain's history of colonialism.The queen's death continues to be the top story from most major news sources, regardless of bias. Many voices, from world leaders to U.S. columnists across the political spectrum,fondly commemorated the queen's dignity and unprecedented reign. Praise for the queen seemed universal\u00a0from right-rated voices. Many opinions from\u00a0the left and center were also overwhelmingly positive, but not all.\u00a0Some columns from\u00a0left-rated outlets, such as aNew York Times Opinion (Left bias)guest essayfrom a Harvard history professor, voiced personal respect for the queen while also arguing that she \"helped obscure a bloody history\" of British decolonization \"whose proportions and legacies have yet to be adequately acknowledged.\"Some, includinga Carnegie Mellon professorand aTV host in Argentina, hadharsher words for the queen over her role in British colonialism; in a post that Twitter later removed, the professor wished for the queen's \"pain to be excruciating.\"\u00a0These criticisms were a focus of coverage from some right-rated outlets, which often framed them as being in bad taste.",
