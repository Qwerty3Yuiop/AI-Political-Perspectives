While AP referenced the Hezbollah affiliations of victims and Iran\u2019s support of the \u201cmilitant group,\u201d it painted the victims peacefully and detailed their home and family lives. It said the victims are \u201cstruggling to recover\u201d and Hezbollah is \u201cleft with the financial and psychological burden of thousands who need long-term medical treatment and recovery.\u201d AP noted official reports, including from the United Nations (UN), that questioned the legality of the attack pertaining to international law.
