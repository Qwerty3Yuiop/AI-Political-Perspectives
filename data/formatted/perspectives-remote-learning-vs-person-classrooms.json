    "summary": "As summer heats up, so does the debate surrounding remote learning and in-person classrooms.Johns Hopkins University estimatesthat 45.7% of Americans are fully vaccinated, while many states have dropped mask mandates and safety restrictions for the vaccinated or dropped mask mandates altogether. Several school districts inTexas,FloridaandNew Yorkhave decided to end remote learning altogether; elsewhere, schools will keeponlinelearning programsas options\u00a0for families who want to continue remote education.Some in favor of keeping a remote learning optionclaim online school leads to students\u00a0experiencing less racism.Others saythat remote learning\u00a0keeps students from black and brown communities safer from the virus, since they argue these students may have less access to the vaccines. Those in favor of in-person schooling point todata showing that many students fell behindin the year of remote learning; others point out that students in more remote or underserved areas lacked\u00a0access to the internet and technology needed for remote schooling. Some in the middle argue that the debate has become\u00a0politically charged; they point out that\u00a0different students have different learning behaviors and needs, and that both remote\u00a0and in-person learning can be beneficial in different situations.",
