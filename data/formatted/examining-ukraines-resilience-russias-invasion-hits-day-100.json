    "summary": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has reached its 100th day.Fighting continues across Ukraine, but the country has not fallen as someearlymedia coveragesuggested it might. Still, Russia continues to make slow progress in eastern Ukraine, specifically the Donbas region, to which itrecently shifted focus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy released avideoFriday,\u00a0saying, \"We have defended Ukraine for 100 days already. Victory will be ours. Glory to Ukraine.\" One day earlier, he detailed how \"about 20% of our territory\" is under Russian control and said that the \"Russian army has already destroyed almost the entire Donbas.\"Both sides have seen recent setbacks. Ukrainian forces began a retreat this week from Severodonetsk, the final Ukrainian holdout in Luhansk, one of two states that make up the Donbas region. And according to Russian state media,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putinrecently firedfive generals and one police colonel.Across the political spectrum, media outlets highlighted the invasion's 100th day, Zelenskyy's message, and the overall resilience of Ukraine and its people. Predictions for the conflict's future were a bit different from left to right. Some coverage fromCNN (Left bias)andAssociated Press (Center bias)focused more on Russia's strategic gains, and framed Putin as unlikely to concede despite his invasion purportedly not going as planned. Conversely,coverage from Fox News (Right bias)and other right-rated sources highlighted agraphicfrom the U.K. Ministry of Defense that labeled Russia's\u00a0offensive in\u00a0northern Ukraine \"a costly failure.\"",
