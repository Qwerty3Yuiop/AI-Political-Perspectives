    "summary": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she\u00a0would establish a select committee to investigate the January 6th Capitol riot, four weeks afterSenate Republicans blocked the creation of an independent bipartisan commission. \u201cThe select committee will investigate and report on the facts and the causes of the attack and it will report recommendations for the prevention of any future attack,\u201d Pelosi said. Following reports that Pelosi was considering a select committee, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that he was sure the committee would be political \u201cbecause that's the whole way that she's handled it.\u201dCoverage on all sides varied on saying whether Pelosi herself, House Democrats or the House of Representatives\u00a0would create the committee. Some coverage on all sides also compared this select committee to the committee created by Republicans in 2014 to investigate the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.",
