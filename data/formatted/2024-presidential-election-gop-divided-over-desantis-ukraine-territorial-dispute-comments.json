DeSantis stated that \u201cbecoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia\u201d was not a vital national interest for the United States.Criticism From the Right:The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board argued DeSantis was trying to appeal to Donald Trump\u2019s base, warning that \u201cthe Governor may want to consider that the political risks on foreign policy aren\u2019t only from the Trumpian right.\u201d The article referenced DeSantis\u2019 past statements in support of Ukraine to warn the potential 2024 candidate, stating, \u201cthis could become less a policy issue than a matter of character. What does Ron DeSantis believe, anyway?\u201dSupport From the Right:An opinion article published in Townhall supported DeSantis\u2019 words, arguing that DeSantis \u201crefuses to be dragged along into cheerleading yet another massive foreign policy failure.\u201d The writer stated that DeSantis will be \u201cvindicated by the time he wins the nomination,\u201d at which point the writer believes Americans will sour on Ukraine, stating, \u201cAmericans are not pacifists, but they are sick of failure, and that\u2019s what Ukraine is looking to become.\u201dCriticism From the Left:The Washington Post Editorial Board argued DeSantis\u2019 words \u201cbetrays the hollowness of his rhetoric about fighting for \u2018freedom\u2019 by turning his back on the most inspiring freedom fighters in the world today.\u201d",
