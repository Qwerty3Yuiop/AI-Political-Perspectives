    "summary": "This is the first school year since the Supreme Court ruled thataffirmative action is unconstitutional. Admissions data shows some, but not all,\u00a0colleges and universities enrolled fewer black students.The Details: Harvardreleasedits\u00a0application data on Wednesday, which showed that the percent of students who identify as black\u00a0had\u00a0dropped from 18% last year to 14% for its Class of 2028. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) experienced asharper dropin racial diversity, with black, Latino, Native\u00a0American, and Pacific Islander students declining from a 25% average in recent years to 16% for the incoming class.\u00a0Yale's data showed adifferent picture, with black enrollment steady, white enrollment increasing, and Asian enrollment declining. AreportfromVox (Left bias)said the impact of the court decision was similarly \"muted\" at many other schools. Meanwhile, some historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) sawincreases in applicationsfor this year.For Context: In June 2023,the Supreme Court ruledthat\u00a0admissions policies which consider race\u00a0violate the14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.How the Media Covered It: Vox wrote that \"so far, there isn't much good news in the data for students of color.\"\u00a0On the other hand,Breitbart (Right)called the decline in black enrollment at Harvard \"slight.\" TheWashington Free Beacon (Right)took a more negative tone toward schools, attributing\u00a0the mixed impacts of the new legal precedent to school administrators who had \"plotted ways to circumvent\" it.",
