    "summary": "On Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced in aNew York Times\u00a0opinion (Left bias) piecethat he would provide Ukraine\u00a0with \"more advanced rockets systems and munitions\" as part of a $700 million weapons package to help the country defend againstRussia's invasion.This is the 4th major weapons portion\u00a0and 11th aid package the U.S. has approved for Ukraine since the invasion started, the\u00a0most recent being the$40 billion package passed by the Senate on May 19th.\u00a0 It will include helicopters, tactical vehicles, Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger antiaircraft missiles, and other advanced weapons.\u00a0 White House officials said\u00a0specifically that the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or\u00a0HIMARS, is part of this package, which fire rockets with a maximum range of 50 miles.The package does not include longer-range munitions for those rocket systems, which are known as\u00a0ATACMS and have a maximum range of 186 miles. Biden had told reporters this week that the U.S. won't \"send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia.\"Coverage was widespread, and many sources cited the fact that medium-range rockets could in fact\u00a0reach Russia if fired near its border with Ukraine.\u00a0Ukraine has promised not to fire rockets into Russia, but instead use the\u00a0weapons to fight Russian forces within Ukraine.",
