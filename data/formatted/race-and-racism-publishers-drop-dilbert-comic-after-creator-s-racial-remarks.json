    "summary": "Many publications have dropped the nationally syndicated comic Dilbert\u00a0after its creator Scott Adams described 47% of polled Black Americans as a \u201chate group.\"The Details:In an episode of his podcast earlier this week, Scott Adamsdiscussed a recent Rasmussen Pollthat found only 53% of Black Americans think \u201cit\u2019s OK to be white.\" Adams said he\u2019s \u201cgoing to back off from being helpful to Black America, because it doesn\u2019t seem like it pays off.\u201d\u00a0Adams offered advice that \u201cwhite people (should) get the hell away from black people.\u201d\u00a0As a result of Adams\u2019 comments, many notable publications includingWashington Post (Lean Left),LA Times (Lean Left), andUSA Today (Lean Left)have dropped the long-running comic.For Context:Dilbert has been running since 1989 and is known for its satirization of corporate and white-collar America. Adams, whohas not shied away from racial discussion in the past, said the only outcome of his lifelong efforts to help Black Americans has been receiving the label \u201cracist.\u201d\u00a0The same Pollfoundthat 79% of Americans think black people can be racist too, while 12% disagree.How The Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum reported Adams\u2019 comments and ensuing cancelations of Dilbert similarly. The Epoch Times reported more in-depth on Adams\u2019 comments since the uproar began, while most other publications offered briefer synopses.",
