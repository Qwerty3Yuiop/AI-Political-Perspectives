    "summary": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Tuesday that the upcoming 2022 elections should \"be a referendum on the performance of the current administration, not a rehash of suggestions about what may have happened in 2020.\" McConnell argued that \"we need to be talking about the future and not the past,\" and said \"the American people are focusing on this administration and what it\u2019s doing to the country.\" Former President Donald Trump has claimed without evidence that the 2020 presidential election was rigged in favor of President Joe Biden. McConnell, while voting against Trump's impeachment in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, has condemned his claims of widespread election fraud.There was limited coverage of McConnell's comments as of Tuesday evening. Some reports from center- and\u00a0left-rated outlets cast doubt on McConnell's vision and cited examples of how Trump is retaining relevance among his supporters.",
