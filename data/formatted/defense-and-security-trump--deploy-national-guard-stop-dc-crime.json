I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor, and worse. This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back.\"For Context:Trumpdirected homeless peoplein D.C. to move out \u201cimmediately\u201d on Sunday, and his administration said it would consider deploying the National Guard to the Capitol or taking full federal control last week. About 900 FBI agents have recently been reassigned to assist with immigration enforcement and reform. Trump\u2019s \u201cMaking the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\u201d executive order from March states, \u201cAs the capital city of the greatest Nation in the history of the world, [D.C.] should showcase beautiful, clean, and safe public spaces.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:News media across the political spectrum credited The Washington Post with the initial FBI report but were otherwise vague about sources prior to Trump's announcement.The New York Times (Lean Left bias)was critical of FBI reassignments, stating, \u201cIt can be challenging for FBI agents to make meaningful contributions to such assignments, given that the bureau\u2019s agents are investigators not trained in patrol-focused policing.\u201dThe Hill (Center)said Trump is \u201cthreatening to federalize the District of Columbia\u201d but also quoted positive remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.
