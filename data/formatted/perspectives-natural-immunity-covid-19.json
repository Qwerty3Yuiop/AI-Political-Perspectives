    "summary": "The subject of natural immunity from COVID-19 is coming up more amid debates about the coronavirus vaccine, vaccine mandates and the spread of the Delta variant. According tomultiplestudies, people who survived COVID-19 are significantly less susceptible to reinfection; however, the length of immunity is unknown and likely differs from person to person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said recently thatpeople who previously had COVID-19 but haven't been vaccinatedare more than twice as likely to be reinfected than a fully vaccinated person.There are conflicting expert opinions on natural immunity. Some health professionals cited natural immunity as a reason not to mandate vaccines, arguing that young people are highly unlikely to die from COVID-19; some also saidfocusing on mandates can damage trust in public health and the human body's ability to fight disease. Other experts said\u00a0that because the timeline for immunity is unknown and because\u00a0new and more dangerous COVID-19 variants could develop, natural immunity is less useful andherd immunityis unachievable.",
