    "summary": "Bipartisan infrastructure negotiations between the White House and a group of Senate Republicans fell apart Tuesday. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who'd been leading negotiations with President Joe Biden, said the president ended the negotiations on a Tuesday phone call. Biden hadrecently dropped his infrastructure proposal's price tag from $2.25 trillion to $1\u00a0trillion, and\u00a0theSenate GOP's most recent counteroffer totaled $928 billion; however, the two sides remained too far apart on how to fund the bill and where the majority of the money should be directed. The White House will reportedly now focus on negotiating with a different, bipartisan group of senators.The news was featured atop the homepages of many major news sites across the spectrum Tuesday evening. Some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on funding for non-infrastructure projects included\u00a0in Biden's proposal, such as climate change and social justice initiatives. Some reports from left-rated source highlighted how Republican infrastructure counteroffers were always significantly smaller than what the Biden administration was advancing.",
