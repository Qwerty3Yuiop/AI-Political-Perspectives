    "summary": "Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenageracquitted of murder charges after killing two peopleduring a chaotic night of racial unrest, says he plans to sue media outlets and celebrities who've lied about him.This week, Rittenhouse announced\u00a0The Media Accountability Project, a new effort to \"to help fundraise and hold the media accountable\" for alleged lies about him.\u00a0Rittenhouse hasn't named any specific media outlets he plans to sue. He did\u00a0say he plans to sue\u00a0Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur, TV personality Whoopi Goldberg and basketball star LeBron James, who he\u00a0accuses of calling\u00a0him a murderer despite his acquittal on homicide charges. \"I don\u2019t want to see anybody else have to deal with what I went through. So, I want to hold them accountable for what they did to me,\" Rittenhouse said whileannouncing the effortin an interview withFox News' Tucker Carlson (Right bias).The story was a top headline from many right-rated outlets this week; fewer left- and center-rated sources covered it. Some reports from the left focused on how Rittenhouse killed people; highlighted how the political right has embraced him; and framed his trial as controversial. Conversely, right-rated sources often highlighted the jury's conclusion that the killings were self-defense, and focused onmedia bias during the Rittenhouse trialand examples of Goldberg and others calling him a murderer. Reports from the right also often framed the announcement as part of a broader reckoning for biased news outlets.",
