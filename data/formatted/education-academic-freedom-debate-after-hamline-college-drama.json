    "summary": "Controversy surrounding an art history professor displaying a painting of the Islamic prophet Muhammad raises\u00a0questions about academic freedom and cultural respect.For Context:At Hamline University in Minnesota, a professor\u2019s contract was not renewed after they showed a painting of Muhammad in an art history class, which led a Muslim student to complain. Hamline University President Fayneese Millerdefended the college\u2019s actionsin a letter, stating, \u201cfueled by commentary not well-informed on the particulars of this situation, we now find ourselves at the heart of a purported standoff between academic freedom and equity.\u201d Visually depicting Muhammad is typically avoided in Muslim culture.Writers across the spectrum agreed that the professor shouldn't be fired. One right-rated writer said that \"if you don\u2019t want your traditions, beliefs, or views challenged, then don\u2019t come to a university.\" A writer in theAmerican Spectator (Right Bias)concluded that \u201cto limit free speechin order to avoid offending Muslims is, quite simply, to replace American constitutional liberty with a concept of freedom rooted in sharia.\u201dA piece in MSNBC also ridiculed the college\u2019s actions, but criticized\u00a0narratives from right-rated writers claiming the college gave into the \u201cwoke mob,\u201d determining that \u201cas often happens with academic dust-ups, it doesn\u2019t track along a neat left/right axis.\u201d The writer compared the incident to calls for religious freedom in schools from the Christian right, determining, \u201ccouldn\u2019t our Christian Right get behind more respect for Religious Authority in the classroom by that same logic?\u201d",
