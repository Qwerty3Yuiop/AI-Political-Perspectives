    "summary": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday reached a party-line 11-11 vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court.Jackson\u2019s confirmation is still expectedlater this week, however. While the Judiciary Committee will not formally recommend her nomination, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called a vote to discharge Jackson\u2019s nomination from the committee. Because Republicans altered Senate rules in 2017 to overcomeDemocratic opposition to Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, they cannot use the filibuster to stop the narrow Democratic majority\u00a0from confirming Jackson. Republican Sens. Susan Collins,Lisa MurkowskiandMitt Romneyhave also said they would support Jackson's nomination.Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee again argued Monday that Jackson\u2019ssentences in child sex abuse caseswere lenient, and Democratscontinued to praise Jackson\u2019s record.Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Monday. Most reports noted that Jackson\u2019s nomination was likely. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed Senate Republicans as unusually or\u00a0baselessly obstructionist; The New York Times (Lean Left) said Republicans \u201ccontinued to rail against her on a variety of fronts, even as some prominent conservatives called their criticisms baseless.\u201d Some right-rated outlets highlighteda letter opposing Jackson\u2019s nominationsigned by 10 Republican state Attorneys General.",
