And I apologize,\" Abrams said in the CNN interview.\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u00a0director Rochelle Walensky\u00a0said\u00a0this week thatmask mandates are necessary\"essentially everywhere in the country in public indoor settings.\"Abrams received criticism from conservative critics\u00a0who oppose mask mandates in schools and saw the photo as an example of hypocrisy from Democrats who support mask mandates.
