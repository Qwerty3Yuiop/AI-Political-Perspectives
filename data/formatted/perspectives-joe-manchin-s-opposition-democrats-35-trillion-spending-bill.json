    "summary": "On Sunday, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin reassertedhis opposition to spending $3.5 trillionover ten years onDemocrats\u2019 budget reconciliation bill, instead suggesting a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion figure. \u201cIt's not going to be at 3.5, I can assure you. But, with that, whatever it is, once you have a competitive tax code that you can compete globally, and then you should look at what the need is,\u201dManchin told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. With a narrow majority and unanimous opposition from Senate Republicans, Democrats need Manchin\u2019s vote to pass their bill. On Sunday, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said Manchin\u2019s position was \u201cabsolutely not acceptable,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is a consequential bill. It is hard to put a bill like this together. At the end of the day I believe we will.\u201dVoices in left-rated outlets were more common on Monday and tended to express frustration with Manchin. Voices right-rated outlets tended to praise Manchin\u2019s opposition to Democrats\u2019 spending plans, calling on other Democrats to block the bill.",
