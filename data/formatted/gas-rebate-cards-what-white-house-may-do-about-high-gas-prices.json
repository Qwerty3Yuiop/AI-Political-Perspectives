    "headline": "Gas Rebate Cards What White House May Do About High Gas Prices",
    "summary": "As gas prices remain high and U.S. consumers stay frustrated, the White House is considering new responses.Reports from the Washington Post and Fox News this week both cited anonymous White House officials who said\u00a0that the administration is considering distributing\u00a0gas rebate cards after initially ruling out the idea. It's unclear who would qualify for the potential rebate or how the cards would be limited to gas purchases only. Also this week, President Joe Biden sent a letter to U.S. oil companies calling on them to \"take immediate actions\" to increase\u00a0supply\u00a0and saying he's prepared to use \"emergency authorities to increase refinery capacity and output in the near term.\"The national average\u00a0price of regular gasoline\u00a0rose 10 cents last week to a record high of$5.01 per gallon. If adjusting for inflation historically, gas prices were at their highest in 2008 \u2014 today's average wouldneed to hit $5.33to surpass that point.Coverage across the political spectrum highlighted Biden's letter to oil companies and the reports about potential rebate cards. Many on the right have consistently criticized Biden's stance on the U.S. oil industry; some nowcall\u00a0him a hypocritefor encouraging production while also purportedly making it harder for refineries to produce oil and make money. Coverage from the left often focuses more onhow global factors, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine and international oil markets, are affecting gas prices in the U.S. andaround the world.",
