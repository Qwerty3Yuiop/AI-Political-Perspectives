    "summary": "Last week\u2019sreport from Special Counsel Robert Hurrenewed debate regarding President Joe Biden\u2019s age and ability to win reelection and lead the country for an additional four years.From the Left:David Rothkopf (Lean Left bias)wrote that Democrats need a \u201creality check.\u201d Instead of denying Biden\u2019s advanced age, Rothkopf calls for Biden\u2019s team to \u201cown it,\u201d writing, \u201cLet\u2019s see more of him not in staged settings, but in the kind of informal, unstaged videos that matter most today on Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok.\u201d A writer inVox (Left bias)outlined the process of replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee, determining it to be a \u201cherculean, if not impossible, task\u201d and concluding, \u201cIf you\u2019re a Democrat, or want to beat Donald Trump, it looks like it\u2019s Biden or bust.\u201dFrom the Right:Charles C. W. Cooke (Right bias)argued that there is \u201cno chance that the Democrats will be able to get around Joe Biden\u2019s obvious decline.\u201d Outlining why the Democrat\u2019s current strategy won\u2019t work moving forward, Cooke concluded, \u201cPresident Biden cannot fake being competent because the people who are ultimately empowered to judge his competence have no great obligation to pretend that they cannot see the truth.\u201d A writer in theWashington Examiner (Lean Right bias)echoed concerns, writing, \u201cNone of us gets out of here alive, and 81-year-old Biden is not going to level out onto a plateau of acceptable lucidity. He is going to step down again and again until he reaches the cellar door.\u201d",
