    "summary": "Civilians in Ukraine began evacuating besieged areas along \"safe corridors\" Tuesday, as the refugee count hit 2 million amid Russia's ongoing attacks.Russia and Ukraine agreed to a cease-fire Tuesday in the northeastern\u00a0city of Sumy to allow civilians to evacuate safely, the first such agreement since Russia's invasion began nearly two weeks ago. Efforts to establish cease-fires and humanitarian evacuation routesfailed in other places such as the southern city of Mariupol, where Russian missile attacks reportedly resumed as evacuations were starting on Monday.\u00a0Russia had previously offered to allow civilians to evacuate on designated routes leading to Russia or its close ally Belarus, a proposal that Ukraine rejected. The U.N.'s human rights office said\u00a0it's recorded more than 400 civilian deaths in Ukraine since the invasion began, and warned that the true number is likely higher. Athird round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraineended Monday with no major developments.The safe corridors and refugee crisis are a top story across the political spectrum, especially for left- and center-rated sources, with many focused on the plight of fleeing civilians. Some more sensationalist sources, such asInsider (Lean Left)andNew York Post (Lean Right), highlighted reports that Russians linedsome safe corridors\u00a0with land mines.",
