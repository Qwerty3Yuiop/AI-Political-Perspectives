    "summary": "The White House is disagreeing\u00a0with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that the United States is withholding weapons from Israel and is hampering the Israeli military's ongoing offensive in Gaza.Key Details: According toAxios(Lean Left bias) and several Hebrew media outlets, high-level talks\u00a0in Washington, D.C., werecancelledafter Netanyahu posted avideo\u00a0statementclaiming the U.S. was withholding arms shipments.\u00a0The\u00a0White House denies these reports. While Axios cited two White House officials claiming the meeting was canceled, it also cited a third official who said the meeting was \"postponed rather than canceled, due to a scheduling issue.\" TheWashington Examiner (Lean Right bias)alsoreportedthat the meeting was postponed because of scheduling issues, citing a White House official. Meanwhile,\u00a0Netanyahu prepares to address Congress on July 24 \u2014\u00a0an address that many Democrats plan to boycott.Key Quotes:\u00a0\"It's inconceivable that in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,\" Netanyahu said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said,\u00a0\"We genuinely do not know what he is talking about. We just don't,\"\u00a0adding that only\u00a0one shipment of heavy bombs had been paused\u00a0since the war began.For Context: A shipment of 3,500 bombs wasput on holdin May due to\u00a0U.S. concerns over an imminent\u00a0Israeli ground operation in Rafah. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his last meeting in Israel, reassured Netanyahu\u00a0that the U.S. was working to remove bottlenecks in arms deliveries.How the Media Covered it: Some sources on the left noted that Netanyahu's remarks were one of his harshest public criticisms of the Biden Administration since theOctober 7 attackon Israel by Hamas.
