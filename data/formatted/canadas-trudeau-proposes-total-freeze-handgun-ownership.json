    "summary": "On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced\u00a0that his government is introducing legislation that would freeze handgun ownership\u00a0throughout the country.The bill, which was presented to\u00a0the Canadian parliament on Monday, would not ban handgun ownership outright, but would make it illegal to buy, sell, transfer or import them anywhere in Canada. Trudeau stated that \"there is no reason\u00a0Canadians need\u00a0guns in their everyday lives,\" except for firearms for hunting or fishing.If the bill passes, there will be a buyback program for \"assault-style weapons\" later this year.\u00a0 There will also be new red flag laws to remove guns and suspend licenses for individuals who pose\u00a0a threat to themselves or others, as well as increased penalties for firearm crimes. The announcement in Canada comes in the wake of two large mass shootings in the United States \u2014\u00a0an elementary school attack inUvalde, Texason May\u00a024th, and a racially-motivated shooting\u00a0inBuffalo, New Yorkon May 14th.The proposed legislation was a top story from news outlets across the political spectrum Tuesday. Reports from left-rated sources tended to focus more on Canadian statistics that suggest handguns are used more\u00a0often than other weapons in violent crimes in the country.",
