    "summary": "The former chief marketing officer of Levi Strauss & Co. says she was forced to leave the company due to her support for keeping schools open during the COVID-19 pandemic.Writing on the Substack publishing platform of former New York Times editor Bari Weiss, Jennifer Seyalleged that other Levi's executives pushed her to stop speaking outabout the need for schools to remain open during the pandemic. Sey also said she\u00a0walked away from a $1 million exit package offering, which would usually include a nondisclosure agreement. Levi's denies making such an\u00a0offer. \"In the end, no one stood with me,\" Sey said of her former colleagues. \"Not one person publicly said they agreed with me, or even that they didn\u2019t agree with me.\"Right-rated sourcescovered the story more, with many highlighting it as an example of woke censorship and cancel culture costing someone their career. Left- and center-rated sources described Sey as having quit or resigned; right-rated outlets focused more on her claim that she was forced to leave. CBS News described Sey's situation as \"the latest example of corporations caught in the crosshairs of opposing views on COVID-related policies.\" NPR said the story \"prompted big questions about corporations and speech.\" The Daily Wire said Sey's story \"revealed what appeared to be a double-standard at the clothing company\" because other employees weren't accosted for speaking out about former President Donald Trump, Black Lives Matter and other social justice issues.",
