    "summary": "Top U.S. military leaders defended the withdrawal from Afghanistan in a Congressional hearing Tuesday morning.\u00a0Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, the nation's top military officer, is appearing before the\u00a0Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday and the House\u00a0Armed Services Committee Wednesday, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and U.S. Central Command Gen. Kenneth McKenzie. All three recommended that 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, which contradicts previous statements from\u00a0President Joe Biden.\u00a0During Tuesday's hearing, Milley alsodefended two calls he made to China's top generalduring the Trump\u00a0administration amid recent reports\u00a0that heacted to limit Trump's nuclear powersand wanted to quell Chinese concerns about a potential U.S. attack.The testimonies made headlines across the spectrum Tuesday morning. Coverage across the spectrum, especially from right-rated sources, framed the withdrawal as botched and harsh questioning of military leaders as necessary. Some right-rated outlets highlighted the possible disconnect between the Pentagon and top Biden administration leaders, and how miscommunication and hastiness on the part of\u00a0Biden\u00a0may have made the Afghanistan pullout worse. Some left-rated sources highlighted how Milley will face questions on Trump; a headline from CNN (Left bias)saidMilley's testimony may \"put Trump's political storms on full display.\"Updated 5:54 p.m. on 9/28/21",
