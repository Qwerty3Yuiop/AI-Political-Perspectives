    "summary": "Originally published in 2023.This Christmas, voices across the political spectrum shared thoughts on what it means to celebrate the holiday.\"Christianity\u2019s Democratizing Power\":E.J. Dionne (Left bias), a writer forThe Washington Post (Lean Left), issued\u00a0\"a call for celebrating Christmas as a reminder of how much religious and secular people have to teach each other.\" Dionne detailed the \"democratizing power\" of the story of Jesus Christ, and said we \"should be grateful for the fruitfulness of dialogue between secular advocates of freedom and religious thinkers who understood the arc of their tradition as bending toward the equal dignity of every person.\"\"Sporadic Acts of Kindness\":A writer forNewsmax (Right)said Christmas \"calls for tangible action, compassion and service,\" and that it's \"critical that we identify and engage in practical ways to uplift those in need. While Americans generously dedicate their time to food banks and meal drives during the Christmas season, the challenge lies in transforming sporadic acts of kindness into sustained efforts throughout the entire year.\"\"Take Refuge in Church\":\"In a season now marked by excess and decadence, there\u2019s value in leaning in to a quieter, more intentional vision of the holidays,\"\u00a0said a writer forChristianity Today (Center bias). \"Returning to the older pattern of holidays as holy days\u2014marked chiefly with special church services\u2014is especially poignant this year, amid news of the cancellation of Christmas festivities in Bethlehem due to the Israel-Hamas war. Christmas will still come, even without its more superficial celebrations, and tragedy can unmask our shallower concerns and draw believers back to worship in the most difficult times.\"",
