    "summary": "When asked about the safety of gas-powered stoves this month, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commissioner said that \"Products that can\u2019t be made safe can be banned.\" What might that mean for your kitchen?For Context:A recentstudysuggests that 12.7% of childhood asthma in the U.S. is attributed to gas stove use. CPSC's chairman clarified after the commissioner's comments, saying that \"Research indicates that emissions from gas stoves can be hazardous, and the CPSC is looking for ways to reduce related indoor air quality hazards. But to be clear, I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the CPSC has no proceeding to do so.\"Possible Bans?:\"The president does not support banning gas stoves,\" the White House press secretary\u00a0said earlier this month. But some areas do. California cities like\u00a0San Francisco and Berkeley\u00a0have implemented bans on natural gas appliances in recent years, and New York\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) recently announced a proposal to\u00a0make New York the first state to ban gas heaters and appliances in all new buildings.\u00a0Washington state also passed a law last year banning gas appliances in commercial construction and some residential buildings.How the Media Covered It:Some right-rated media\u00a0framed the idea as an\u00a0environmental effort by activists and the Biden administration that would inconvenience consumers in the name of eliminating fossil fuels. Left-rated sources focused more on the negative effects of gas and the environmental advantages of using alternatives.",
