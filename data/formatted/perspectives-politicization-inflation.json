    "summary": "Amidrising consumer pricesand debates over large federal spending bills, the government's role in fueling or relieving Americans'\u00a0economic burdens is a subject of debate. Many Republicans say current Democratic policies and high-cost spending bills will make current inflation worsen in coming years, hurting consumers, workers and families. The Federal Reserve maintains that current inflation will only be temporary, a stance that President Joe Biden and other prominent Democrats have echoed while advocating for spending packages they say will better the lives of average Americans.Right-rated voices have covered inflation fears more prominently,\u00a0with some accusing Democrats of dismissing inflation fears while supporting harmful economic policy. Left- and center-rated voices have been less accusatory, often exploring the likelihood of inflation worsening and\u00a0financially-sustainable legislation being agreed upon in Congress.\u00a0Some financial news outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal,published some reportsthat suggest inflation will be temporary, and others addressing how it may still cause significant short-term issues; others, such as CNBC (Center bias),highlighted voiceswho accused the Federal Reserve of being overly\u00a0optimistic\u00a0about inflation only being\u00a0temporary.",
