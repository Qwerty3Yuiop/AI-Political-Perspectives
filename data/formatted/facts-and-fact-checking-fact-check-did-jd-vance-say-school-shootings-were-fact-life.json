    "summary": "A headline from theAssociated Press (Lean Left bias)quoted Sen. J.D. Vance as calling school shootings a \"fact of life.\" After X userspointed outthat Vance was actually \"lamenting\" the fact, the AP added the word toits headline.The Quote:Responding to a recentschool shooting at Apalachee High School,\u00a0J.D. Vance said to supporters in Arizona,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t like that this is a fact of life. But if you are a psycho and you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets... We\u2019ve got to bolster security so if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children they\u2019re not able.\u201dThe Controversy:The original AP headline omitted the context that J.D. Vance said he did not like that shootings were a fact of life. The omission implies that Vance was dismissive of the violence, however some argue that is a mischaracterization.\u00a0Including \"laments\" in the new headline captures Vance's sentiment about the frequency of shootings.The Effect:Many outlets republish the AP's content, and search engines can be slow to update. At the time of writing, AllSides found that the homepages of search engines like Google and Bing still featured the old headline from several outlets. While outlets on the right were more likely to highlight criticism of the AP,The Telegraph (Lean Right bias)features asimilar headlineto the AP: \"School shootings are just a fact of life, says JD Vance.\"",
