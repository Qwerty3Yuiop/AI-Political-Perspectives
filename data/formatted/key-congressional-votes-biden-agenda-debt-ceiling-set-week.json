    "headline": "Key Congressional Votes Biden Agenda Debt Ceiling Set Week",
    "summary": "Two Congressional votes set for this week are key for the Biden administration's spending plans. A House vote on the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package is set for Thursday, and a\u00a0Senate vote is set for Monday to suspend the debt ceiling and avoid a government shutdown.\u00a0Republicans are expected to vote down the debt ceiling measure, leaving Democrats to figure out how to keep the government funded while also passing trillions of dollars worth of spending bills. Work continues on crafting and securing votes for the administration's $3.5 trillion budget bill.Many sources focused on the pricetags for the legislation and the political maneuvering needed from Democrats to advance the bills. Sources across the spectrum framed the coming days as pivotal for the Biden administration and the president's agenda; many on all sides also painted smooth passage of the bills as unlikely based on lack of support from moderate Democrats. Some coverage also highlighted how the legislation, if passed, will have vast implications for American life.",
