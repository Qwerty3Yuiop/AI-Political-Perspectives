    "summary": "President Joe BidenpledgedFriday to safely evacuate all American citizens and Afghan allies\u00a0fleeing the Taliban. \u201cLet me be clear, any American who wants to come home, we will get you home,\" Biden said.\u00a0Biden also acknowledged that \u201cthis evacuation mission is dangerous,\u201d adding, \u201cI cannot promise what the final outcome will be, or\u2026 that it will be without risk of loss.\u201d Responding to questions from reporters, Biden also said he had seen \u201cno question of our credibility\u201d from American allies and claimed that al Qaeda was \u201cgone\u201d from Afghanistan. However, Defense Department Press Secretary John Kirby later told reporters that al Qaeda and ISIS were \u201ca presence\u201d in the country and declined to provide exact figures.Most coverage from across the spectrum focused on Biden\u2019s commitment to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies. Some coverage in right-rated outlets focused on Kirby contradicting Biden\u2019s al Qaeda claim. In quoting Biden\u2019s \u201cfinal outcome\u201d statement,Fox Newsincluded Biden misspeaking, potentially contributing to anarrative in right-rated outletsthat questions Biden\u2019s mental fitness: \u201cwhat the final outcome will be, or what it will be that it will be without risk of loss.\u201d Other outlets tended to omit the misspoken words or replace them with an ellipsis.",
