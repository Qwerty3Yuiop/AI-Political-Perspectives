The findings were released as part of the committee's efforts to obtain critical emails from\u00a0John Eastman, an attorney who was involved in Trump's strategy topersuade Pence to refuse to certify the Electoral College results.\u00a0 Eastman so far has claimed attorney-client privilege.A judge overseeing the civil lawsuit would review the emails to decide if they should stay protected, since the House cannot bring criminal charges.\u00a0 The committee will, however, consider passing along any evidence of criminal conduct by Trump or his campaign team to the U.S. Justice Department.\u00a0 This symbolic criminal referral would increase political pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge the former president.",
