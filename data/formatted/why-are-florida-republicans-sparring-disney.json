    "summary": "Led by Florida governor Ron DeSantis, Republicans in the Sunshine State and elsewhere are taking a stand against Disney. Why?On Thursday, the\u00a0Florida legislaturepassed and sent to the governor's deska bill that would dissolve Disney\u2019s special improvement district in Florida, which allows Disney to control its own zoning and shields it from some state regulations. Disney has been the recent subject of criticism fromboth sides of the culture war: some on the right say Disney is indoctrinating children withfar-left ideologies, and some on the left say Disney fails to stand up for LGBTQ+ rights and representation.Recently-leaked videos of Disney executivesadvocating for significantly more LGBTQ+ representation in Disney content sparked debate about LGBTQ+ issues and entertainment for kids, particularly in the context of Florida's newParental Rights in Education billand thedebate over LGBTQ+ topics being taught in schools.Coverage from some right rated news sourcesframes Disney and its contentas being compromised by progressive political agendas. Coverage from some left-rated outlets paints those types of criticisms as extreme, exaggerated and rooted in anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments. One Washington Post writer accused DeSantis of taking on Disney to\u00a0\"bolster his credibility with a GOP base itching for culture war victory.\" One writer for National Review argued that Republicans were righteous in their efforts to challenge Disney and other influential companies\u00a0that \"have seen their boardrooms seized by militant woke political activists.\"",
