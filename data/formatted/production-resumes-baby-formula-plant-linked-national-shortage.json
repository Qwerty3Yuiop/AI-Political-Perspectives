    "headline": "Production Resumes Baby Formula Plant Linked National Shortage",
    "summary": "Production of baby formula has restarted at Abbott Laboratories' manufacturing plant\u00a0in Sturgis, Michigan, after meeting initial government sanitary requirements.The plant has been closed since February after complaints of illnesses in infants who consumed several brands of powdered formula\u00a0manufactured there, two\u00a0of whom\u00a0later died. Abbott has denied that the plant was responsible for the illnesses, saying the bacteria found in the plant did not match the samples from the ill infants. The plant's closure has been linked by reports across the political spectrum to a subsequent nationwide shortage of baby formula.Abbott will first produce EleCare and other metabolic and specialty formulas that will be available to consumers as early as June 20. Production of Similac and other formulas will restart as soon as possible, according to Abbott.Coupled with global supply chain issues, the plant's closure led toacute shortages, and also to scrutiny of why the FDA took more than three months to clear Abbott to resume production.\u00a0 Parents have been left seeking supplies from friends, doctors, food banks, and social media. Last month, President Joe Biden ordered the Defense Department tofly in shipments of baby formula from overseas, and invoked theDefense Production Actto boost domestic production.",
