    "headline": "Healthcare Child Illness Surge Strains Hospitals Parents",
    "summary": "Hospitals and parents are being strained by an\u00a0outbreak of the child illness known as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in addition to seasonal flu cases and continued COVID-19 infections.Key Quotes: Parents are happily sending kids back to school while \"discounting influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, all the other pieces that fit to this respiratory illness puzzle,\"\u00a0said Jackie Follansbee, a school nurse in\u00a0Washington state.For Context: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data suggest that infants 6 months and younger arebeing hospitalized with RSVroughly\u00a0seven times more than they were pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, RSV has been one of the most common viruses found in children, but this year's outbreak has alarmed some\u00a0doctors enough for them to call on the Biden Administration to declare a national health emergency. That declaration\u00a0would provide more federal resources to combat the RSV surge, similar to those provided during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.How The Media Covered it: Right-rated sources focused more on how the Biden Administration hasn't declared\u00a0a national emergency. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus more on the challenges facing hospitals, parents, and sick children. Reports across the spectrum highlighted experts who suggested that COVID-19 lockdowns made children more susceptible to infections.",
