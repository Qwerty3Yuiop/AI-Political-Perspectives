    "headline": "Fauci Says Us Can Have Covid 19 Under Control Spring If Vaccinations Rise",
    "summary": "In an interview with CNN (Left bias) Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci predicted that the U.S. could \"get some good control\" of COVID-19 by next spring if vaccination\u00a0rates rise. Fauci said that \"If we keep lingering without getting those people vaccinated that should be vaccinated, this thing could linger on, leading to the development of another variant which could complicate things.\" Roughly 90 million eligible\u00a0Americans have not received the COVID-19 vaccine. Fauci added: \"\u201cI respect people\u2019s freedom, but when you\u2019re talking about a public health crisis that we\u2019ve been going through now for well over a year and a half, the time has come.\" Fauci also apologized for and corrected a prediction he made in an NPR interview Monday, in which he predicted better control of the pandemic \"into the fall and the winter\"\u00a0rather than Spring 2022.Fauci's interview was covered across the spectrum. Some left-rated sources framed his comments as a sign that defeating the pandemic\u00a0requires continued action from the federal government and public health officials, such as vaccine mandates; others covered how the predictionmay create issues for Biden and Democrats. Some right-rated outlets focused more on Fauci's correction, framing it as another example of inconsistent government messaging on COVID-19.",
