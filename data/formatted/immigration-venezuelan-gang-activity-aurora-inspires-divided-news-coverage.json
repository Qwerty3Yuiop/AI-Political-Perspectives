But asdetails emerged, suggesting\u00a0Aurora authorities and building managers had been aware of the gang's presence and activity for months, critical news coverage intensified.For Context: The properties'\u00a0owner, CBZ Management, had\u00a0ahistory of code violationsbefore the alleged gang activity began. Some residents maintain thatCBZ is primarily\u00a0to blamefor the derelict state of the properties. The Biden administration recentlysanctionedTren de Aragua for its criminal activity across the Americas.How the Media Covered It: Right-rated media emphasized the narrative of the gang \"taking over\" the properties, accusing local officials and law enforcement of inaction.
