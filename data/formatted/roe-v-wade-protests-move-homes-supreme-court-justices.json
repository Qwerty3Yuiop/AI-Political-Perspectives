    "summary": "Pro-choice protestsin the wake of theRoe v Wadeleakmoved to\u00a0the homes of three conservative Supreme Court justices in the past few days.Protesters gathered outside the homes of Justices Clarence Thomas and\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh over the weekend, and at Justice Samuel Alito's home on Monday. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the White House will \"continue to encourage\" peaceful protests, and criticized \"voices on the right who have called out these protests that are happening while remaining silent\" on protests at the homes of school board members or the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.Section 1507of the federal criminal code bans protesting at judge's homes with the intent of obstructing the administration of justice or influencing the decision. In a show of bipartisanship, a bill to grant extra security for the justices' families\u00a0unanimously passed the Senate Monday.New polling datafrom\u00a0Trafalgar Group suggests that over 75%\u00a0of\u00a0voters think protesting at the homes of\u00a0Supreme Court justices\u00a0is unacceptable.Sources across the spectrum highlighted the protests and the Senate vote. Many reports from the right\u00a0highlighted Section 1507 andPsaki's comments, and framed the Biden administration's response as weak and politicized. Some voices on all sides, especiallythe rightbut alsothe leftand center, condemned the protests as an illegal,\u00a0poor approach to the issue. Conversely, one writer for MSNBC argued that an \"increasingly mobilized population furious about being disenfranchised\" was justified in protesting at the homes of justices.",
