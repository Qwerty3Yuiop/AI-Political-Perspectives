    "headline": "Why Did 2 Prosecutors Resign Nycs Investigation Donald Trump",
    "summary": "Two of the prosecutors leading the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office probe\u00a0of former president Trump\u00a0resigned this week. Why?According to reports across the political spectrum, Mark Pomerantz and Carey R. Dunne quit the investigation after new D.A.\u00a0Alvin Bragg\u00a0suggested to them that he had doubts about continuing the case against Trump. The investigation\u00a0is focused on the Trump Organization's alleged practice of overvaluing certain real estate properties for loans and insurance purposes, but undervaluing the same\u00a0properties\u00a0for tax purposes. Last July, former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg wasindicted after N.Y. prosecutors hit the company with 15 counts of tax fraud and other crimes.Coverage from all sides indicates that the probe may be losing momentum. Left-rated sources often attributed\u00a0the resignations to the prosecutors' purported disagreements with Bragg and support for continuing the D.A.'s case. Some right-rated voices said the development was unsurprising, and framed the charges against Weisselberg and the accusations against Trump as weak.",
