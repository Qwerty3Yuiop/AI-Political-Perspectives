    "summary": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)reported Fridaythat\u00a0U.S. employment rose by 194,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped from 5.2% to 4.8%. Economists expected roughly 500,000 jobs added.\u00a0The BLS report highlighted \"notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in retail trade, and in transportation and warehousing,\" and also noted a decline in employment in public education. Average hourly earnings climbed\u00a019 cents to $30.85 in September. The workforce has gained 17.4 million jobs since a low in April 2020, but remains roughly 5 million below its pre-pandemic level.The September jobs report was covered prominently across the spectrum Friday. Many sources, regardless of bias, framed the news as a major disappointment, thoughone analysis from the New York Times (Lean Left bias)said the numbers reflect\u00a0a more rapid recovery than previous ones. Reports from left-rated sources often framed the disappointing numbers as a result of the continued COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Some left-rated voices juxtaposed the underwhelming job gains with the fact thatover 8 million people lost pandemic unemployment benefits in September.",
