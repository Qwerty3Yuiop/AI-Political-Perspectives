In announcing the operation, Putin called on Ukrainian troops to lay down their arms and maintained\u00a0that Russia didn't plan to occupy any Ukrainian territories, but threatened \"consequences that you have never experienced in your history\" for anyone who tries\u00a0to interfere.The news was the top story from most outlets across the political spectrum Thursday.\u00a0Reports about casualties are conflicting; Ukraine's defense ministry says no troops have been lost, but multiple reports across the spectrum say up to 40 people have been killed in the attacks.",
