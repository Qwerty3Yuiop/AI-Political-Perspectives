    "summary": "The death toll has continued to rise and hundreds are still missing in Europe after record rainfall produced some of the largest floods the continent has seen in centuries. Germany and Belgium were the main countries damaged by the floodwaters, while Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands also experienced heavy rainstorms over the past few days. Buildings were destroyed, cars were crushed and more than 100,000 homes were left without power. As the floodwaters recede, rescue crews have been deployed and are searching for survivors. Many European leaders have listed climate change as the cause of the extreme weather.Many left-leaning outlets highlighted the natural disaster\u2019s connection to climate change. Most right-leaning outlets did not highlight climate change in their reporting.",
