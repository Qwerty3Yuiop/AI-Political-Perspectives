    "summary": "AWashington Postreport published Tuesday revealed 866 pages of leading disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci's emails sent during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unveiled emails show Fauci's correspondence with business leaders, random strangers, colleagues and leaders from foreign governments, including George Gao, director of China's\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
