    "summary": "New York City willend\u00a0its private sector COVID-19 vaccine mandatestarting Nov. 1.Mayor Eric Adamsannouncedthe news Tuesday while receiving his second COVID-19 booster shot, and said that \"because we've been so successful\" with distributing vaccines,\u00a0\"it's time to move on to the next level of fortifying our city.\"\u00a0Adams also said that thevaccine mandate for public sector employees will remain in effect, and noted that \"Our vaccinated workforce kept the city open and operating.\" The announcement comes after\u00a0President Joe Bidensaidthatthe COVID-19 \"pandemic is over\"during an interview with 60 Minutes that aired Sunday. Roughly 1,700 city employees have been fired for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine since the mandate took effect last October. Earlier this month, New York City fired 850 teachers and aides\u00a0for failing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, bringing thetotal numberof NYC school employees fired over the mandate to\u00a01,950.News sources across the political spectrum covered the announcement, butoften framed it very differently. Many right-rated outlets highlighted the\u00a0hundreds of teachers fired over the mandate, and often framed that in the context of New York'songoing teacher shortage. Conversely, a report from the New York Daily News focused more on data showing the city's daily COVID-19 death rate, and highlighted how \"Despite the focus on the municipal mandate, only 1,761 city employees workers had gotten fired for refusing to get vaccinated as of Aug. 30.\"",
