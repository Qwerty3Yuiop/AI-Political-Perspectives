    "summary": "Saturday is Juneteenth, which marks the anniversary of when news of the Emancipation Proclamation finally reached the enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, on June 19th, 1865. President Joe Biden signed a law making it a federal holiday on Thursday, the first holiday added to the U.S. calendar since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983. Earlier this week, the Senatepassed that bill with unanimous support.Most of the opinions about Juneteenth this year were framed around the day becoming an official holiday. Opinions were more common from left- and center-rated outlets. Many left-rated voices celebrated the decision; many also called it a \"hollow victory\" and grouped it with other \"symbolic gestures that are presented as progress without any accompanying economic or structural change.\" Some right-rated voices\u00a0criticized that narrative and its proponents, arguing that \"there is no concession or show of good faith that will ever placate their ever-increasing litany of demands.\"",
