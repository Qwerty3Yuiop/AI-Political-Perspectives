    "headline": "Perspectives Bidens Handling Immigration Questioned Across Spectrum",
    "summary": "Amid controversy surrounding the since-disbanded migrant camp in Texas and Border Patrol's treatment of the migrants, as well as the continued influx of unauthorized migrants at the southern border, President Joe Biden's handling of immigration has attracted criticism from all sides of the spectrum.According to Customs and Border Protection, 208,887 people were\u00a0apprehended at the southern border in\u00a0August. 50,014 were apprehended there in all of 2020.Some on the left have criticized Biden for continuing to use Title 42 of the Public Health Services Act to expel migrants; the law, which former President Donald Trump invoked at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, allows federal health officials to take extra measures to limit the transmission of a disease during a pandemic. Left-rated voices have often expressed concern that Biden is too hard on immigration, and that his\u00a0willingness to deport asylum-seekers and opposition to more open borders too closely resemble Trump's immigration stance.Many right-rated voices have said Biden is too soft on immigration, arguing that he hasn't focused enough federal resources on curbing illegal immigration\u00a0at the southern border. Some also condemned him for his criticism of Border Patrol agents that was based onmisleading claims that\u00a0agents whipping Haitian migrants. Many on the right also highlighted a recent interview of former President Barack Obamain which he criticized\u00a0open borders.",
