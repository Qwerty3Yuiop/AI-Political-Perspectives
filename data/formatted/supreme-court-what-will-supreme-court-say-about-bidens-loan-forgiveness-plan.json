    "summary": "After two federal appeals courtsdenied bidsby the Biden administration to push its$400 billion student loan forgiveness planthrough multiple legal challenges, the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the plan in February.For Context:The court said it will hear oral arguments from both sides before issuing\u00a0a final ruling, likely\u00a0at the end of its current term in June.\u00a0Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0had alreadyturned downtwo requests to block the program entirely. In a short unsigned order\u00a0issued Thursday, the court declined to lift the appeals court\u2019s ruling but agreed to fast-track the case, per the\u00a0administration's request. Last week, President Joe Biden announced that the pause on federal student loan paymentswould again be extended, this time until June.Key Quotes:White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration welcomes \"the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear the case,\" and that the program is \"legal\" and \"supported by careful analysis from administration lawyers.\"How the Media Covered It:Sources across the spectrum seem to agree that it's unclear how the court will eventually rule on the program. Left-rated news sources often focused more on how the legal fight is affecting student loan borrowers; right-rated outlets tended to focus more on legal arguments against the plan. CNN said the administration was \"dealt another setback\" regarding the plan. A writer for The Federalist argued that oral arguments over the case \"seem likely to prove embarrassing to the Biden administration.\"",
