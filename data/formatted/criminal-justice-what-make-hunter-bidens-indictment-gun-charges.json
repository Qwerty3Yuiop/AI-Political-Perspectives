    "summary": "Hunter Biden\u00a0was indicted Thursday by Special Counsel David Weiss for allegedly lying about his drug addiction on a 2018 gun application. Are the charges lenient\u00a0or\u00a0harsh?An 'Unusual\u00a0Case':The Christian Science Monitor (Center bias)said \"prosecutors could face difficulties in bringing those charges to trial and convicting Mr. Biden,\" and focused on voices\u00a0who questioned \"whether other defendants in similar situations are charged with felonies and taken to courtroom trial, rather than [striking] plea deals or diversion agreements.\"A 'Sweetheart Deal':\"The charges vindicate critics of the Justice Department\u2019s earlier sweetheart plea deal,\" wroteThe Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board (Lean Right bias), suggesting Weiss\u00a0is going easy on\u00a0Biden and that his appointment as special counsel was to \"suggest the appearance of independence.\"\u00a0The editors added that\u00a0\"it isn\u2019t clear why Hunter hasn\u2019t been\" charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent for hisprevious roleon the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.An Attempt to 'Muddy the Waters':Hunter's \"true offense is being the son of a president whom Republicans are hell-bent on vilifying and defeating,\" a\u00a0writer forLos Angeles Times (Lean Left bias)said. The writer argued that the\u00a0plea deal represented \"a fairly common means of disposing of less serious charges,\" while these charges against \"a relatively harmless firearm applicant seems to be without precedent\" and give\u00a0\"radical Republicans in Congress the talking point they need to muddy the waters with respect to Trump\u2019s multiple criminal indictments.\"",
