Biden explained that the intelligence community was considering the theory as one of \u201ctwo likely scenarios\u201d with \u201clow or moderate confidence,\u201d but that it had not reached a definitive conclusion. \u201cThe majority of [intelligence community] elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other,\u201d Biden said.Coverage tended to discuss similar quotes and facts about the story regardless of bias rating. Some right-rated outlets featured the story with opinion\u00a0content criticizing media and Democratic political figures for disregarding the Wuhan lab theory.",
