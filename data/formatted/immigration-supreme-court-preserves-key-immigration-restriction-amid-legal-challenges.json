    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the Title 42 immigration policy can remain in effect.The Details:The courtvoted 5-4 in favorof preserving the policy while legal challenges play out, meaning it'll remain in place for at least several months. The ruling extends Chief Justice John Roberts'temporary\u00a0preservationof\u00a0the policy, which he handed down last week. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the court's three liberals in dissent to Tuesday's ruling.For Context:The Biden administrationmoved to endthe Trump-era policy earlier this year, which was enacted amid the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to allow Border Patrol to quickly deport unauthorized migrants over public health concerns. Republicans and border state leaders had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court to step in and block a lower court opinion that ordered Title 42 to end. Recently,record-high migration levelshaveintensified furtherin anticipation of the policy's termination.How the Media Covered It:The news was a top story from sources across the spectrum on Tuesday. Some right-rated outlets continue to frame the policy as necessary amid record levels of unauthorized migrants arriving at the southern border. Some left-rated outlets continue to frame the policy as inhumane and unfair to people seeking asylum.",
