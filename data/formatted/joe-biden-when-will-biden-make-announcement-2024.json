    "summary": "President Joe Biden may be spending some time considering a potential 2024\u00a0reelection run as he vacations in St. Croix this week.Key Quotes:\u00a0\"Fundraising and anti-coordination rules become stricter once you officially announce, so it is at least legally advantageous to delay the official paperwork at this stage,\" Middlebury College political science professor Bertram Johnson said. \"My sense is that after the 2022 elections, Biden\u2019s hand has been strengthened with the Democrats in Congress and nationally, so he may have more freedom to decide at his own pace as a result.\"For Context: If Biden announces a 2024 campaigning\u00a0at the beginning of 2023, if would be early compared to many of his predecessors. Additionally, three presidents announced they were not seeking reelections relatively late in the year: Calvin Coolidge (in August 1927), Harry Truman (in August 1952), and Lyndon Johnson (in March 1968).How the Media Covered it: Right-rated sources\u00a0focused on the reasons some Democrats are advising Biden to delay any announcement about his plans for 2024.\u00a0 Left-rated sources often framed the\u00a0St. Croix vacation as a needed break for the president and his wife Jill prior to considering a potential 2024 run and returning to Washington to face Republicans' new majority in the House of Representatives.",
