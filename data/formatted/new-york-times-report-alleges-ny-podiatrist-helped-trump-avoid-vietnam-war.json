    "headline": "New York Times Report Alleges Ny Podiatrist Helped Trump Avoid Vietnam War",
    "summary": "A New York Times report alleges that a podiatrist in Queens, NY helped President Trump avoid the Vietnam War by signing off on a fake bone spur diagnosis as a favor to Trump's father, Fred Trump, who owned the doctor's office building. The article has come under some scrutiny from right-leaning publications and media personalities who have criticized its lack of corroborating evidence, particularly since the podiatrist in question is deceased.",
