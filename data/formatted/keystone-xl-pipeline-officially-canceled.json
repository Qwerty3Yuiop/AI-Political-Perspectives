    "headline": "Keystone Xl Pipeline Officially Canceled",
    "summary": "The Keystone XL pipeline project was officially canceled this week after President Joe Biden rescinded a key\u00a0permit for it earlier this year. The $9 billion pipeline would have transported roughly 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Canada to Nebraska, and wasexpected to create roughly 10,000 new jobs. It was first proposed in 2008, but faced ongoing protests and challenges from environmental groups and Indigenous communities. President Barack Obama first halted the project in 2015, but President Donald Trump approved a permit for it in 2017. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden pledged to stop the project once again.Left- and right-rated media often framed the news very differently. Coverage from left-rated sources tended to paint the news as a win for environmental activists and Indigenous groups, and focus on the pipeline's potential negative environmental effects. Some reports from right-rated sources instead highlighted local communities in South Dakota who were counting on the pipeline as an economic stimulant, framing them as having been let down by the cancellation.",
