    "summary": "Anti-Trump Republican Rep.Liz Cheney's loss in Wyomingwas the major takeaway from Tuesday's 2022 primaries.Cheney lost to Trump-backed Harriet Hageman.Hageman took 66% of the vote, to Cheney's 29%.Her loss means that just two of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot are now out of office. Cheney, a third-term member of the House, is the Vice Chair of the House select committee investigating the riot, and has been astaunch critic of\u00a0Trump. Hageman, who turned from Trump critic in 2016 to endorsee in 2022, told supporters Tuesday night that \"Wyoming has spoken and we have made it clear \u2014 we are taking our country back.\"In Alaska, anti Trump Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski will advance to the general election along with her primary opponent, Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka. Alaska's non-partisan primary system means that the top four finishers in each primary move on to the general election. Meanwhile, 2008 Republican vice presidential nomineeSarah Palin is attempting a political comebackin the special election to fill the rest of the late Rep. Don Young's House term. Those results likely won't be clear for several weeks.Cheney's loss was the top storyfrom news sources across the political spectrum Wednesday morning.",
