    "summary": "Voters in the world\u2019s largest democracy handed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a narrower win than expected, prompting reflections on the state of Indian democracy and\u00a0relations with the U.S.The Details:More than 640 million votes were cast inIndia\u2019s parliamentary elections\u2014 representing a group nearlytwice the size of the entire U.S. population.Modi declared victory on Tuesday evening, but his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to secure an outright majority and will need to form a coalition to govern. U.S. President Joe Biden,who hosted Modi at the White House in 2023,congratulated the Indian leader on his \u201chistoric\u201d win.For Context:As U.S. relations with China soured in recent years, U.S. business and political leaders have increasingly looked to India as an alternative. However, some have voiced concern over Modi\u2019s alignment with Hindu nationalism, or Hindutva,which has pitted the popular leader against the country\u2019s 200 million Muslims.How the Media Covered It:Several center and left-rated mainstream outlets published analyses labeling the election outcome a \u201cstunning setback\u201d for Modi or a \u201cwin for competitive democracy.\u201d Conversely, outlets on the right tended not to publish original coverage on the Indian elections, matching past trends on covering international stories.",
