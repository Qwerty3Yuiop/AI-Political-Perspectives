    "headline": "Michael Cohen Pleads Guilty Says Trump Directed Him Break Campaign Finance Law",
    "summary": "President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight criminal charges, testifying that Trump directed him to break campaign finance law by arranging payments to two women who said they had affairs with then-candidate Trump. Many on the Left say that Cohen's plea is hugely problematic for the president as it implicates him as a co-conspirator. However, some others say that, while the charges are troublesome, they won't necessarily lead to impeachment.",
