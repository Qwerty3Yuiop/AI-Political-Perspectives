    "summary": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he and Republican leaders drew a \"red line\" on hiking certain taxes to fund President Joe Biden's infrastructure spending proposal during the first bipartisan meeting with the top members of congressional leadership at the White House on Wednesday. Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure bill has faced resistance from Republicans in Congress, with disagreements over the amount and definitions of \"infrastructure.\" The meeting also included Vice President Kamala Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. After the meeting, McConnell and McCarthy told reporters they both made clear that Republicans are not willing to budge on the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by former President Donald Trump. However, McConnell said \"I think that it is safe to say there is certainly a bipartisan desire to get an outcome.\"Biden told MSNBC Wednesdayafter the meeting he sees room for a compromise, but will move forward on key aspects of his proposal without the opposing party if necessary.\n\nThe story received wide coverage across the spectrum; coverage from both sides highlighted McConnell's and Biden's respective remarks, as well as the details of the disagreement over the package.",
