    "headline": "Supreme Court Declines Hear Transgender Bathroom Case",
    "summary": "On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear a case regarding a Virginia school board's policy on transgender students' bathroom use. In 2015, transgender student Gavin Grimm sued the Gloucester County school board after it banned Grimm from using the boys' restroom. The board attempted to appeal last year's ruling by the\u00a04th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; the ruling said\u00a0transgender students are protected under Title IX , which bans\u00a0sex discrimination in education.\u00a0The court did not give a reason for its rejection; Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have taken on the case.\u00a0This comes after theSupreme Court last year expanded the definitionof discrimination on the basis of \"sex\u201d in the workplace to include\u00a0\u201cgender identity\" and \"sexual orientation.\"\u00a0Earlier this month, the Education Department also expanded the definition of the federal\u00a0sex discrimination ban\u00a0to include \"gender identity,\" citing the Supreme Court's 2020 ruling.The story received wide coverage across the spectrum. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight quotes from Grimm and from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who represented Grimm. Some right-rated outlets also highlighted the Supreme Court's 2020 ruling and the Education Department's announcement, placing it\u00a0in the context of the ongoing debate surrounding transgender athletes in women's sports.",
