    "summary": "Russia reportedly fired missiles at an aircraft repair facility\u00a0near Lviv on Friday in Western Ukraine, far from the fighting further east and just 43 miles from the Polish border.Explosions were heard Friday near Lviv, andvideos circulating on social mediaappeared to show black smoke rising from the facility. Lviv's mayor\u00a0said several missiles struck the\u00a0facility, damaging and destroying buildings but causing no casualties. The attack follows a\u00a0Russian strike on the Yavoriv military base, located between Lviv and the Polish border, which reportedly\u00a0killed\u00a0at least 35 people. Lviv has become a hub for refugees fleeing the fighting in eastern Ukraine, as well as for many media organizations and embassies that were forced to leave the capital of Kyiv amid the Russian advance. It is also key to western Ukraine's supply lanes, which have become essential as Russia advances from the east and the south.Sources across the spectrum, especially on the left and center, covered the missile strike prominently. Many highlighted how the strikes hit just miles from Poland and NATO territory, and warned that more attacks in the region could force NATO nations \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 into the conflict.",
