    "headline": "Mccarthy Opposes January 6 Commission",
    "summary": "On Tuesday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said he opposes a proposal to form an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. McCarthy argues that the commission would fail to investigate last summer's protests and riots across American cities, and accuses Democrats of over-politicizing the situation. McCarthy's opposition likely erodes GOP support ahead of a vote later this week.\n\nHis opposition follows accusations from Representative Liz Cheney \u2013 who was ousted from her GOP leadership role with McCarthy\u2019s support \u2013 that he withheld critical information about his response to the events of Jan. 6.",
