    "headline": "Science Scientists Achieve Breakthrough Unlimited Energy Source",
    "summary": "Scientists at a U.S. government laboratory in California reportedly\u00a0took a big step toward producing an unlimited, clean energy source,according tothe Energy Department.Key Quotes:The scientists \"made a breakthrough in the pursuit of limitless, zero-carbon power by achieving a net energy gain in a fusion reaction for the first time,\" as first reported in an\u00a0anonymously-sourcedstoryfrom theFinancial Times (Center bias)that was then confirmed by multiple news outlets.In Layman's Terms:Scientists have long been working on developing nuclear fusion, the energy source\u00a0that powers the sun. Successful nuclear fusion reactions\u00a0require only a small amount of hydrogen to conduct and generate large amounts of energy without emitting\u00a0carbon or\u00a0lasting radioactive waste.Where People Agree:Many sources across the spectrum highlighted the development as\u00a0major and objectively positive. Many headlines emphasized that the scientists are based in the U.S., and how\u00a0other scientists around the world\u00a0have also been approaching the breakthrough.Where People Disagree:Some framed fusion energy as a potential additional option alongside\u00a0common energy sources.\u00a0Others framed it as an outright replacement\u00a0and solution in the context of pollution and climate change.\u00a0CNN described it as a step to unleashing \"an infinite source of clean energy that could help end dependence on fossil fuels.\" Some were outwardly critical.Bloomberg\u00a0(Lean Left bias)'s energy columnistsaidon Twitter that he's \"skeptical of surprisingly well-timed announcements by budget-starved laboratories about breakthroughs for technologies decades away.\"Updated 12/13/22 at 1:07 p.m. ET with the Energy Department's announcement.",
