    "summary": "Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram experienced a major worldwide\u00a0outage on Monday. The company says the outage was due to\u00a0an internal technical issue related to faulty configuration changes in the company's internal tools. The failure disrupted the digital lives of many politicians, small-business owners, aid workers\u00a0and others. The outage also reportedly hampered Facebook's ability to fix\u00a0the crash and employees' abilities to access company tools. The company is already under fire after a whistle-blower, Frances\u00a0Haugen,shared internal documents claiming that Facebookknows of its negative impacts on public health but chooses\u00a0to prioritize profit.The news was covered prominently across the spectrum with few partisan divides in coverage.",
