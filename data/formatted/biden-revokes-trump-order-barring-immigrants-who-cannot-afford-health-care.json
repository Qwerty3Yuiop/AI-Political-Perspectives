    "summary": "President Joe Biden reversed a 2019 executive order by former President Donald Trump that would have prevented immigrants from obtaining visas unless they proved they could obtain health insurance or pay for health care. \u201cMy Administration is committed to expanding access to quality, affordable healthcare,\u201d Biden stated Friday. \u201cwe can achieve that objective...without barring the entry of noncitizens who seek to immigrate lawfully to this country but who lack significant financial means or have not purchased health insurance coverage from a restrictive list of qualifying plans.\u201d The action is the latest of Biden's efforts to roll back the previous administration's policies; also on Friday, the White House made public an executive order revoking Trump's order to construct a \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\" \n\nThe story received coverage across the political spectrum.",
