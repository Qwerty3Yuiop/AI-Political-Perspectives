    "summary": "The U.S. House passed passed legislation to address hate crimes against Asian Americans Tuesday. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) introduced the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act in March to combat violence and discrimination against Asian Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The legislation includes provisions for a position at the Justice Department to review of COVID-19-related hate crimes; aims to provide grants for states to create hotlines for reporting hate crimes; and funds grants for law enforcement training on how to prevent and identify hate crime. The vote was 364-62, with all the votes in opposition from Republicans; the Senate last month approved the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act with a 94-1 vote, with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) the only vote against the bill. The legislation will now head to President Joe Biden's desk. \n\nThe story received coverage across the political spectrum. Coverage from the center and left tended to focus on the details of the bill; some right-rated outlets highlighted GOP lawmakers' comments about lack of Republican input.",
