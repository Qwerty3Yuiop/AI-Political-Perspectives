    "summary": "As Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi won the speakership, vowing to focus on climate change, health care, and LGBTQ equality. Some criticized Pelosi and the Democrats for their agenda, characterizing it as fiscally irresponsible, weak on border security, and obstructionist in their plans to investigate President Trump. Others hailed the new Speaker as a political powerhouse capable of outsmarting Trump and savvily executing the party's legislative goals over the next two years.",
