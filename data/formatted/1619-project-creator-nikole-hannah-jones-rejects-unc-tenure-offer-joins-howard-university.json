    "summary": "Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of The New York Times Magazine\u2019s 1619 Project, has declined a tenured position at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will instead join Howard University as the Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism,a new tenured position. UNC, Hannah-Jones\u2019 alma mater, initially attempted to offer her a\u00a0traditionally tenured position as\u00a0Knight Chair butlowered its\u00a0offer to a five-year contractfollowing opposition\u00a0from conservative critics andWalter Hussman, a major donor and the journalism school's namesake.UNC later\u00a0renewed its tenure offeron June 30. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Hannah-Jones said she had been treated \u201cshabbily\u201d by UNC, explaining, \u201cThe Knight chairs are designed for professional journalists when working in the field, to come into academia. Every other chair before me, who also happened to be white, received that position with tenure.\u201d Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., also announced the hiring of writer and Howard alumnus\u00a0Ta-Nehisi Coates.Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to mention that Hannah-Jones won a Pulitzer Prize for her work on The 1619 Project. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to describe conservatives\u2019 criticisms as \u201cconcerns\u201d and The 1619 Project as \u201ccontroversial.\u201d",
