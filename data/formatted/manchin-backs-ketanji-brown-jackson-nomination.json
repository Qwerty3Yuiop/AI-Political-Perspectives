    "summary": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)said Friday morning that he would vote in favor ofKetanji Brown Jackson\u2019s nominationto the Supreme Court.Manchin\u2019s support nearly guarantees Jackson\u2019s eventual appointment, since no Senate Democrat has opposed the nomination andfilibustersare not allowed on judicial confirmations.In a statement posted to Twitter, Manchin said he had met with Jackson and found her to be \u201cwarm and gracious,\u201d adding, \u201cI am confident that Judge Jackson is supremely qualified and has the disposition necessary to serve as our nation\u2019s next Supreme Court Justice.\u201d A final confirmation vote is expected in early April.Coverage was widespread and mostly balanced across the spectrum on Friday. While some say it is biased to label Republican criticisms as \u201cattacks,\u201d that framing was present in some outlets on both sides, includingFox News (Right)andCNN (Left). Coverage from both sides also noted that Jackson would be the first black woman on the Supreme Court.",
