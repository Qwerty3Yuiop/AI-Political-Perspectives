    "headline": "Perspectives Media And Andrew Cuomo",
    "summary": "After New York\u00a0Attorney General Letitia James said a probe had determined thatGov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women, widespread media coverage followed soon after \u2014 as did media criticism. Cuomo has gained national prominence in recent years, due in large part to his public feuds with former President Donald Trump and his state's response to\u00a0the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor has\u00a0been a constant figure in media coverage of these subjects, while also being the main focus of\u00a0other narratives, such as his potential to run for president or his administration's allegedcover-up of COVID-19-related deaths in nursing homes.Right-rated outlets and voices focus more on Cuomo's relationship with the media than left- and center-rated outlets. Many on the right accuse major\u00a0news sources of being biased in Cuomo's favor throughout the pandemic, and softening public perception of him while masking controversies. Some focused specifically on CNN and primetime host\u00a0Chris Cuomo, Andrew's brother, who\u00a0frequently hosted him on his weeknight TV show during the pandemic and reportedly advised him amid the sexual harassment probe.",
