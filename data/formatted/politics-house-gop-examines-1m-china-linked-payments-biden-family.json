    "summary": "On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee published a memo alleging Hunter Biden and two other family members received over $1 million indirectly from a Chinese company.The Details:The records were obtained after a subpoena of Bank of America by committee chairman James Comer (R-KY). The payments came from accounts related to Rob Walker, Hunter\u2019s business associate, and their Chinese business ventures in 2017. A day before the funds were wired from Walker\u2019s account, he received a $3 million payment from Chinese company, State Energy HK Limited. Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team stresses that the payments were made to family members, not the president himself.For Context:The probe is led by Republicans, whowon back a House majority in November.Key Quotes:Rep. Comer said, \u201cWe will continue to follow the money trail and facts to determine if President Biden is compromised by his family\u2019s business schemes and if there is a national security threat.\u201d A spokesperson for Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team called the probe a \u201cbaseless right-wing conspiracy\u201d, and said Hunter and his partners were \u201cseeking a joint venture with a privately-owned, legitimate energy company in China.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:Despite being covered by some of the biggest outlets, the story was not widely covered across the spectrum. Fox News went more in-depth on Comer\u2019s comments, while CNN did the same for the comments from Democratic representatives. Newsweek compared the payments to those received by business dealings of Former President Donald Trump",
