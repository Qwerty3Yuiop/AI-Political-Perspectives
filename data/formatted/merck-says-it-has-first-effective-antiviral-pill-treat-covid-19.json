    "summary": "American drugmaker Merck announced Friday that it will seek emergency authorization of an experimental antiviral pill known as\u00a0molnupiravir after it\u00a0significantly reduced the worst effects of COVID-19 in clinical trials. The company said that in the trials, the\u00a0treatment cut the risk of hospitalization or death in half when given to high-risk patients\u00a0within the first five days of COVID-19 symptoms.\u00a0By inserting errors into the virus' genetic code,\u00a0the drug can reportedly minimize\u00a0the duration of illness, mitigate serious symptoms and\"limit transmission to people in your household if you are sick.\"Some experts\u00a0are\"optimistic that molnupiravir can become an important medicine as part of the global effort to fight the pandemic\"if authorized, alleviating\u00a0pressure on hospitals and curbing infections in poorer areas across the globe. Merck said it expects to complete the third phase of trials by early November.\u00a0Two other antiviral pills are being developed: one by Pfizer, and the other by Atea Pharmaceuticals and Roche. Both are expected to release their trial results in the coming months.Coverage was prominent across the spectrum, with most outlets highlighting hopeful barometers\u00a0that molnupiravir could play a key role\u00a0in ending the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Some outlets also emphasized how White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients said the antiviral pill could be an \u201cadditional tool in our toolbox\u201d but that vaccinations remain the strongest tool.",
