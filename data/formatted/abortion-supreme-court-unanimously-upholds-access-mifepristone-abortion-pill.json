    "headline": "Abortion Supreme Court Unanimously Upholds Access Mifepristone Abortion Pill",
    "summary": "The United States Supreme Court rejected a legal challenge to the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of mifepristone, an abortion pill, upholding access to the drug.Detail:In a unanimous decision, the justices ruled the challengers, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, lacked standing to bring the case by not demonstrating sufficient harm stemming from the FDA\u2019s approval of the drug in 2000.Key Quotes:Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the court by former President Donald Trump, wrote the decision, stating that the challengers \u201cfailed to demonstrate that FDA's relaxed regulatory requirements likely would cause them to suffer an injury in fact,\u201d adding, \u201cFor that reason, the federal courts are the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs' concerns about FDA's actions. The plaintiffs may present their concerns and objections to the President and FDA in the regulatory process, or to Congress and the President in the legislative process.\u201d Abigail Long, a spokesperson for Danco, the manufacturer of mifepristone, stated, \u201cWe are pleased with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this incredibly important case. By rejecting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s radical, unprecedented and unsupportable interpretation of who has standing to sue, the justices reaffirmed longstanding basic principles of administrative law.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum framed the ruling as a victory for the Biden Administration, which has championed access to abortions.The Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)emphasized that the ruling did not address the FDA\u2019s regulation of mifepristone but simply rejected the standing of this specific challenge.",
