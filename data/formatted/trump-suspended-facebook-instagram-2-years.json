    "summary": "Facebook announced Fridaythat former President Donald Trump's accounts would be suspended for two years, \"effective from the date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year.\" After two years, Facebook \"will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded.\" The company suspended Trump indefinitely \"following his praise for people engaged\" in the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6; last month, Facebook's new Oversight Board upheld the suspension but criticized its indefinite nature.Politico (lean Left bias) reportedthat Trump reacted to Friday's ruling, calling it \"an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election.\"Trump's Facebook suspension and the company's handling of it, especially the Oversight Board, have remained in the news since January. Some reports from left-rated sources highlighted activists who criticized the less severe punishment. Some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on Trump's reaction to the announcement.",
