    "summary": "Los Angeles County announced Thursday\u00a0it will reinstate an indoor mask mandate for residents regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status. The manate will go into effect on Sunday. This comes after the county suggested two weeks ago that both vaccinated and unvaccinated residents wear masks amid the spread of the Delta variant.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not where we need to be for the millions at risk of infection here in Los Angeles County, and waiting to do something will be too late given what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d county\u00a0health officer Dr. Muntu Davis said Thursday.The Los Angeles Times (Lean Left bias)reported\u00a0an average of 1,077 new cases each day in the past week, a\u00a0261% increase from the daily\u00a0average two weeks ago. Davis said he expects the mandate to remain until the county sees improvements in case transmissions.Coverage from the left and center tended to highlight rising COVID-19 case numbers in the county, and speculate whether other regions with surging case numbers\u00a0would follow suit.Some voices on the rightcriticized the decision, calling it a\u00a0\"fear-driven\"\u00a0attempt to encourage more residents to get vaccinated.",
