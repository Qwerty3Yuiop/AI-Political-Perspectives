    "summary": "Pfizer-BioNTech has begun a study comparing its original COVID-19 vaccine with doses specially altered\u00a0to combat the Omicron variant.The study will involve\u00a0three trials in adults ages 18-55 to determine if a vaccine specifically for the Omicron variant is more effective than the shots that are currently given.It is not clear that a change in the vaccine will be ordered, since areas where the Omicron surge began are already seeing adecrease in cases, and since future variants may not resemble Omicron.\u00a0 In\u00a0the meantime, the original vaccine still offers good protection against severe illness and death.",
