Sources regardless of biascontinue to display inconsistency in highlighting\u00a0monthly versus\u00a0annual inflationin headlines, and many fail to explain the distinction to their readers. NBC News's headline said inflation \"fell slightly to 8.3%,\" while Fox Business's said \"inflation rose 8.3%\" and CNBC's said \"inflation rose 0.1%.\" Left- and center-rated sources focused more on falling gas prices. Right-rated sources focused more on high food prices and how inflation rose more than economists predicted.",
