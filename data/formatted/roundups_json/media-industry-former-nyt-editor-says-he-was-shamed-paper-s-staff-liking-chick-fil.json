    "summary": "This week, former conservativeNew York Times Opinion (Left bias)editor Alex Rubenstein alleged in an op-ed published inThe Atlantic (Left bias)that he was shamed by the paper\u2019s staff for saying he liked Chick-Fil-A, drawing media perspectives.The Details:Rubenstein said he was at an orientation session when he was asked his favorite sandwich as part of a team-building exercise. Claiming he wanted to be relatable, he suggested Chick-Fil-A\u2019s spicy chicken sandwich. Rubenstein said the HR representative leading the orientation told him, \u201cWe don\u2019t do that here. They hate gay people,\u201d which was met by applause from his coworkers.For Context:Rubenstein oversaw the publishing of theinfamous June 2020 Tom Cotton op-edwhich suggested the federal government should use military force to quell the George Floyd riots. The piece caused a lot of discontent among the Times\u2019 staff at the time. Chick-Fil-A has long been seenas an organization whose leadership has conservative valuesandanti-LGBT sentiments.Debunked Accusations?:Several liberal journalists, including Nikole Hannah Jones of the TimesaccusedRubenstein of fabricating the story. A spokesperson forThe Atlantic defended Rubenstein\u2019s claim, saying The Atlantic confirmed the story\u2019s authenticity with Times staff members. Erik Wemple ofThe Washington Post (Lean Left bias)reportedthat several of Rubenstein\u2019s colleagues at the Times verified his claim as factually accurate.How The Media Covered It:The story was widely and almost exclusively covered by outlets on the right.",
