    "summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionannounced Fridaythat they will no longer recommend masking indoors for\u00a0most counties across the U.S.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky saidthe guidance was changedto \"give people a break from mask-wearing\" now thatthe overall risk of severe disease from COVID-19 is now generally lower. Under the new guidelines, which include\u00a0public schools,counties are classifiedas\u00a0low (green), medium (yellow) or high (orange) risk\u00a0based on the rate of new COVID-19 cases and hospital capacity.\u00a0Areas with more than 200 new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days\u00a0will be categorized in the high-risk\u00a0level. CDC officials said about 23% of U.S. counties currently have\u00a0low levels of COVID-19 cases, 39.6% have medium levels and 37.3% have high levels.\u00a0More than 35 states already\u00a0dropped their mask requirements,according to the National Academy for State Health Policy.The new CDC guidelines were prominently covered across the spectrum. Left-rated outlets were more likely to emphasize the CDC continues to urge people to \"get vaccinated and boosted, and get tested if they have symptoms.\" Some right-rated outlets highlighted the criticism that the CDC has faced in recent weeks for\u00a0\"an apparent lag in updated masking guidance.\"",
