    "summary": "President Joe Biden said Monday that activists had behaved inappropriately when theyconfrontedArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Sunday, but that such confrontations were not unusual. Activists fromLiving United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA)had confronted Sinema and followed her into an Arizona State University bathroom while criticizing her opposition to Democrats' budget reconciliation bill.\u00a0Responding to reporters, Biden said, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re appropriate tactics, but it happens to everybody. The only people it doesn\u2019t happen to is people who have Secret Service standing around them. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201d Sinema herselfcondemnedthe confrontation, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d\u00a0\u00a0and \u201cwholly inappropriate.\u201dCoverage was more common in\u00a0center- and\u00a0right-rated outlets, some of which framed Biden\u2019s \u201cit happens to everybody\u201d line as a dismissal of the incident. Left-rated outlets were more likely to call the activists \u201cyouth organizers,\u201d with other outlets labeling them \u201cactivists\u201d or \u201corganizers.\u201d",
