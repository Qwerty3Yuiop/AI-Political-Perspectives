    "summary": "U.S. regulators have strictly limited who can receive the Johnson & Johnson\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine due to the\u00a0risk of rare but severe blood clots.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)said Thursdaythat adults should only get the J&J shot if \u201cthey would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine\u201d\u00a0or if they can't receive one of the mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer. The shot will now be\u00a0limited to people ages 18 and older who are\u00a0medically ineligible for another approved vaccine or who only have access to the J&J vaccine and want one.U.S. authorities have recommended for months\u00a0that Americansget Pfizer or Moderna shots instead of J&J\u2019sdue to potentially serious side effects. The Moderna and\u00a0Pfizer vaccines are two-dose vaccines and use mRNA technology; J&J\u2019s single-shot vaccine uses adenovirus technology.The news was covered by sources across the political spectrum. Left- and center-rated sources placed more emphasis on how rare the blood clot side effects are compared to right-rated sources. Some reports from the left also highlighted an FDA official who said that the \"known and potential benefits of the vaccine\" still currently outweigh the negatives.",
