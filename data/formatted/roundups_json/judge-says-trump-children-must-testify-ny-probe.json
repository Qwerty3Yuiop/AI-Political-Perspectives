    "summary": "A New York judge ruled Thursday that former President Donald Trump and two of his children must testify in the state attorney general's probe into their family company's business.The Trump family has been fighting\u00a0the subpoenas for their sworn testimony, arguing that Attorney General Letitia James\u00a0is targeting the former president for political reasons. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron denied their efforts, saying James had found \"copious evidence of possible financial fraud\" and ordering\u00a0the former president, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0to appear for depositions within 21 days. Jamesannounced the subpoenas for Trump's childrenlast month, and subpoenaed the federal government earlier this month forrecords on Washington D.C.'s Trump Hotel.The news was covered prominently by left- and center-rated outlets, many of which focused on the reasoning behind Engoron's decision. Some right-rated outlets highlighted the Trump family's criticism of James and the probe.",
