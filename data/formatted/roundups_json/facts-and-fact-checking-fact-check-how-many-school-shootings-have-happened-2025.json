    "summary": "Different definitions of \"school shootings\" fuel public confusion about school safety and violent crime in the U.S.Different Data:There are multiple commonly cited sources tracking U.S. \"school shootings.\"The K-12 Violence Project, run by data scientistDavid Riedman, has a \"K-12 School Shooting Database\" counting\u00a0any incident \"when a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time, or day of the week.\"\u00a0This tracker has counted 207 school shootings in 2025.EducationWeek (Center bias), a news organization,uses more limited criteriaand has counted 13 school shootings in 2025. The K-12 Violence Projectcounted 330 school shootings in 2024, versus 39 countedby EducationWeek.CNN (Lean Left bias)conducted its own analysis of the data, and concluded that 83 school shootings happened in 2024 as of Dec. 16.How the Media Covers It:Many sources, especially on the left and center but also some on the right, cite the K-12 Violence Project data when reporting on the \"number of school shootings\" in a given timeframe.The Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)is among the sources thatusethe EducationWeek data.The Daily Mail (Right bias)cited CNN's data.Why the Difference:People on the left are generally in favor of gun restrictions and may gravitate toward data sources that emphasize problems with guns. People on the right are generally less supportive of gun restrictions and may gravitate toward data sources that make gun problems seem less severe.This summary will be updated throughout 2025.
