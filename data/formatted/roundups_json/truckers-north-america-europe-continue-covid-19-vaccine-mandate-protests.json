    "summary": "Taking afterCanada's 'Freedom Convoy', truckers in the U.S. and Europe are reportedly forming mass protests against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.In the Canadian province of Ontario, officials declared a state of emergency and threatened protesters with fines and jail time as anti-vaccine mandate protests by truckers and others continue to shut down parts of Ottawa andWindsor's Ambassador Bridge, a key\u00a0US-Canada trade link. On Friday, bridge protesters opened a lane of traffic for U.S. vehicles entering Canada.\u00a0In France,dozens of truckers drove to\u00a0Paristo protest the country's vaccination pass program. And in the U.S., the Department of Homeland Security is warning thatAmerican\u00a0truckers are planning\u00a0a similar protest convoy, which could start as early as this weekend at the Super Bowl in Los Angeles before heading east to Washington D.C. in time for President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech on March 1.The protests, especially those in Canada, made headlines across the spectrum. Right-rated outlets highlight the purportedly massive size of the convoys and groups of protesters, and reports of Biden and other Democrats working with Canada to clear out protesters on the bridge. Many left- and center-rated sources focused on Ontario's state of emergency declaration and the extent of the traffic and economic disruptions caused by road blockages.",
