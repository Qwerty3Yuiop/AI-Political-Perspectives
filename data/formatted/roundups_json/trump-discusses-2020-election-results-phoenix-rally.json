    "summary": "At an event titled \u201cRally for Election Integrity,\u201d former President Donald Trump spoke to his supporters at the Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix about the 2020 presidential election results. He thanked the \u201cbrave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona State Senate\u201d for supporting the ongoing audit that claims the 2020 election included elements of fraud. Trump also criticized President Joe Biden for adding critical race theory to school curriculums, not doing enough to stop the spread of COVID-19 and allowing the US to get\u00a0\"pushed around\"\u00a0by other countries. Additionally, the former president claimed that the US is on its way to \"becoming a communist country.\"Left-rated outlets often emphasized how Trump is holding onto \"false election claims\" and how\u00a0the Arizona Federal Theatre exceeded its capacity limits. Right-rated outlets spotlighted the former president's critiques of Republican leaders who accepted the 2020 election results and his stance on critical race theory.",
