In the immediate aftermath of the riot,a Suffolk pollfound that 70% of voters believed the rioters were criminals. That number now sits at 48%. Of those polled, 6% deemed the rioter\u2019s actions \u201cjustified,\u201d up from 2% in the immediate aftermath.FBI Involvement?AWashington Post-University of Maryland pollfound that 25% of respondents believe the FBI \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d played a role in instigating the riot. Of those believing the FBI was involved, 45% believe there is \u201csolid evidence\u201d backing this claim, and 53% say it is their \u201csuspicion only.\u201d Broken down by party, 34% of Republicans polled believe the FBI instigated the riot, compared to 30% of Independents and 13% of Democrats.
