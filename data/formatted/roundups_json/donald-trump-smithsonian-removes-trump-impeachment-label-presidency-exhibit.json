    "summary": "The Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History has removed references to President Trump\u2019s two impeachments from an exhibit called \u201cThe American Presidency: A Glorious Burden\u201d.The Details:The removal comes as the Smithsonian conducts an internal review of its content for potential \u201cpolitical or partisan influence\u201d, following a directive from its Board of Regents, andprevious callsfrom the Trump administration for a more positive framing of US history. The Smithsonian said in a statement that \u201ca future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments.\" Smithsonian spokeswoman, \u00a0Linda St. Thomas, said Trump's impeachments will beincludedin the exhibit at the time of the fuller update.\u00a0Until then, the display has returned to its 2008 appearance.For Context:A temporary label about Trump\u2019s impeachments were added to the display in 2021, adding to prior information about the impeachments of presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Richard M. Nixon. It was intended to be a \u201cshort-term measure\u201d to address \u201ccurrent events\u201d at the time. Trump is the only American president to have been impeached twice\u2013in 2019 and again in 2021. He was acquitted both times after facing trials in the Senate.How the Media Covered It:The Washington Post (Lean Left bias)first reported the story. It framed the change within broader concerns about political interference at the Smithsonian and how the institution could be shaped by the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to control its work.Washington Examiner (Lean Right)framed the removal as part of a broader cultural shift influenced by conservative criticism of progressive narratives in national institutions.The Hill (Center)highlighted Democratic backlash, quoting multiple statements from lawmakers including Rep. Mark Pocan, Sen. Adam Schiff, and Gov. Gavin Newsom.Written by the AllSides staff (of humans).Learn more.Support our mission.",
