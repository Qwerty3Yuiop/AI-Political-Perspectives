The White House shared a pre-recorded message from President Biden on Friday,\u00a0calling unity\u00a0\"the central lesson\" of the 9/11 attacks.\u00a0\"Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing,\" Biden said.\u00a0\"But we must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation.\" Biden then stood alongside\u00a0former presidents Barrack Obama and Bill Clinton at the National 9/11\u00a0Memorial and Museum on Saturday. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President George W. Bush further emphasized the significance of unity\u00a0at the memorial service for the victims and heroes of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, PA. Harris said \"we were all reminded that\u00a0unity is possible\u00a0in America\" in the days following the 9/11 attacks. While Bush said those days of unity \"seem distant\u00a0from our own,\"\u00a0that time\u00a0represented \"the truest version of ourselves\" and \"what we can be again.\"\u00a0Meanwhile,former President Donald Trump launched a partisan\u00a0attackagainst\u00a0Biden\u00a0\u201cand his inept administration\" for\u00a0surrendering \u201cin defeat\u201d by withdrawing troops from\u00a0Afghanistan.Coverage didn't differ much along partisan lines, highlighting unity over polarizing messages.
