    "headline": "Politico S New Owner Under Fire Email Complimenting Trump Administration",
    "summary": "Politico (Lean Left Bias),the online news publication that was recently acquired by German media company Axel Springer, is in the headlines after theWashington Post (Lean Left Bias)published aprofile of Axel Springer CEO Mathias D\u00f6pfner, amedia mogul leading the push to steer Politico towards more neutral news coverage.The profile outlines D\u00f6pfner\u2019s perspective on the state and future of political journalism, including his \"contrarian\" bet that centrist news reporting is not only the right call in terms of fair reporting, but the smart move economically for a publication.The part of the profile that mediaoutlets across the spectrum latched onto was an email sent by D\u00f6pfnerto company executives prior to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. In the email, D\u00f6pfner asks \u201cdo we all want to get together for an hour in the morning on November 3 and pray that Donald Trump will again become President of the United States of America?\u201d The comment, which D\u00f6pfner initially denied before saying he was joking, appeared to be in response to theU.S. government suing Googlefor abuse of market dominance.The profile was covered more heavily by left-rated outlets, with right rated outlets mainly covering response from the left. The email regarding Trump was the primary topic of headlines, with many on the left deeming D\u00f6pfner\u2019s nonpartisan mission to be compromised by his privately-voiced support of the former president. Outlets across the\u00a0spectrum drew connections to recent efforts fromCNN (Left Bias)tomove towards more centrist news content.",
