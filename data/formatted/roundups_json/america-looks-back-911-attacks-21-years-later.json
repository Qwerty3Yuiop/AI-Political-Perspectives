Whatever course the country was on track to take into the 21st century, the agony of that day undoubtedly altered the direction.This year, Americans look back not only on the terror attacks, now two decades past, but also themore recent scaroflast year\u2019s chaotic end to the war in Afghanistan, the conflict ignited in the heat of grief and anger that followed the towers\u2019 fall. Remembrance of 9/11 this year is unique in that there is no war, or recent withdrawal from war, to point to as evidence of the continued impact of the attacks.As the pain of the attacks recedes deeper into history, manymedia outlets published stories not only remembering the attacks themselves, but also how the memory exists in the minds of Americans. In an article from NBC News, apollwas broken down to reveal that the axiom of \u2018never forget\u2019 is complicated by the growing number of Americans that weren\u2019t old enough to remember.
