    "summary": "President Joe Biden\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0calledthe newly-enacted Texas law that bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detectedan \"unprecedented assault on a woman's constitutional rights.\"The Heartbeat\u00a0Act (SB 8), which took effect on Wednesday after the Supreme Court allowed it to stand,has received\u00a0sharp dissenting reactionsas the law\u00a0empowers citizens to sue health care providers or any individual suspected of\u00a0helping a woman get an abortion. Biden said his administration will launch a \u201cwhole-of-government effort to respond to this decision\u201d and examine\u00a0\u201cwhat steps the federal government can take to ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions as protected by Roe [v. Wade].\u201d He also emphasized how the law is so extreme that it \"does not even allow for exceptions in the case of rape or incest.\"Some left-rated outlets highlighted how Biden used\u00a0the word \"abortion\" for the first time during a public remark or\u00a0statement on Wednesday in his time as president.\u00a0As a practicing Catholic,President Biden has been an inconsistent supporter of abortion rightsbut has moderated his views over time.",
