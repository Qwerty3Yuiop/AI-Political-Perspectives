Nord Stream 2 was scheduled to begin flowing oil this year, but Germany scrapped the project in retaliation for Russia's attack. Nord Stream 1 was shut down in August after Moscow announced it needed repairs, however Western nations widely suspected this was a political move to punish them for supporting Ukraine\u2019s resistance.There is no clear suspect in the pipeline sabotage.Ukrainian officials were quick to blame Moscow, claiming that Russia sought to destabilize Western Europe, which is already struggling with rising energy costs.
