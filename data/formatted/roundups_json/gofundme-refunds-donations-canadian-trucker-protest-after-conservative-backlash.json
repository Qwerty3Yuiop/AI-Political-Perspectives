    "summary": "GoFundMe has decided toautomatically refundthe $10 million of donations they retracted from the Canadian truckersleading a protest against the country's vaccine mandates.The crowdfunding platform initially\u00a0shut down the campaign to support the convoy, citing\u00a0\"law enforcement reports of violence and other unlawful activity.\" GoFundMe announced in\u00a0atweeton Saturday morning that\u00a0they \"will be refunding all donations to the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser\" within seven to 10 business days.\u00a0GoFundMe's initial decision to terminate the campaign promptly sparked criticism from many conservative voices within Canada and the U.S. The \"Freedom Convoy\" of Canadian truckers is said to have grossed more money than any major Canadian\u00a0political party\u00a0during the last quarter of 2021.The GoFundMe story was covered prominently across the spectrum, especially by right-rated outlets. Many left-rated outlets emphasized how\u00a0the Canadian truckers violated the GoFundMe rules, some of which were\u00a0reported to have \"harassed people at a homeless shelter, vandalized war memorials, waved racist flags, and forced businesses to shut down because of maskless protesters.\" Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight conservative voices that criticized the platform's actions like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who said that he would \"investigate\" the company.",
