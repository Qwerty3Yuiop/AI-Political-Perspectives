    "summary": "Russia\u00a0blocked access to Facebook, Twitter\u00a0and several foreign news sites on Friday. Russia's Parliament also passed new restrictions on contradicting Moscow's war narrative.The new restrictions ban spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d about the Russian military and \u201cdiscrediting\u201d Russia\u2019s use of military force in Ukraine, with penalties including up to 15 years in prison. Those restrictions appeared to \u201ccriminalize the process of independent journalism,\u201d BBC Director-General Tim Davie said in astatement.BBC News (Center)was among several foreign news sites blocked in Russia; others includedVoice of America(Center),Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty(Not Rated) and German outletDeutche Welle(Center). Regarding the Facebook ban, Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor cited 26 purported examples of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against Russian media outlets. In response, Meta global affairs president Nick Cleggwarnedthat \u201cmillions of ordinary Russians\u201d would be \u201csilenced from speaking out.\u201dCoverage was widespread and prominently featured across the spectrum on Friday. Coverage on both sides was often openly critical of Russia\u2019s actions. The story prompted several examples of sensationalism, including a headline calling the Russian law \u201cdraconian\u201d inMarketWatch (Center)and a \u201cPUTIN'S PURGE\u201d homepage tagline inFox News (Right).",
