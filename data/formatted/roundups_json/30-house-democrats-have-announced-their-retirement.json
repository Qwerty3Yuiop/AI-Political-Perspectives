    "summary": "Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice (N.Y.) announced her retirement this week, becoming the 30th\u00a0House Democrat\u00a0to\u00a0retire\u00a0ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.This marks the most Democratic retirements since 1992, when 41 retired.The exoduscomes as Democrats face\u00a0the historical trend of the president's party\u00a0losing congressional\u00a0seats in midterm elections.\u00a0By comparison, only 13 Republicans have announced their retirement, which would be the party's lowest total since 1988 if no others depart.Coverage across the spectrum framed Rice's retirement as a bad sign for Democrats' chances in the midterms and as good news for Republicans. One source interviewed by CNN attributed the string of Democratic retirements to \"a combination of January 6th, a lack of civility, plus a frustration with a fact that most legislation is leadership driven instead of member driven.\"",
