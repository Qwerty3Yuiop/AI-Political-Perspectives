    "summary": "Following reports thatRussian opposition party leader Alexei Navalny died Friday, voices across the spectrum are reflecting on what his death means for Russia.From the Left:A writer in theDaily Beast (Left bias)praised Navalny for returning to Russia in 2021 after he was poisoned by the Russian security services, writing that he \u201ctruly believed in Russia, in the possibility of a democratic nation rising from the ruins of the Soviet empire.\u201d The writer concluded, \u201cToday, a Russia free of Putin and Putinism seems almost impossible to imagine. But for the sake of Navalny, we must imagine it.\u201dFrom the Center:Anne Applebaum (Center bias)explained the power of Navalny, describing how he \u201cseemed real to other ordinary Russians, and he told stories that had relevance to their lives.\u201d Applebaum determined this appeal led the Russian government to kill Navalny, writing, \u201cEven behind bars Navalny was a real threat to Putin, because he was living proof that courage is possible, that truth exists, that Russia could be a different kind of country.\u201dFrom the Right:The National Review Editorial Board (Right bias)called Navalny \u201cone of the bravest men of our time,\u201d writing that he \u201cunderstood the power of humor, and found creative ways to lampoon Russia\u2019s ruling party as a clique of thieves and crooks.\u201d The board concluded, \u201cYou often hear that Vladimir Putin, no matter what, loves his country. Yet he robs it blind. He immiserates it. True love of country was shown by Navalny.\u201d",
