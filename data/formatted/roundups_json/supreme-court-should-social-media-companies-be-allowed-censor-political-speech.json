    "headline": "Supreme Court Should Social Media Companies Be Allowed Censor Political Speech",
    "summary": "The future of online speech is being scrutinized by the Supreme Court as it hears two landmark cases.For Context:These lawsuits arose out of Florida and Texas laws enacted in 2021, which restrict tech companies' ability to censor political content they find objectionable. Advocates argue they shield the First Amendment rights of users, particularly conservatives, from what they consider to be left-leaning tech companies' bias. The tech industry argues these laws infringe upon their editorial discretion and thus their First Amendment rights. A key part of this debate is whether online platforms should be treated and regulated like newspapers, which have editorial discretion, or like the communications infrastructure provided by telephone companies.From the Left:A writer in theLos Angeles Times (Lean Left bias)argued that if these laws are upheld, it would significantly worsen the internet and social media. The writer deemed the argument that social media platforms disproportionately censor conservative content to be \u201ca widely promoted but unfounded perception\u201d and concluded that these platforms \u201chave a 1st Amendment right to decide what speech to convey.\u201dFrom the Right:TheWall Street Journal Editorial Board (Lean Right bias)argued that Republicans are \u201crightly frustrated by censorship that often tilts against conservatives,\u201d but sided against the legal argument, writing, \u201cthe solution to business censorship of conservatives isn\u2019t government censorship of business.\u201d The board concluded, \u201cit never turns out well for conservatives, or anyone else, when the supposed remedy is giving government more power to control speech.\u201dThis summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.",
