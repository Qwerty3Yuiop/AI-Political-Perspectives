Another six annual funding bills associated with the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, the Pentagon, and other offices, will extend funding through March 22. The extended deadlines offer negotiators additional time and flexibility for spending talks and drafting.Key Quotes:\u201cWe are in agreement that Congress must work in a bipartisan manner to fund our government,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement on Wednesday.For Context:The bills haven't yet been officially passed due to ongoing political disputes and procedural issues.
