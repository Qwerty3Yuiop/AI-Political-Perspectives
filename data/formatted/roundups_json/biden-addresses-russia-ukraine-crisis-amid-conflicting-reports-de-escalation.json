    "summary": "President Joe Biden issued an address on the Russia-Ukraine crisis Tuesday amidconflicting reports about Russia's plans to invadethe former Soviet territory.Biden said a Russian\u00a0invasion is still \"distinctly possible\" and described\u00a0how the U.S. and allies are \"ready to impose powerful sanctions and export controls\" in response to an invasion. He said that the U.S. wouldn't send troops to Ukraine, but had \"supplied the Ukrainian military equipment to help them defend themselves.\" Biden also recalled how Russians and the U.S. fought together in World War II and said, \"To the citizens of Russia, you are not our enemy.\" Putin said Tuesday thatsome Russian troops had recently withdrawn from the Ukrainian border, and that he was ready to re-enter security negotiations with the U.S. and NATO; Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. hadn't yet confirmed the troop withdrawal.Coverage from right-rated outlets often highlighted how Biden said\u00a0he would not send U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, with some framing that as encouragement for Russia to invade. Reports from left- and center-rated sources typically focused more on the lack of verification for Putin's claim about withdrawing troops, and framed Biden as having emphasized a path toward diplomacy and de-escalation.",
