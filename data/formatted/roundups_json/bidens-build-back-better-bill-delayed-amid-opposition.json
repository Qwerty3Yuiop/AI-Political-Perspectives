    "summary": "Stalled negotiations between President Joe Biden and a key centrist Democrat will likely delay passage ofBiden's $1.75\u00a0trillion spending planuntil 2022.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a moderate Democrat, has for months been one of the bill's prominent detractors, and his reservations about the spending plan were a primary reason for its pricetag beingcut down from the original $3.5 trillion proposal. Multiple sources cited across the spectrum described the negotiations between Biden and Manchin as \"far apart.\" On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will \"continue working on getting the Senate in a position where we can vote on the President's Build Back Better legislation,\" but did not mention his goal of passing it by\u00a0Christmas as he had in other recent statements. Democrats may reportedly shift focus to passing new voting rights legislation while the spending bill impasse persists.Outlets across the spectrum covered the news and highlighted other obstacles to the bill, such as disagreement among Democrats about expanded Medicare provisions and climate change spending. Reports from right-rated sources often framed the spending plan as excessive and focused onRepublicans' criticismsof it; someused the Congressional Budget Office's $3 trillion estimateto describe the bill's cost instead of the $1.75 trillion figure.",
