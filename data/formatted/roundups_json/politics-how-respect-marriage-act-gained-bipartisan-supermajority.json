    "headline": "Politics How Respect Marriage Act Gained Bipartisan Supermajority",
    "summary": "The Senate voted 61-36 Tuesday to pass theRespect for Marriage Act. Twelve Republican senators joined the 50 Democrats to advancethe billthat would codify same-sex and interracial marriage on a federal level. The bipartisan coalition that pushed forward the bill came about as aresult of balancingthe Democratic effort to enshrine marriage equality into law with the Republican effort to ensure the protection of religious liberties and state rights.For Context:In 2015, the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage, but until now there was no federal legislation to support the precedent set by the court. Since the Obergefell decision, a number of cases have gone to the Supreme Court based around the conflict between marriage equality and religious freedoms.What The Bill Does:The Respect for Marriage Act recognizes same-sex and interracial marriage on the federal level. It replaces the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited same-sex marriage. The act makes it so a marriage certificate of a same-sex or interracial couple from a state where it\u2019s legal must be recognized in a state where it\u2019s not legal.What The Bill Doesn\u2019t Do:The Respect for Marriage Act does not make same-sex and interracial marriage legal in all states, and would not require states that prohibit\u00a0same-sex marriage to allow it, even if the Supreme Court did overturn the Obergefell decision. The bill does not require religious non-profits to recognize and provide services to same-sex couples.",
