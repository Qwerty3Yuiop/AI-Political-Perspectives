    "summary": "The Biden administration is expected to recommend COVID-19\u00a0booster shots after eight\u00a0months for most Americans.\u00a0 The recommendation could come as early as this week, and the boosters could be administered sometime in September, pending FDA approval.Federal heath officials have been considering this recommendation after reportedly looking at preliminary studies from other countries that\u00a0suggest\u00a0the vaccine's protection against serious illness drops off after eight\u00a0months. The World Health Organization and other global\u00a0health authorities have on more-vaccinated and wealthier countries to hold off on booster shots until third-world countries have received the first dose of the vaccine; the U.S.\u00a0has shared more than 100 million vaccine doses.",
