    "headline": "Immigration Immigration Court Backlog Hits 3 Million Migrants Released Court Dates Years Away",
    "summary": "The U.S. immigration court system now has a backlog of over 3 million cases, asmigrants continue to arrive in record numbersand authorities struggle to keep up with the influx.The Details:Data from theTracImmigrationproject at Syracuse University\u00a0shows the backlog of cases has surpassed\u00a03 million, with each judge in the system being assigned roughly 4,500 cases.\u00a0When unauthorized immigrants are processed, they receive\u00a0a court date to appear for the next step in their case before being released. Amid the backlog, many of those dates are several years away.For Context:The backlog was around\u00a02 million at this time last year and hit 1 million for the first time in Sept. 2019. On average,\u00a0between 50,000 and 100,000 cases were added to the backlog each\u00a0quarter from 2016 to 2021. Nearly 400,000 cases were added in the third quarter of 2023, and the Q4 total is expected to be near 450,000.How the Media Covered it:Center- and right-rated sources blamed a lack of resources, including border agents and judges, for the backlog overflow.\u00a0As of this writing, no left-rated outlets have mentioned the record-high court backlog.Why the Difference?Media\u00a0on the right and in the center are generally more concerned about illegal immigration than media on the left are, and they're quicker to highlight how the system has become more strained under the Biden administration.",
