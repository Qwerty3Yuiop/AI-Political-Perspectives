    "summary": "The January 6 committee's hearings culminated Monday in a symboliccriminal referral of former President Donald Trumpto the Department of Justice over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot. What will be the committee's legacy?What the Right Said:Right-rated voices often framed the criminal referrals as irrelevant and proof of the panel's partisan bias.National Review's (Right bias)Andrew C. McCarthy wrote that the referrals would only act as \"Exhibit A in Trump\u2019s defense that any indictment is sheer partisan politics.\"\u00a0Trumpwroteon his Truth Social profile that \"people who love freedom rally around me\" when Democrats \"come after me.\"Fox News (Right bias)highlighted\"legal experts\" who said the referrals \"will likely be ignored by the DOJ, and they could possibly have a counterproductive effect should the DOJ decide to bring charges.\"What the Left Said:Left-rated voices often praised the committee as courageous and essential in the wake of Jan. 6. The Washington Post's Editorial Board said the panel \"secured its legacy\" by \"providing a searing picture of what occurred on Jan. 6, 2021, and exhibiting the cowardice of those who, out of fear of Mr. Trump, refused to help it reckon with that dark day.\" OneCNN (Left bias)opinion writercalledthe referrals \"devastating\" for Trump. OneBoston Globe (Left bias)columnistcalledon the DOJ to indict Trump, or else \"this nation\u2019s unhealed wounds, steeped in history\u2019s sorrows, will continue to fester and weep.\"",
