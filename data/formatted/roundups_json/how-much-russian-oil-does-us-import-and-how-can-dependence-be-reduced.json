    "summary": "Russia's war on Ukraine has made gas prices in the U.S. even higher, and many are now questioning America's relationship with\u00a0Russia when it comes to energy imports.Three percent of the roughly 209,000 oil barrels the\u00a0U.S. imported per day\u00a0in 2021\u00a0came from Russia, ranking\u00a0fourth behind Canada (61%), Mexico (10%) and Saudi Arabia (6%) as the U.S.'s biggest sources of oil imports.\u00a0This has led to criticisms of\u00a0the U.S. for paying for Russian oil, andprominent lawmakers in both major partiessupport banning\u00a0Russian oil imports.\u00a0Meanwhile, U.S. oil traders are reportedlyslowing down imports of Russian oil. Experts on both sides have also accused theJones Act of 1920of making\u00a0energy prices higher while incentivizing the U.S. to rely more on energy imports. The law\u00a0requires water transportation of cargo among U.S. ports to be conducted solely by registered American ships with U.S. crews.Many across the spectrum agreed that total U.S. energy independence is unachievable, but left and right split on how to avoid dependence on Russian oil. Many right-rated voices called for U.S. imports of Russian oil to end immediately, and for Biden to ease restrictions on\u00a0drilling in the U.S. to offset the loss and boost energy independence. Left-rated voices typically focused on shifting attention to cleaner energy sources as a way to both stop depending on Russian oil and\u00a0help the environment.",
