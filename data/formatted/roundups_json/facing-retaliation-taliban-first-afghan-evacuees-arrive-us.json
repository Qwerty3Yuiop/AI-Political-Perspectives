The evacuees will complete a special visa application process created\u00a0followingthe end of U.S. military operationsin the country earlier this month. About 2,500 people will be taken to the U.S. as part of the program, and another 4,000 will reportedly be evacuated to third countries or overseas\u00a0U.S. military bases. The Taliban has reportedly already beguntargeting and executing people accused of helping the U.S. military.There were few notable divides in coverage across the spectrum. Most sources laid out the facts with little to nospin or slant, regardless of their bias rating; many put a special focus on the dangers the interpreters\u00a0face back home.",
