Puffin Books and the Dahl estate should be ashamed.\u201d Within the revised editions, a note from the publisher states, \u201cThis book was written many years ago, and so we regularly review the language to ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today.\u201d A statement from the Roald Dahl Story Company said it was \u201cnot unusual to review the language used,\u201d adding, \u201cOur guiding principle throughout has been to maintain the storylines, characters, and the irreverence and sharp-edged spirit of the original text. Any changes made have been small and carefully considered.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:Coverage was widespread across the spectrum, with articles generally covering both sides of the issue. Left-rated outlets were somewhat more likely to mention accusations of antisemitism against Dahl. Some coverage from the right displayed hostility toward the revisions by highlighting critics\u2019 arguments and saying \u201csensitive\u201d or\u201cwoke\u201deditors had \u201cscrubbed\u201d Dahl\u2019s \u201cbeloved\u201d books.",
