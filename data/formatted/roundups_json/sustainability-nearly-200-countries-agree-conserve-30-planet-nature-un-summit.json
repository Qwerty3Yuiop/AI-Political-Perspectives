    "summary": "Representatives from almost 200 nations agreed to set a target of conserving 30% of the Earth\u2019s surface for nature by 2030 at theUnited Nations\u2019 COP15 biodiversity summitin Montreal, Canada.Key Facts:The global targets for 2030 alsoincludedinvesting at least $200 billion per year from both public and private sources, eliminating at least $500 billion per year in subsidies harmful to biodiversity, restoring 30% of degraded ecosystems, reducing risk from pesticides by at least 50%, and reducing the rate of introduction and establishment of invasive alien species by at least 50%. The countries also set a goal of stopping the extinction of known species and reducing the extinction risk of all species to 10% of current levels.For Context:While the agreement is not a guarantee that targets will be met, it represents a major commitment, with some officials comparing it to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. However, the United States could not join the agreement because it is\u00a0not a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which congressional Republicans have blocked. Species and ecosystems face\u00a0mounting challenges worldwide;\u00a0recent studies have found that North America has lost about29%of its birds since 1970,\u00a0withone in eightbird species facing extinction worldwide.How the Media Covered It:While coverage was common in major left and center-rated outlets Monday morning, it was mostly absent from right-rated outlets, which tend to focus less on international stories. Many headlines called the agreement \u201chistoric,\u201d sometimes quoting diplomats who used the same language.",
