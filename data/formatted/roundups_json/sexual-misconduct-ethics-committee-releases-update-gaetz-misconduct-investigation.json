    "summary": "The House Ethics Committee released an update on its continued investigation of alleged misconduct by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) involving illicit drug use, sexual misconduct, and improper gifts to individuals.The Details:The Ethics Committee's update appears to clarify recent news reports about the probe, noting that despite challenges in obtaining information from Gaetz and others, they had issued 25 subpoenas, reviewed thousands of documents, and interviewed over a dozen witnesses. One woman,ABC News (Lean Left bias)reported, \u201ctold the committee that a payment from Gaetz was for sex,\u201d while other women said the payment was for attending parties \u201cthat featured drugs and sex.\u201dFor Context:Gaetz has continually denied the allegations, including those of paying for sex with a minor, and has previously called them part of an effort to recategorize his generosity towards his ex-girlfriends as something more untoward. Gaetz previously blamed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) for orchestrating continued scrutiny of his conduct.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was common across the spectrum on Tuesday and Wednesday, often similarly highlighting the alleged sexual misconduct and Gaetz\u2019s denial of wrongdoing. Some coverage exhibited partisan differences;Fox News (Right bias)put \u201csexual misconduct\u201d in quotes and highlighted Gaetz\u2019s denial in its tagline, while theDaily Beast (Left bias)used the word \u201cteenagers\u201d instead of \u201cminors,\u201d making the allegations sound more salacious.This summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.",
