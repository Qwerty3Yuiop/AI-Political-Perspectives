    "summary": "Democratic governors in four states \u2014\u00a0Oregon, Delaware, New Jersey, and Connecticut \u2014\u00a0recently made plans to end statewide mask mandates for schools.The changes come as cases of the Omicron variant fall substantially from record highs, and as more Democratic leaders seek to end politically-fraught mandates.\u00a0 The CDC has not spoken out against the states'\u00a0decisions, but stillrecommends masking for students and faculty in K-12 schools. Not all states are ending mandates; a New York\u00a0Health Department spokeswoman said this week that the state's mandate for schools\u00a0\"is expected to be renewed\" later this month.",
