    "summary": "What\u2019s causing the recent spike in illegal immigration, and how can politicians address the problem?For Context:Border Patrol\u2019s encounters with illegal border crossings havesharply risen since the summer, and the immigration court system reportedly has abacklog of over 3 million cases.Legalize Immigration:A writer in theDaily Beast (Left bias)attributed immigration issues to \u201crestrictionist policies\u201d that make it difficult for migrants to enter the country legally, which then fuels calls for stricter policies. \u201cImmigration restrictionists create the problems and then demand ever more restrictions to fix them. Lather, rinse, repeat.\u201d The writer pushes for increased legal pathways for migrants to enter the country, concluding, \u201cLet people come and work legally and contribute to this great country, just as immigrants have for centuries. That\u2019s the border plan of America\u2019s founders. It was our tradition for most of our history.\u201dUnsustainable Regulations:A writer in theNational Review (Right bias)blamed \u201cunsustainable\u201d regulations enacted by the Biden Administration on American farmers as causing an increase in illegal immigration. These regulations increase the pay and paperwork required for farmers to hire seasonal workers, leading some farmers to bypass these regulations by hiring illegal immigrants to fill these roles, which the writer determines leads to an increase in illegal immigration as it becomes known that this additional work is available. The writer concludes that the process of hiring seasonal workers must be streamlined, concluding, \u201canything would be better than Biden\u2019s current policy of exacerbating a national crisis.\u201d",
