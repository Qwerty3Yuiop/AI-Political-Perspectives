    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday disputed that the Hurricane Maria death toll in Puerto Rico reached 3,000, blaming Democrats for exaggerating the number to make him look \"as bad as possible\". Some have criticized Trump for diverging from the recent study conducted by George Washington University, while others have questioned the veracity of the college's findings, particularly since the evaluation includes some fatalities that occurred six months after the storm.",
