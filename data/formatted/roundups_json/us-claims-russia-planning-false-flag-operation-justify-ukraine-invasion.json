    "summary": "U.S. intelligence officials are suggesting\u00a0that\u00a0Russian operatives are\u00a0planning\u00a0a \"false-flag\" operation that would allow Moscow to rationalize an\u00a0invasion of Ukraine.White House press secretary\u00a0Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday that Russia was going to accuse\u00a0Ukraine of planning a preeminent attack by having Russian operatives stage a series of fabricated\u00a0\"sabotage attacks.\"\u00a0Russia has since dismissed the claims. The Biden administration haswarned\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putinthat the U.S. would respond with \"strong economic and other measures\u00a0in the event of military escalation.\" Approximately 100,000 Russian troops remain near the Ukrainian border, as Russian officials saidlast week's security talks with the U.S.hit a \"dead end.\"Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to frame the U.S. disclosing \"specific intelligence determinations\" as unusual. Some right-rated voices such asJohn Bolton (Lean Right bias)suggested that the U.S. and NATO must \"urgently develop strategies\" to combat Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.",
