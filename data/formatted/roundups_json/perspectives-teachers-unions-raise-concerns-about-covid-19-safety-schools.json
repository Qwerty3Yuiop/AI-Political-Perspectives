Classes had been canceled for four straight days amid concerns about surging COVID-19 cases and a lack of access to tests. Many\u00a0teachers' unions are also saying that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has been facingbipartisan criticismfor\"confusing\"\u00a0COVID-19 protocols, has\u00a0not been \"communicating well enough\u00a0with educators.\"Left-rated voices were more likely to criticize\u00a0the effectiveness of COVID-related government regulations, with one writer arguing that the\u00a0Chicago Teachers' Union always wanted to return to in-person learning but \"the city\u2019s lackluster pandemic safety\" prevented that.Bloomberg's\u00a0(Lean Left bias)editorial board\u00a0believes Democrats need to \"break the grip\" of teachers' unions on\u00a0the public school system.\" Right-rated voiceshave long criticized teachers' unionsfor using \"political clout to stifle innovations\u00a0that could improve U.S. education.\" One opinion piece fromFox News (Right bias)argued thatfunding students directly\"would empower families to access educational alternatives\" and that more data will soon reveal\u00a0\"the academic, social, and emotional costs\" of virtual learning for young children.",
