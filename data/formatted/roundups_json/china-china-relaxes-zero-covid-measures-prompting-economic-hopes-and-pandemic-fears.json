China also substantially relaxed a QR code system enforcing whether people could enter public spaces. Covid-positive patients with no or mild symptoms will now be allowed to quarantine at home instead of at a government facility.Economic Hopes:Stocks rose worldwide in response to the news.The Wall Street Journal (Center bias)reported Thursday that China\u2019s decision was in part motivated by a letter from the founder of Foxconn, who warned that China\u2019s place in global supply chains was at risk.Pandemic Fears:Since lockdowns kept many in China from getting infected, some worry that China\u2019s population is now vulnerable to a surge in cases. Feng Zijian, former deputy director of China\u2019s CDC, warned that the initial wave could infect 60% of China\u2019s population \u2014 about 850 million people.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was widespread across the spectrum in the days following the announcement. By Thursday, however, coverage in some left and center-rated outlets shifted to concerns about a potential virus surge; a headline inThe Economist (Lean Left bias)said the move carried \u201cgreat risk.\u201d Coverage generally described the event as noteworthy, withFox News (Right bias)including \u201cBEIJING BACKS DOWN\u201d in a headline.",
