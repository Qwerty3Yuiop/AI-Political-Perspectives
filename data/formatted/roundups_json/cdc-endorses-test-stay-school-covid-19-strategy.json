    "summary": "On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed a \u201ctest to stay\u201d policy allowing close contacts of students with COVID-19\u00a0to continue in-person schooling if they test negative.The CDC released two studies showing the effectiveness of the strategy, which some schools across the country had already implemented. Instead of quarantining unvaccinated students who come in contact with an infected person, \u201ctest to stay\u201d allows asymptomatic students who test negative twice in a 7-day period to continue in-person schooling. Those who test positive, however, would still be required to isolate. \u201cTest-to-Stay is another valuable tool in a layered prevention strategy that includes promoting vaccination of eligible students and staff,\u201d aCDC statementsaid.Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Friday. Coverage in some right-rated outlets highlighted recent school closures.",
