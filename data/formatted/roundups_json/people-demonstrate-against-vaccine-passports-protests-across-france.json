    "headline": "People Demonstrate Against Vaccine Passports Protests Across France",
    "summary": "Over the last four weekends, thousands of protesters have rallied in the streets across France to revolt against President Emmanuel Macron's new vaccine passport mandate. The health bill, which goes into effect tomorrow, will require all French citizens to show proof of vaccination before\u00a0entering cafes, restaurants, public transportation and certain health facilities. The law was already in effect for cultural and recreational venues with a capacity for more than 50 people. While there has been little opposition to wearing face masks, many French citizens believe the bill infringes the most fundamental of French principles: the libert\u00e9 (freedom) and egalit\u00e9 (equality) of the national motto. Macron asked his people to consider the third element of the motto, fraternit\u00e9 (fraternity), and to \u201caccept these collective rules \u2026 and get vaccinated.\u201d Many other European countries such as Italy, Denmark, Germany and Austria have introduced COVID-19 passes, each with different rules. While the U.S. and Canada have no current plans to implement a federal vaccine mandate, certain areas like New York City and Quebec have moved forward with their own requirements.Right-rated outlets were more likely to include quotes from protesters; left-rated outlets featured more quotes from Macron and health officials. Left-rated outlets were also more likely to link back to polls that report\u00a0most people in France support the vaccine passport. Some right-rated outlets referred to COVID-19 as the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus.",
