He said\u00a0it would have been political not to cut rates when they are so high, and \"If the members of the Fed committee had really wanted to help the Democrat get elected, they would have started cutting earlier, since it takes\u00a0at least half a year, and possibly much longer, for changes in interest rates to affect the real economy.\"For Context:The Fed takes pride in its independent decision-making.
