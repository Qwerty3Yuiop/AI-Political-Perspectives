    "summary": "During a town hall event this week, presidential candidate Nikki Haley was asked what caused the Civil War. Haleycaught flak across the spectrumfor not mentioning slavery in her answer. She later added, \u201cOf course the Civil War was about slavery.\u201d Why did she leave this out of her initial answer, and what does this reveal about her candidacy?Contempt for Voters?Jeffrey Blehar (Lean Right bias)determined that Haley\u2019s \u201cgaffe\u201d was not a result of racism or a desire to rewrite history but instead her \u201ccontempt for the intelligence of her voters.\u201d Blehar argued that Haley opted to dodge the question because she did not think Republican voters could handle an honest answer. Blehar concluded, \u201cwe rarely get such accidental insight into how little politicians think of their own voters.\u201dWishy-washy?Matt Lewis (Center bias)said Haley\u2019s answer \u201creinforces some negative perceptions that many of us have long had about Haley\u2019s character.\u201d Lewis argued that Haley is \u201cwishy-washy.\u201d Addressing the possibility that Haley thought mentioning slavery wouldn\u2019t play well with her Republican audience, Lewis determined she \u201cwould have been just fine by telling the truth.\u201dContested History?A writer in theNew York Times Opinion (Left bias)broke down how a decades-long disagreement over the institution of slavery divided the nation and culminated in the Civil War.
