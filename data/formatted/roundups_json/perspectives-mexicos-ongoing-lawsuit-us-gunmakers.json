    "summary": "The Mexican government filed a federal lawsuit against 10 U.S.\u00a0gun manufacturers and distributors on Aug. 4 in Massachusetts federal court, accusing the companies\u00a0of \"actively facilitating\" the trafficking of those weapons to \"drug cartels and other criminals in Mexico.\"The Mexican government is\u00a0seeking up to $10 billion from gun manufacturers, saying\u00a0at least 17,000 homicides were linked to trafficked weapons in 2019. According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives,about 70% of guns found\u00a0in\u00a0Mexicoand submitted for tracing from\u00a02014\u00a0through\u00a02018 originated in the U.S. Mexico\u00a0hasstrict lawsaround gun sales for private use. Given that, some Americans have made a profit by legally purchasing\u00a0guns and then re-selling them to Mexican trafficking organizations for high prices.Most voices across the spectrum agreed that the lawsuit would be an uphill battle for the Mexican government. Many left-rated voices believe that the case\u00a0could help decrease gun violence both in the U.S. and Mexico, arguing that the 2nd Amendment has been protecting these gun manufacturers\u00a0and that the law needs to be updated. Right-rated voices were more likely to take the stance that the Mexican government is blaming the unchecked crime and corruption in their country on \"law-abiding firearm manufacturers\" in the U.S.",
