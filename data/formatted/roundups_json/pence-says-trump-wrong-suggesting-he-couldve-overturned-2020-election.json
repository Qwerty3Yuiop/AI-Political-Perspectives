    "summary": "Former Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech on Friday that he\u00a0had no legal authority to change the outcome of the 2020 election, rebuking the claim\u00a0made by former President Donald Trump.\"President Trump is wrong,\"\u00a0Pence said during\u00a0his speech at a Federalist Society event in Florida.\u00a0\"Frankly there is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.\" Pence's recent comments are\u00a0the strongest rejection of Trump\u2019s efforts to change the results of the 2020 election,\u00a0which he has kept relatively quiet on since Joe Biden took over as president. The former vice president, wholaunched a conservative advocacy grouplast\u00a0April,\u00a0also suggested that the Republican Party would take back the White House in\u00a02024. Trumpreleased a \"fiery\" statementon Friday night in response to Pence's comments, calling the former vice president \u201can automatic conveyor belt\u201d for the \"Old Crow\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0to get Biden elected President \"as quickly as possible.\"Pence's comments were prominently covered across the spectrum, with most outlets emphasizing how Trump and Pence's relationship has\u00a0\"soured\" inthe year since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Some left-rated outlets noted how Pence \"stopped short of completely breaking\" off from Trump's base, which remains a large portion of the Republican Party. Many right-rated voices such asNational Review (Right bias)expressed how\u00a0it was \"good\" to\u00a0see Pence criticize\u00a0Trump \"forcefully and by name,\" highlighting how the former vice president's\u00a0\"commitment to the U.S. Constitution and deep faith\u00a0made him do the right thing in the face of tremendous pressure.\"",
