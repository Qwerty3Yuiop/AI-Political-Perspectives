    "headline": "Biden Signs Bill Extending Government Spending Hours Deadline",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden signed a short-term stopgap\u00a0bill on Thursday to extend government spending through Dec. 3, hours ahead of\u00a0a potential government shutdown. The measure passed in the Senate with bipartisan support,\u00a065-35, after Democrats removed a\u00a0proposal to raise the country\u2019s debt ceiling.\u00a0The bill\u00a0will maintain federal agencies' spending, provide\u00a0$28.6 billion to communities that are rebuilding from recent natural disasters, and allocate $6.3 billion to assist Afghan refugees establish new lives in the US. The House\u00a0passed the bill with a 254-175 vote later Thursday ahead of the midnight deadline.\u00a0Lawmakers will now shift their focus towards suspending the debt ceiling and subsequently avoiding a government shutdown before Oct. 18,a motion that was blocked by Senate Republicans on Monday.Coverage was prominent across the political spectrum. Some left-rated outlets highlighted the Republicans who voted agaist it; some center- and right-rated outlets framed the Senate and Hosue votes as bipartisan. Left-rated voices remained critical of Senate Republicans who are\"refusing\u00a0to give the majority party any of the votes needed to move ahead on a bill to avert a first-ever federal default.\"Right-rated outlets were more likely to emphasize how\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \"applauded the clean legislation,\" but doubled down on his claim that \"Republicans will not assist Democrats in raising the debt ceiling.\"Updated at 10:08pm ET 9/30/21 with news of Biden's signature.",
