    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that the U.S. and other European countries hadn't adequately considered Russia's concerns and demands regarding Ukraine.Putin alleged that \"fundamental Russian concerns were ignored\" by the U.S. and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He also claimed that the most important objective for the U.S. \"is to contain Russia\u2019s development,\" while adding\u00a0his \"hope that we will eventually find a solution\" to the Ukraine tensions. Russia\u00a0wants\u00a0NATO to exclude Ukraine from membership and agree to\u00a0withdraw forces from Eastern Europe and\u00a0refrain from deploying weapons near the Russian border. Putin's remarks followed aheated U.N. Security Council meetingMonday between American and Russian diplomats.\u00a0\u00a0The State Department said\u00a0Monday that it received a follow-up from Russia\u00a0to a U.S. proposal sent last week\u00a0onhow to defuse tensions and hold more negotiationsin response to Russia's demands. Russia has more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine\u2019s borders, and theU.S. and NATO have warned of a potential invasion soon.Putin's comments were covered prominently across the spectrum Tuesday. Some right-rated outlets framed Putin's criticisms as being more accusatory and critical of the U.S. position. Reports from left- and center-rated sources more often highlighted Putin's expressed intent to eventually find a non-violent solution and pledge that Russia will not start a war over Ukraine.",
