    "summary": "The U.S. experienced a 29.4 percent\u00a0increase in murders in\u00a02020 compared to the previous year, marking the largest spike since national records were instituted\u00a0in 1960. According to new figures released Monday by the FBI,there were an estimated\u00a021,570 homicides in the United States last year\u2014 4,901 more than recorded in 2019. Preliminary data also suggests that the murder rate has continued to grow in 2021, but has slowed down as the year progresses.\u00a0Several cities across the midwest such as\u00a0Albuquerque, Des Moines, Memphis and Milwaukee logged their highest homicide rate ever. Although the FBI noted\u00a0an overall 5.6 percent\u00a0increase in overall violent crimes, 2020 marked the 18th consecutive year where property crimes have declined.\u00a0Since 2,722\u00a0of the eligible 18,619 law enforcement agencies didn't submit\u00a0their numbers to the FBI last year, the data remains\u00a0incomplete.Numbers and data stayed consistent\u00a0across the spectrum, withsome outlets comparing the murder rates to other countries. Right-rated outlets were more likely to emphasize the George Floyd \"riots\" andthe \"drop in morale among law enforcement\" as the\u00a0main agent\u00a0of violence. Some left-rated voicescalled last year an \"aberration,\"indicating that these increasing numbers are \"not indicative of a longer-term trend.\"",
