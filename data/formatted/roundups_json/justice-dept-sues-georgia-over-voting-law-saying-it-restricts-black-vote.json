    "summary": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday that it is suing the state of Georgia over itsnew voting law. \"Georgia enacted S.B. 202 with knowledge of the disproportionate effect that numerous provisions, both singly and together, would have on Black voters\u2019 ability to participate in the political process on an equal basis with white voters,\" the lawsuit states. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) argues that the law expands voter access throughout the state, and says the DOJ lawsuit was \"born out of the lies and misinformation the Biden administration has pushed against Georgia\u2019s Election Integrity Act.\" The law, enacted in March, enhances requirements for absentee voting and limits the number of ballot drop boxes per county.Coverage from left-rated outlets often framed Georgia's law as discriminatory, and described it as a consequence of former President Donald Trump's false 2020 election claims. Reports from right-rated sources tended to focus on criticism of the DOJ lawsuit, including from Trump.",
