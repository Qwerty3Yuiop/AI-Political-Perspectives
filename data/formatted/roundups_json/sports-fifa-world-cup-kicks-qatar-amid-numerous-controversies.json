    "summary": "The FIFA World Cup kicked off today in Qatar. It is the first time the tournament is being held in a Middle Eastern country, and the lead up to the tournament has been mired in controversy regarding corruption, alleged human rights abuses of migrant workers that constructed the stadiums, and alleged persecution of the gay community of Qatar.Key Quotes:On Saturday, FIFA president Gianni Infantino accused Western nations and media of hypocrisy for bringing light to controversies surrounding the tournament, stating, \u201cI think for what we Europeans have been doing the last 3,000 years we should be apologizing for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.\u201d A writer in theNew York Times (Lean Left Bias)characterizedInfantino\u2019s frustrationas \u201csomehow fitting, too. This is a tournament, after all, where almost everyone appears to be unhappy.\u201dFor Context:The FIFA World Cup is held every four years. The last World Cup, in 2018, was won by France. The United States has never won a World Cup. The U.S. Department of Justiceindictednine FIFA officials and five corporate executives on charges of racketeering, conspiracy and corruption in 2015.How the Media Covered It:Coverage leading up to the World Cup was focused nearly exclusively on the controversies surrounding the event. As the tournament kicks off, coverage is shifting to focus on the sport instead of the surrounding drama.",
