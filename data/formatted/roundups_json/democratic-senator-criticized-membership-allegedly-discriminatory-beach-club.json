    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse\u00a0received criticism this week for defending his membership to an exclusive Rhode Island Beach club that some claim have discriminatory policies against people of color. Ina Friday\u00a0interview with local news site\u00a0GoLocal Providence, Whitehouse was asked if\u00a0club had admitted any minorities\u00a0since 2017, whenGoLocal first posed the question. \u201cI think the people who are running the place are still working on that and I\u2019m sorry it hasn't happened yet,\" Whitehouse replied. \u201cIt's a long tradition in Rhode Island and there are many of them and I think we just need to work our way through the issues.\"GoLocal also reportedthat Whitehouse pledged to leave the club in 2006 when he ran for the Senate. A spokesperson for the senator\u00a0said Monday that the beach club\u00a0has no\u00a0\"restrictive policy\u201d surrounding race or ethnicity.In 2003 the\u00a0New York Times described Bailey's Beach Club, also known as\u00a0Spouting Rock Beach Association,\u00a0as a place for America's \u201cruling class,\" with members such as the Vanderbilt family and the Astor family.Some on the left accused\u00a0Whitehouse of hypocrisy for advocating for racial equality in the Senate, yet belonging to a purportedly discriminatory club; many reports from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted the claim that the club doesn't allow minorities. Someright-rated outletsclaimed that Whitehouse would be criticized much more harshly if he were a Republican instead of a Democrat.",
