Stephens said Affirmative Action has deeply damaged academia\u2019s reputation and argued that \u201cstatus without excellence is a rapidly wasting asset.\u201d He added that respect for academia among \u201cordinary people\u201d has been erased and that institutions should aim to \u201cliberate the best minds, not to engineer social utopias.\u201dOpportunistic Firing:An opinion forThe Forward (Center bias)said Gay\u2019s \u201cplagiarism kerfuffle\u201d will soon be forgotten, but her angering of \u201crich pro-Israel donors, as well as opportunistic activists and politicians\u201d will not be, which should be \u201cchilling.\u201d The writer added that American Jews, who understandably feel vulnerable, are now \u201cswept up in a moral panic\u201d where their \u201cgreatest fears are weaponized against the American liberalism that has welcomed Jews for a hundred years.\u201dMoral Rot:An opinion forThe New York Post (Right bias)said Gay\u2019s resignation is \u201cjust the start\u201d and raises concerns over the integrity of Harvard\u2019s board, which \u201cthreatened The Post and possibly others who dared question her background and qualifications.\u201d The writer said the case goes beyond Harvard and \u201cillustrates the moral rot that has turned many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious campuses into leftist indoctrination factories.\u201dUpdated 1/3/24 at 7:51pm ET to specify that Stephens is rated Lean Right.",
