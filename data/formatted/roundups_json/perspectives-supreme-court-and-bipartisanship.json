    "summary": "Despite increasing political polarization in the U.S., the\u00a0Supreme Court has delivered several recent unanimous or near-majority rulings on high profile cases. June 17 saw both a unanimous ruling by the Court\u00a0on\u00a0Fulton v. Philadelphia, and a 7-2 ruling touphold the Affordable Care Act. This month, aPennsylvania cheerleader's free speech caseand aNational Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) federal antitrust casealso saw unanimous or near-unanimous rulings from the Justices. This comes assome arguethat the Supreme Court has become partisan and \"unbalanced.\" President Joe Biden, whocalled the U.S. court system \"out of whack\"during his presidential campaign,created a commissionin April to investigate adding seats to the Supreme Court.Some on social mediaexpressed their surpriseat a \"rare\" unanimous Supreme Court ruling, whilesome outletspointed out\u00a0that the percentage of all unanimous Supreme Court\u00a0ranged from 36% to 66% between\u00a02008 and 2019. Somevoices on the rightclaimed that the \"divided\" Supreme Court narrative was being pushed by Democratic lawmakers as an excuse to change the structure of the Supreme Court and gain political power.Others commended the justicesfor \"properly practicing politics\" by reaching \"broad agreement on narrow issues\" and avoiding blatant partisanship.",
