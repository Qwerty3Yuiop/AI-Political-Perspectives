    "summary": "Cambridge Dictionary recently updated its definitions of \"man\" and \"woman\" to include versions that mention transgender people.The Changes:The primary entry for \"man\" remains \"an adult male human being,\" but a new secondary entry defines the term as \"an adult who lives and identifies as male though they may have been said to have a different sex at birth.\" The added secondary entry for \"woman\" reads similarly.For Context:LGBTQ+ issues,gender dysphoria and transition procedures,\u00a0and thedefinitions of \"man\" and \"woman\"are the focus of an ongoing culture war. Dictionary.compicked \"woman\"as its word of 2022, saying the choice \"reflects how the intersection of gender, identity, and language dominates the current cultural conversation.\"\u00a0In 2020, Merriam-Webster expanded its definitions of \"male\"\u00a0and \"female\"\u00a0to include \"having a gender identity that is the opposite\" of the other.According to SimilarWeb, Cambridge Dictionary is the #9 most popular online dictionary worldwide, with over 63 million estimated visits in October.How the Media Covered It:Right-rated outlets covered the story more prominently than left- and center-rated sources did. Coverage from the left typically framed the move as rightfully more inclusive of transgender people. AWashington Post (Lean Left bias)reporthighlightedprior threats against dictionary publishers over their definitions of \"man\" and \"woman.\"\u00a0Right-rated voices often criticized the change. A\u00a0writer for thePost Millennial (Lean Right bias)called it an\"outright lie\"meant to\u00a0\"appease trans activists.\"",
