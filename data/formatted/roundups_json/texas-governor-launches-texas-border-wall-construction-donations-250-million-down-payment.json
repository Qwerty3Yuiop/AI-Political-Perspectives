This comes after President Joe Biden halted the southern border wall construction shortly after he took office; more than 450 miles of wall, including in Texas, had been built under the Trump administration.On Tuesday, former President Donald Trumpsaid he\u00a0\u201caccepted the invitation\u201d from Abbott to tour Texas' border wall on June 30.
