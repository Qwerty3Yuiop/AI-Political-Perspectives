    "summary": "The Biden administration is pushing for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d toreshape geopolitics in the Middle East,including normalizing relations between Israel andSaudi Arabia.The Details:The deal may also include a defense pact between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, as well as U.S. support for uranium enrichment in a Saudi civilian nuclear program. OnWednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. President Joe Biden that Palestinian leadership could be included in the deal but should not be given veto power in negotiations.For Context:Several Middle Eastern countries have made appeals to diplomacy and stability this week. Israel\u2019s Netanyahumetwith Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan before his White House visit. Diplomats from the U.S. and severalGulf statesarereportedlywelcoming \u201cregional de-escalation\u201d and \u201cdiplomatic engagement\u201d with Iran. And while Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said at the U.N. that peace could not prevail without recognition of Palestinian statehood, he is also reportedly willing tosoftensome demands as part of the broader deal with Saudi Arabia.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was most common in international outlets, often focusing on Netanyahu\u2019s meeting with Biden. Coverage from the right sometimes focused on criticisms of Biden, whoFox News (Right bias)said previously snubbed Netanyahu; Fox host Bret Baier also interviewedSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,who touted the \u201chistorical\u201d deal. However, an op-ed in theFinancial Times (Center bias)was skeptical, calling the effort \u201cmisguided\u201d and potentially a \u201cgrand illusion.\u201d",
