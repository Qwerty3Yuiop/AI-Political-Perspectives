    "summary": "Black Lives Matter used donations to buy a $6 million home. Does the move represent a milestone of progress for the movement, or a misuse of funds?The home is more than 7,400 square feet and has parking for more than 20 cars. It was purchased by Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation in late 2020 through a private LLC. AstoryfromNew York Magazine (Left bias)said the organization's leaders \"hoped to keep the house\u2019s existence a secret.\" A BLM organization board member said the organization bought the property\u00a0to be a \"housing and studio space for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship,\" and that the group planned to\u00a0disclose the house in legal filings this May.News sources on all sides of the spectrum highlighted transparency concerns regarding the purchase. The home purchase and scrutiny of the organization's finances has been a major story from right-rated sources over the past two years and especially in recent months. Left- and center-rated sources have covered the subject\u00a0much less. One story from NBC News highlighted some who said the purchase was a sign of success for the movement, and others who said it was an inappropriate use of funds. Stories from right-rated news sources often frame the purchase as unethical and possibly illegal, and suggest thatBlack Lives Matter's entire financial structure is unstableandcompromised by corruption. Some on the right highlighted how Facebookcensored some storieson the $6 million purchase\u00a0for being\u00a0\"abusive.\"",
