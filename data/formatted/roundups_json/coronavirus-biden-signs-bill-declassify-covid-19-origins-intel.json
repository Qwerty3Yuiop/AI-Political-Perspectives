The theory wasdismissed as a conspiracyby many journalists and Democrats early in the pandemic. Some agencies, including the Director of National Intelligence, still believe natural animal-to-human transmission was more likely. Other intelligence groups, including the CIA, are undecided. Over the weekend, a group of international researchers unveiled evidence that the pandemicoriginated from a pack of raccoon dogsin Wuhan. China rejects the lab theory, and hasobstructed investigationsinto COVID-19's origins.How the Media Covered It:Sources across the spectrum covered the signing prominently. Some right-rated sources focused more on how some media outlets prematurely discounted the lab leak theory.",
