    "headline": "Booster Shots Be Made Available All Americans Starting Sept 20",
    "summary": "The Biden administrationannounced Wednesdaythat third shots of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines will be made available to all Americans starting Sept. 20. The push for the third\u00a0shots, commonly known as booster shots, comes alongside recent statements by vaccine makers and health experts thatCOVID-19 vaccines may be less effective\u00a0after 6-8 months. Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO)called for wealthy nations to\u00a0halt\u00a0booster shotsuntil at least the end of next month so that less-vaccinated countries have more opportunities to distribute shots.The news made headlines across the political spectrum, with few major differences along partisan lines. Coverage from right-rated sources focused more on the WHO's opposition to the move and how that conflict might prompt international criticism of the U.S. vaccine strategy.",
