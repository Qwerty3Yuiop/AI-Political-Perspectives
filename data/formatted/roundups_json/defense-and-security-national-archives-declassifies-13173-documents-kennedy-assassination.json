Kennedy's 1963 assassination.The Details:The documents released Thursday included information about Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's extensive CIA \"personality file,\" which the agency said was created three years before the assassination. Newly-released files also shine light on\u00a0undercover CIA surveillance of Oswald when he visited Mexico City in September 1963, several weeks before the assassination. Those files suggest that Oswald made contact with Soviet and Cuban spies on the trip, including an assassination\u00a0specialist, and that\u00a0CIA operatives in Mexico City possibly mismanaged evidence that could have saved Kennedy\u2019s life if it was relayed to the Secret Service more quickly.For Context:The release followed anexecutive orderfrom President Joe Biden\u00a0authorizing their publication. Thousands more documents remain classified; the National Archives says more than 97% of the collection's records are now publicly accessible.\u00a0Last year, Bidenpostponedthe release, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, and gave\u00a0the National Archives one year to\u00a0review documents before they were released. That\u00a0deadline expired Thursday.How the Media Covered It:The release was a top story across the political spectrum Thursday evening. Sources on both left and right highlighted how many documents remain classified. Many reports also cited officials who said the files were unlikely to include anything suggesting that Oswald wasn't the killer or that Kennedy's killing was part of a government conspiracy.",
