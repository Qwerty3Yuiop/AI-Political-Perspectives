    "summary": "What will be the impact of Pope Francis\u2019 letter approving theblessings of same sex couplesunder certain circumstances?Deliberate Confusion:InThe National Review (Right bias),Michael Brendan Dougherty (Lean Right bias)argued that the announcement contained a \u201cdeliberate\u201d confusion regarding the Vatican\u2019s stance on same sex unions that allows room for interpretation, writing that the document \u201cmust be accepted as orthodox, but another valid response is to reject it as insufficient and wish it had gone further.\u201d Dougherty determines that the language of the text indicates same sex unions cannot be blessed, but individuals in same sex unions can be blessed individually. Overall, the language of the announcement sends the message that \u201cas long as it all remains informal, priests can do what they want here.\u201dIncremental Change:A writer inCNN Opinion (Left bias)determined that the announcement will \u201cbring hope\u201d to LGBT Catholics seeking acceptance in the church, but does not revise Catholic doctrine. News coverage framing the document as an acceptance of same sex unions from the church is an example of the Pope \u201cgetting a lot of headlines for making cautious incremental change at the margins.\u201d The writer determines that the vagueness of the document\u2019s language diminishes its impact, framing it as another example of incremental change during Pope Francis\u2019 decade at the head of the church that could \u201cevaporate on his death, leaving behind some confusion, a lot of disappointment, and very few substantive reforms.\u201d",
