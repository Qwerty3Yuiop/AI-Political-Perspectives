Officials will begin exhuming the graves on Friday to look for signs of torture and war crimes.

The recentUkrainian counteroffensivepushed Russians out of the city.A senior adviser to Zelenskyy said that \"many places of mass burials\" and\"many places where people were tortured\"had been found in other retaken cities. When Ukraineretook the city of Buchain April, hundreds of bodies of civilians were discovered in mass graves and in the streets, sparking accusations of Russian war crimes.The mass graves in Izyum were covered prominently by news sources across the spectrum, and sources on all sideshighlighted similar aspects of the story.",
