    "summary": "In the final days of his administration, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) has\u00a0stacked shipping containers on top of each other\u00a0along the southern border to curb an influx of unauthorized migrants.The Debate:Ducey\u00a0argues that\u00a0the state holds jurisdiction over the 60-foot area around the state\u2019s eastern border with Mexico, and must protect it from criminal activity.\u00a0Federal agencies have deemed the operation unlawful and told Ducey\u00a0to stop. Meanwhile, environmentalists say the container wall\u00a0could endanger species and harm water systems.Key Quotes:Ducey said that \"Arizona is going to do the job that Joe Biden refuses to do \u2014 secure the border in any way we can. We're not backing down.\"\u00a0Santa Cruz County Sheriff David Hathaway pushed back\u00a0and said that \"it's not state land, it's not private land, and the federal government has said [it's]\u00a0illegal activity,\" while threatening to arrest anyone involved with construction.For Context:The number of migrants arriving at the southern border has hitmultiple recordhighsthis year. That's\u00a0expected to continue with therecent end of Title 42, and multiple right-rated news sources reported Monday that Immigration\u00a0and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have beentold to\u00a0reduce arrestsso extra detention beds are available for an anticipated surge.How the Media Covered It:Sources across the spectrum, especially center- and right-rated sources,\u00a0covered the news and the sheriff's remarks. Notably, BBC News featured it as a top story on its homepage Monday afternoon.",
