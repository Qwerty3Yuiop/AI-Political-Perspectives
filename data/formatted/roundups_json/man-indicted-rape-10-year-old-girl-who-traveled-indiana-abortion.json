    "summary": "The man accused of raping a 10-year-old girl who traveled from Ohio to Indiana for an abortion wasindicted by a grand juryin Ohio Thursday.Authorities reportedlycharged a 27-year-old man with\u00a0two counts of rape, and the indictment said that the victim was 9 years old at the time of the rape.\u00a0The suspect, an unauthorized immigrant, faces a life sentence and deportation if convicted.The\u00a0case has become a recent focus in\u00a0debate over the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and went viral aftera\u00a0gynecologist\u00a0reported the rape and the girl's out-of-state travelto the Indianapolis Star. Before the suspect was arrested and confessed to authorities, some right-rated media outlets and prominent political leaderscast doubt on the storyand questioned the gynecologist for purportedly failing to report the abortion.The\u00a0indictment was covered across the political spectrum, as was the initial rape and fallout over the girl's travel to Indiana, which at the timesparked some examples of media bias and questionable reporting. Coverage from some right-rated outlets highlighted how the suspect is an unauthorized immigrant, and focused on how the victim's motherappeared to defend himand didn't press charges. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources instead focused more on framing Ohio's abortion ban as especially restrictive since it doesn't make exceptions for rape or incest.",
