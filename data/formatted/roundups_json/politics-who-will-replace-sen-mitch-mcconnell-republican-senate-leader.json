    "summary": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced Wednesdaythat he'll be stepping down from his positionas minority leader in November. Who will replace him?The Three Johns:An analysis inPolitico (Lean Left bias)listed three likely replacements\u2014 Sen. John Thune (R-SD), Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). The article described Thune as a \u201clow-key and affable\u201d politician who is giving \u201csoft support\u201d to Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. Cornyn\u2019s style of politics \u201cruns a bit more bare-knuckled\u201d but leaves room for the occasional bipartisan compromise. Barrasso is the \u201cmost vocally pro-Trump and conservative\u201d of the likely choices and has already \u201ctried to ingratiate himself and ease his path up the leadership ladder.\u201dWildcard Picks:An article inNewsweek (Center bias)listed Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) as other potential candidates. Daines declined to indicate if he would pursue the leadership position, telling Newsweek, \u201cthis is the time to reflect on Leader McConnell's legacy and accomplishments.\u201dFrom the Right:A writer inThe Federalist (Right bias)stated that the \u201cbid to replace America\u2019s least popular politician is off to the races.\u201d The writer urged Senate Republicans to elect a leader \u201cwho will adhere to the wishes of their voters and place American interests first,\u201d criticizing McConnell for \u201chis willingness to place foreign interests above American ones.\u201d Of the likely replacements, the writer urged against Thune and Cornyn due to their support for a recent foreign aid bill.",
