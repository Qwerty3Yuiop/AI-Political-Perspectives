    "summary": "The Biden\u00a0administration announced Monday that international travelers will be required to have proof of COVID-19 vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test to enter the country starting in early November. Nonessential air travel to the U.S. had been banned from several major European countries, Iran and China for most of the pandemic. White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Monday the\u00a0rules will \"protect Americans here at home, and enhance the safety of the international air travel system.\" Unvaccinated U.S. citizens will need to be tested for COVID-19\u00a0within a day before returning to the U.S. and again\u00a0after they arrive home. The new rules do not affect land travel from Mexico or Canada, where bans on nonessential travel are still in effect.The news made headlines across the spectrum Monday. Some coverage from right-rated sources placed more emphasis on the vaccine requirement; some coverage from left-rated outlets focused on the relaxed restrictions for vaccinated people.",
