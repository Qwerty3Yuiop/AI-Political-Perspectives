    "summary": "The progressive Jewish action website Bend the Arc has published a petition backed by 11 Jewish leaders and 35,000 signatures telling President Trump not to visit Pittsburgh unless he denounces white nationalism. Supporters of the move have largely blamed Trump's rhetoric for the shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue, while some opponents have criticized the media's coverage of the story as left-leaning.",
