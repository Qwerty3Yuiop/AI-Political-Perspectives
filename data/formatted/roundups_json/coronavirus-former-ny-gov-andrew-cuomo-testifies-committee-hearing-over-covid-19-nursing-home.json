    "summary": "Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY)was questionedby the Republican-led House\u00a0coronavirus subcommittee Tuesday\u00a0on his\u00a0March 25, 2020 directive regarding nursing homes in the state.The Directive:The directivetold nursing homes, \u201c[n]o resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19\u201d and \u201c[nursing homes] are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested from COVID-19 prior to admission or re-admission.\u201dFor Context:More than 15,000 died of COVID-19 in New York nursing homes,according to state data. The March 25 directive was amended on May 10, 2020, prohibiting hospitals from discharging patients to nursing homes unless they tested negative for COVID-19.The Hearing:The subcommittee questioned Cuomo about whether his March 25 directive was in line with federal health guidance and whether he revised nursing home deaths down. Cuomo said that his directive was in line with federal health guidance, and that staff, rather than nursing home patients, were the cause of COVID-19 outbreaks.How the Media Covered It:National Review News (Lean Right bias)highlightedan exchange during the hearing where Cuomo said he did not meet with public health authorities before signing the directive. Cuomo did say that the New York State Health Department was putting out new guidance constantly and that they did not reach out to him. In contrast,CNN (Lean Left)emphasizedthat Cuomo expressed sympathy for the victims of COVID-19 and criticized President Donald Trump's COVID-19 response.",
