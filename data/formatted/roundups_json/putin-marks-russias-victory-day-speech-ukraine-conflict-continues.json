    "headline": "Putin Marks Russias Victory Day Speech Ukraine Conflict Continues",
    "summary": "On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave his Victory Day speech at the Kremlin and condemned the United States and other countries for supporting\u00a0a \"threat\" on Russia's borders.Putin also tied the current government of Ukraine to the Nazis, perhaps citing the Azov\u00a0Battalion, which is a unit of Ukraine's National Guard that has ahistory of anti-semitic controversies. Russia's Victory Day has become a day to remember the sacrifices of World War II, when twenty-seven\u00a0million Soviet citizens died, and to be a show of military strength. Putin's\u00a0messaging on\u00a0Victory Day aimed to encourage Russian nationalism to justify thewar on Ukraine, particularly asRussians suffer from economic sanctions and international isolationism.News sources across the spectrum highlighted the speech and Putin's criticisms of U.S. leaders.",
