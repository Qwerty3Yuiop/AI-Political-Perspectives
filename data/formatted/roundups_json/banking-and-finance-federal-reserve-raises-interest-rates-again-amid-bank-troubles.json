    "summary": "The Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates by another quarter-point on Wednesday, continuing its fight against inflation as banks dealt with thefallout from Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s collapse.Key Quotes:In astatementexplaining the decision, the Fed\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) pointed to\u201cmodest\u201d economic growth,\u201crobust\u201d jobs gains, andlow unemployment. Regarding recent turmoil in the banking industry, the committee said, \u201cThe U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\u201dFor Context:Silicon Valley Bank iswidely consideredto have collapsed in part because of its over-reliance on bonds, which lost value when the Fed began raising interest rates to fight inflation. That, andbroader fears of financial fallout in the banking system,led some to question the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies. On Wednesday, Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced a bill to increase oversight of the Fed\u2019s decisions.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was common across the spectrum, matching trends from previous rate hikes. Some coverage used words like \u201cdespite\u201d to potentially frame the Fed\u2019s decision as counterintuitive in the face of a\u00a0\u201cbanking crisis.\u201d",
