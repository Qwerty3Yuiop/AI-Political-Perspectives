    "summary": "The\u00a0new security partnership\u00a0between the US,\u00a0UK and Australia \u2014 titled \"AUKUS\" \u2014 has sparked backlash from various world leaders who feel compromised by the alliance.Announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, the alliance between the\u00a0three English-speaking nations is meant tostrengthen their security intereststhrough cooperation on defense technology. AUKUS' first major initiative will be to supply Australia with a new\u00a0nuclear-powered submarine fleet, resulting in the\u00a0cancellation of Australia's $90 billion deal with France to build submarines. Describing\u00a0the partnership\u00a0as \u201ctreason in the making,\u201d French ambassador Jean-Pierre Thebault said on Saturday that Australia has made a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that showcased\u00a0\u201cunacceptable behavior between allies and partners.\u201d The French Embassy also canceled\u00a0an event\u00a0that would have recognized the 240th anniversary of a Revolutionary War battle, an event that\u00a0symbolized strong cooperation\u00a0between the U.S.\u00a0and France.\u00a0While Australia is not looking to develop its own nuclear weapons, New Zealand was absent from the deal due to its\u00a0nuclear-free policy; Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stated Thursday that Australia's nuclear submarines will be banned from New Zealand waters.Most stories across the spectrum noted how the AUKUS partnership has\u00a0\"aggravated already tense relations\" with China.\u00a0Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called on the alliance\u00a0to abandon their \"outdated Cold War zero-sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical stability,\" indicating that\u00a0their deal has\u00a0\"intensified the arms race.\"",
