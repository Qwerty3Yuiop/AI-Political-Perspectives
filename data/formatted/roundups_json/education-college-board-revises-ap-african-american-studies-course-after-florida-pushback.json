    "summary": "The College Board released a revised version of its\u00a0Advanced Placement African American studies course on Wednesday,\u00a0following Florida Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis's (R) decision toblock the programfrom being taught in\u00a0the state\u2019s schools.The Details:Several writers and scholars associated withcritical race theory (CRT), the black queer experience, and black feminism\u00a0were removed from the curriculum.\u00a0Required teachings on Black Lives Matter and reparations were also removed. Both subjects remain on a list of options for a required research project, along with the newly-added \"black conservatism.\"Key Quotes:\"At the College Board, we can\u2019t look to statements of political leaders,\" said CEO David Coleman. He attributed the changes to \"the input of professors\" and \"longstanding A.P. principles.\"For Context:DeSantis took issue with the inclusion of curriculum covering queer theory, intersectionality, and abolishing prisons, and accused it of harboring a political agenda. \"We want education, not indoctrination,\"\u00a0he said at the time.How the Media Covered It:Right-rated sources typically framed the revised curriculum as a win for \"anti-woke\" education. One writer for National ReviewpraisedDeSantis, saying it \"took courage to face a torrent of false racism charges and get this win.\" Some left-rated sources highlighted criticism of DeSantis and the College Board.\u00a0Several\u00a0left-rated opinion writers, including fromWashington PostandNew York Times (Lean Left bias), said DeSantis\"attacked\"black history and attempted to\"erase\"it from high school curriculum.",
