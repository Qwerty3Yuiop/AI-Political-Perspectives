    "summary": "When the Supreme Court opens its term on October 3rd, it will convene with thelowest public approval ratingin modern\u00a0history.\u00a0A recentGallup Pollfound that only 47% of adults surveyed trust the court, which is six percentage points lower than the 53% reported in 2015. 58% of respondents told Gallup they disapprove of the Supreme Court's job performance, which is a record high. This matters, since the Supreme Court relies onpublic respect for its legitimacyas\u00a0the justices have no independent enforcement power for their decisions.\u00a0The poll comes after recentlandmark\u00a0decisionson issues such a gun rights and abortion \u2014 most notably, theoverturning of Roe v. Wade.Meanwhile,Justice Samuel Alitohas defended recent rulings, saying that those who question the legitimacy of the Supreme Court have\u00a0\u201ccrossed an important line.\u201d His comment was a response toJustice Elena Kagan's remarksimplying that the conservative majority on the court was acting on behalf of the Republican Party.Sources from across the political spectrum have covered this poll, with some on the left focusing on the fact thatSenate Republicans hurt public supportfor the court by not considering the nomination of Merrick Garland by then-President Barack Obama, but then later considering the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett under then-President Donald Trump. A number of sources pointed out\u00a0thatpublic trust in democratic institutionsand processes in general has dropped.",
