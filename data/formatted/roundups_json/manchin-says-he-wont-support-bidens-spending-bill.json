    "summary": "On Sunday, Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) came out in opposition to President Joe Biden's Build Back\u00a0Better spending bill, delivering a\u00a0blow to the president's agenda after over five months of\u00a0negotiating with Democrats.\u00a0 Manchin claims the bill would worsen budget deficits and fuel inflation. Biden and other Democrats say that its education, job training, and other initiatives would curb inflation and spur economic growth in the long-term.Congress has recessed for the Christmas holidays, and it is unlikely that the Senate will be recalled to force an immediate vote.\u00a0 When the bill is re-addressed in January, it is likely that Biden's plans to address wealth inequality and climate change\u00a0will\u00a0be reworked, and the focus could narrow to priorities such as the expanded child tax credit.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) promises to keep scheduling votes until some version of the Build Back Better bill is passed.",
