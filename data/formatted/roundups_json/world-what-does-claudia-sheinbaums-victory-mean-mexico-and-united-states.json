    "summary": "How willMexican president-elect Claudia Sheinbaumchange the country and impact the United States?From the Left:The Washington Post Editorial Board (Lean Left bias)determined the election \u201c\u200braises a legitimate concern about Mexico\u2019s future: The party that won big on Sunday looks set to use its vast power to dismantle the institutions underpinning Mexican democracy, rebuilding the single-party rule that existed in the seven decades before the country\u2019s democratic turn 24 years ago.\u201d The board questions if Sheinbaum, who comes from the same party as Mexico\u2019s current president, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, will continue in his efforts to \u201chamstring the institutions built to constrain presidential power\u201d or if she will continue the fight for multi-party representation in Mexico.From the Right:A writer in theWashington Examiner (Lean Right bias)characterized Sheinbaum as a \u201cleftist who blames capitalism for the millions of Mexicans who live in poverty\u201d who has \u201cpromised an expansion of the welfare state.\u201d Given the current president\u2019s effort to dismantle the autonomous election agency, the writer predicted Mexico will soon become \u201ca single-party authoritarian dictatorship. Leftists will control a country that shares a 1,950-mile border with the United States.\u201d This led the writer to conclude, \u201cThe U.S. has been quiescent for too long regarding Mexico. It is time to play hardball with the leaders in Mexico City. If Mexico wants free trade with the U.S., a condition must be its shunning of China and stepping up the efforts against the cartels.\u201d",
