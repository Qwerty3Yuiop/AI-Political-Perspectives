    "headline": "Perspectives Should Gen Milley Be Fired Over Calls Top Chinese General",
    "summary": "Gen. Mark\u00a0Milley, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, is facing criticism overphone calls he had with China's top general last year. According to a forthcoming book, Milley acted to limit former President Donald Trump's powers\u00a0and\u00a0told the Chinese general that he'd warn him of any forthcoming U.S. attack.\u00a0After the book's contents became public, Trump accused Milley of treason. President Joe Biden said he has \"great confidence\" in Milley Wednesday.\u00a0A spokesperson for Milleytweeted Thursdaydefended the calls, saying they\u00a0were done to \"maintain strategic stability.\"\u00a0Contrary to initial reports, sources across the spectrum saythe calls were not secretand that 13 other people were present, including a State Department\u00a0official.Voices on the right have been highly critical of Milley. Many argue that\u00a0if the book is accurate, Milley stepped outside the chain of command and unjustly undermined the president. Some\u00a0called for him to resign or be fired, including several Republican lawmakers andretired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified against Trump in his\u00a0first impeachment trial. Ananalysis from CNN (Left bias)suggested the book's claims\u00a0raised more concerns about Trump's mental fitness.A report from Politico (Lean Left bias)suggested the authors\u00a0exaggerated the calls and that Trump Defense Sec. Chris Miller approved them. Millerdenied that narrative in a recent Fox News (Right bias)interview.",
