    "summary": "President Joe Biden publicly refused to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, or to commutehis currently-undecided sentence for federal gun crimes.Key Quotes:\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of my son, Hunter. He\u2019s one of the greatest, most decent men I know, and I am satisfied that I\u2019m not going to do anything I said,\u201d the President stated. \u201cI said I\u2019d abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.\u201d Asked if a commutation was on the table, Biden said, \u201cNo.\u201dFor Context:Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in jail, but he could also merely receive probation. He faces a second federal trial in September for allegations of failing to pay $1.4 million in federal taxes on overseas income between 2016 and 2019.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was common across the spectrum, with some\u00a0outlets reflecting partisan attitudes about the Bidens.The Daily Wire (Right bias)highlighted a Trump advisor who said Hunter\u2019s \u201cdad made him \u2018thebag man,\u2019\u201d implying both were corrupt. TheNew York Post (Lean Right bias),which has for years published partially nude photos of Hunter taken from his laptop, highlighted that Joe Biden called him \u201cone of the brightest,most decentmen,\u201d potentially poking fun at the contrast between the quote and reality. Like the Post, some coverage from left-rated outlets prominently noted that the elder Biden said he was \u201cproud\u201d of his son.This summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.",
