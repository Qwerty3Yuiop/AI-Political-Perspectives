The plan is called \u201cAll In: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness\u201d and was developed by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness with the help of 19 federal agencies.Key Quotes:Astatement from the White Housecalled the plan \u201cthe most ambitious effort by any administration to prevent people from becoming homeless, address inequities that disproportionately impact underserved communities, including people of color and other marginalized groups, and help cities and states reduce unsheltered homelessness.\u201dFrom the Right:An analysis in the National Review quoted a number of housing advocates who questioned the plan, stating the proposed strategy is overly vague and does not address the root causes of homelessness. Noting the historic shortcomings of federal-programs to address homelessness, the article determines the \u2018All In\u2019 plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t really read like a plan at all, but more like a plan to develop plans.\u201dFrom the Left:An analysis from The Week laid out the multiple approaches included in the \u2018All In\u2019 plan, breaking down the central tenet of the proposal\u2013 the \u201cHousing First\u201d model\u2013 where homeless individuals are given housing first with no preconditions before addressing issues such as drug addiction or mental health.
