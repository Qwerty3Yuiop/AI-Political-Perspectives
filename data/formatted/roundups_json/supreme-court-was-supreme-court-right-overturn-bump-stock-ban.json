    "headline": "Supreme Court Was Supreme Court Right Overturn Bump Stock Ban",
    "summary": "On Friday, the Supreme Courtoverruled a federal ban on bump stocks. The ruling renewed debate across the political spectrum over the controversial firearm modification.From the Left:A writer inSalon (Left bias)stated, \u201cOne might hope a ruling that stands to inflict so much carnage would, at least, be indisputably compelled by law. It is not,\u201d arguing that the ruling \u201ctortures statutory text beyond all recognition, defying Congress\u2019 clear and (until now) well-established commands.\u201d The writer argued the court misrepresented and unfairly dismissed investigations conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives on bump stocks that deemed semi-automatic weapons equipped with bump stocks to be classified as machine guns, which strengthened the legal case for a ban.From the Right:Charles C. W. Cooke (Right bias)argued the case \u201cwas not whether bump stocks count as \u2018arms,\u2019 but whether the National Firearms Act of 1934 grants the executive branch the power to regulate them in the same manner as it regulates machine guns. As the Court makes clear, the answer to this is unquestionably no. In consequence, the regulation must fall.\u201d Cooke determined the ban only happened as a result of the 2018 Las Vegas shooting, stating, \u201cThat pressure was real. But it was not law.\u201d Cooke concluded, \u201cIf one wishes, one can argue that Congressoughtto have changed the law after the Nevada massacre. But it didn\u2019t. And, because it didn\u2019t, the executive branch\u201d did not have the power to do so.",
