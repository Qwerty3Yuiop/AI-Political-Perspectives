    "headline": "Perspectives Bidens Afghan Evacuation Strategy",
    "summary": "As evacuations continued this week for Americans and vulnerable Afghans out of Kabul, the conversation about Afghanistan shifted from the troop withdrawal itself to the Biden administration\u2019s strategy for evacuation and withdrawal.Thursday\u2019s suicide bombings, which killed at least 13 American soldiers and dozens of Afghans, added greater intensity to the debate. President Joe Biden once againdefended the withdrawalon Thursday, telling reporters that he would not be deterred by terrorist attacks. Biden reaffirmed his commitment to evacuating all Americans who sought evacuation byAug. 31and said that evacuation efforts would continue for remaining Americans and vulnerable Afghans even after American\u00a0troops left the country.Voices in left-rated outlets were mixed, including writers whocriticized the withdrawal, called for others not topoliticize Afghans\u2019 suffering, said the chaotic withdrawal wasinevitable, and pointed to America\u2019s20-year military presenceitself as the issue. Voices in right-rated outlets were broadly critical of the evacuation strategy and of President Joe Biden specifically, including writers who said Biden wasincompetent, criticized the military\u2019s coordination with the Taliban to provide security, called out a purported \u201ckill list\u201d of names given to the Taliban to facilitate airport access, and accused Biden ofabandoning Americans.",
