    "summary": "Thousands of mourners gathered for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny\u2019s funeral in Moscow on Friday, despite Kremlin warnings against spontaneous memorials.The Details:The crowd reportedly stretched for at least half a mile outside the church where the funeral service took place. The funeral was marked by an intense police presence due to fears of unauthorized protests from Navalny's supporters, who blame Russia's government for his death. As Navalny's coffin arrived at the church, the crowd started chanting his name; some reportedly shouted, \u201cPutin is a killer,\u201d \u201cfree political prisoners,\u201d and \u201cno to war.\u201d Due to restrictions, cameras were not allowed inside the church during the service, but some pictures on social media showed the public laying red and white roses on Navalny's open casket.For Context:Alexei Navalnyhad been the face of the Russian opposition movement for over a decade.He died inside an Arctic Circle prison, where he was serving a 19-year sentence for what many believe were fabricated offenses. He also previously survived being poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent in 2020. The Kremlin denied involvement in Navalny\u2019s death and prior poisoning.How The Media Covered It:Coverage across the spectrum generally covered Navalny favorably, framing the gathering as an act of defiance of Putin. Articles often played up Navalny\u2019s role in Russia, withCNN (Lean Left bias)calling him \u201cPutin\u2019s most formidable opponent\u201d andFox News (Right bias)calling him a \u201cPutin arch-nemesis.\u201dThis summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.",
