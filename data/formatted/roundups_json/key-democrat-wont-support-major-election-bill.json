    "headline": "Key Democrat Wont Support Major Election Bill",
    "summary": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.)published an op-ed Sunday in the Charleston Gazette-Mailexplaining why he won't vote for theFor the People Act, a Democratic-backed bill aimed at revamping voting access in\u00a0U.S. elections. Manchin criticized the bill as partisan and said it \"will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy.\" After passing the House along party lines, Senate Republicansblocked the bill's passage with a filibuster last month. Manchin's opposition to the bill likely means it will fail to pass in Congress.Coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted Manchin's criticisms of the legislation, especially his opinion that the law would fuel division and polarization around elections. Reports from left-rated sources often speculated about\u00a0what the news means for the future of voting rights legislation; some also focused on how Manchin's resistance to this and other bills is at odds with key parts of President Joe Biden's agenda.",
