    "summary": "Dr. Vinay Prasad, Chief Officer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was reinstated as director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research on Saturday, afterhe resigned in late July amid political controversies.The Details:Prasad was reinstated following FDA Commissioner Marty Makary\u2019s request, which reportedly prompted the White House to review the situation. MAGA activist Laura Loomer advocated for Prasad\u2019s removal, accusing him of working against the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. Shecalled the reinstation, \u201cjust more evidence of a broken vetting system with no standards.\u201dFor Context:Prasadresigned after less than three monthsof federal employment, likely due to disputes with both Loomer and biopharmaceutical company Sarepta Therapeutics.Key Quote:Health and Human Services (HHS) spokesperson Andrew Nixon said on Saturday, \u201cAt the FDA\u2019s request, Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Neither the White House nor HHS will allow the fake news media to distract from the critical work the FDA is carrying out under the Trump administration.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:News media on the left covered Prasad\u2019s departure and reinstation more broadly than media in the center and on the right, but outlets across the political spectrum noted that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Makary opposed his resignation.Newsweek (Center bias)took a sensational approach, focusing on Loomer\u2019s opposition and response. BothPolitico (Lean Left)andWashington Examiner (Lean Right)highlighted the disputes among conservative officials.Written by the AllSides staff (of humans).Learn more.Support our mission.Suggest an improvement to this summary.",
