    "summary": "GOP criticisms of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson\u00a0drove top headlines across the spectrum on Tuesday.On Tuesday, Jackson responded to concerns by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) over her purportedly lighter sentencing in child pornography cases, saying she followed statutory guidelines for sentences to be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), referencing Democratic skepticism of then-nomineeAmy Coney Barrett\u2019s religious views, asked Jackson, \u201cWhat faith are you, by the way?\u201d and \u201cCould you fairly judge a Catholic?\u201d Furthermore, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) asked Jackson, \u201cIs it your personal hidden agenda to incorporate critical race theory into our legal system?\u201dCoverage of the hearings was starkly split between left and right-rated outlets. InFox News (Right), Jackson \u201cdodged\u201d questions, \u201cfumbled\u201d answers, and was tied to a school that purportedly taught critical race theory. InCNN (Left), Jackson \u201crejected\u201d Republicans\u2019 \u201cbizarre\u201d criticisms and past \u201cgrievances.\u201d Overall, right-rated outlets focused on criticisms of Jackson, while left-rated outlets praised her record and critiqued the right\u2019s criticisms. On the issue of child pornography sentencing, while aWashington Examiner (Lean Right)writer argued Hawley had \u201cevery right\u201d to raise concerns, articles in bothABC News (Lean Left)andNational Review (Right)said Jackson\u2019s sentencing record was \u201cmainstream\u201d and \u201cstandard fare.\u201d",
