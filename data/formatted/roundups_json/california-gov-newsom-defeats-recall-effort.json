    "summary": "A majority of Californians voted againstthe effort to recall\u00a0Gov. Gavin Newsom (D),\u00a0ending the lengthy campaign to oust him over what critics argued were overly restrictive COVID-19 guidelines. According to an Associated Press projection and other news sources across the spectrum, 64% of people had voted \"no\" to recalling Newsom\u00a0with roughly 68% of ballots counted as of Wednesday morning. Conservative talk show host Larry Elder was the favorite to replace Newsom if a majority of people had voted \"yes.\" Newsomtweeted, \"Now, let\u2019s get back to work\" late Tuesday; Elder conceded Tuesday night, telling\u00a0his supporters to \"be gracious in defeat.\"Coverage from left-rated outlets often framed Newsom's victory as a win for Democrats, a rebuke of traditional conservatism, and a vote for more restrictive pandemic guidelines. Coverage from right-rated sources more often reflected on the original reasons for the recall, and placed more focus on Elder's campaign and political future.",
