    "summary": "The results are in for the2022 primariesin West Virginia and Nebraska.In West Virginia, Rep. Alex Mooney, who was endorsed\u00a0by former President Donald Trump, defeated Rep. David McKinley in a primary where two incumbents faced each other due to redistricting. In Nebraska, two Trump-backed incumbents won their primaries \u2014 Reps. Adrian Smith and Carol Miller. Jim Pillen won the Republican gubernatorial nomination against Trump-backed rival Charles Herbster, who has been accused of groping at least eight women in recent years.The primary results also seemed to indicate that infrastructure was no electoral savior, as McKinley, who was running on support of last year's bipartisan infrastructure bill, lost to an opponent of the bill. Media from the\u00a0right, left and center also pointed to Herbster's loss as the first 2022 defeat of a Trump-backed candidate, after the former president sawall of his endorsements win in Ohio\u00a0last week.",
