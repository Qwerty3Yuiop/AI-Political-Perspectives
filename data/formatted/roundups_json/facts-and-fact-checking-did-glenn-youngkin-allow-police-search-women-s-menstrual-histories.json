    "summary": "Virginia Gov.\u00a0Glenn Youngkin (R) has come under fire for opposing\u00a0state legislation regarding information on women's menstrual cycles.The Details:Abillpassed by the Virginia state Senate would have prohibited search warrants for obtaining women\u2019s menstrual data on electronic devices. The bill was tabled after opposition from Youngkin\u2019s deputy secretary of public safety, Maggie Cleary. The action has sparked criticism from The Guardian,Washington Post (Lean Left Bias),the Biden Administration, andCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).Misleading Claims?The Guardian suggested Youngkin is clearing an \u201cextreme\u201d path for police to be able to search for women\u2019s menstrual histories, something that is already legal in all 50 states. Newsom said Youngkin is \u201cfighting for access to your menstrual cycle information.\u201dFor Context:Although Youngkin has proposed banning abortions after 15 weeks in Virginia, state law currently only allows law enforcement to prosecute doctors, not abortion recipients.Key Quotes:Cleary said the bill \u201cwould be the very first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of, in Virginia or anywhere, that would set a limit on what search warrants can do.\u201d\u00a0A spokesperson for Youngkin\u00a0told The Washington Post, \"The governor will not support any measures that seek to prosecute women\" for abortions.How The Media Covered It:The Guardian\u2019s original article remains intact, andtweetspromoting it remain up. However, Mediaite and Washington Free Beacon both framed The Guardian\u2019s accusations against Youngkin as false, and noted that the outlet stealth-edited its original headline.",
