    "headline": "Why Are Democrats Boosting Pro Trump Candidates 2022 Primaries",
    "summary": "Candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump have done well so far in the 2022 midterm elections, with some help from Democrats.What's behind this\u00a0confusing cross-party promotion?The answer is relatively simple:Democrats believe their party's candidates have a better chance in the general elections against pro-Trump candidates than moderate Republicans.In races across the country, Democratic party groups havecrafted campaign ads that elevate messaging from candidates aligned with Trump, such as Kari Lake, the GOP gubernatorial nominee\u00a0in Arizona, and John Gibbs, a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives from Michigan. Both Lake and Gibbs defeated more moderate Republicans in their primaries. Gibbs beat out Rep. Peter Meijer, one of the 10 House Republicans who supported Trump's impeachment.Editorial boards across the political spectrum,from the liberalNew York Times editors (Left bias)to those at the conservative National Review,criticizedDemocrats' attempts to meddle in 2022 Republican primaries \"cynical\" and hypocritical for boosting candidates that purportedly represent a threat to democracy, whichmany Democrats have saidthat Trump is. TheWashington Post's (Lean Left bias)Paul Waldman took a different side, saying that \"Democrats made a strategic judgment that struck a reasonable balance between risk and reward\" and that the meddling \"certainly won\u2019t make the Republican Party any more of a threat to our system than it already is.\"",
