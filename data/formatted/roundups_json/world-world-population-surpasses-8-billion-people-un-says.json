    "summary": "Earth\u2019s human population reached 8 billion on November 15, according to aUN report.What does this mean for the future of our species?By the Numbers:There were about 2.5 billion people alive in 1950, according toUN data\u2014 more than at any prior time in history. The population doubled to 5 billion by 1987, reaching 6 billion in 1999 and 7 billion in 2011. The UN projects that we will reach 9 billion people by 2037.For Context:Global population growth is not evenly distributed. While developed countries\u2019 fertility rates are often too low to replace current populations, rates in developing countries are still high; some countries see oversixbirths per woman of childbearing age. This trend helped create a swell ofyoung migrant workersseeking new lives in developed countrieslike the U.S.According to the UN,90%of future growth will come from low-income and lower-middle-income countries.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was widespread across the spectrum, but analyses of potential environmental \u201cchallenges\u201d were more common in left-rated outlets. AWashington Post (Lean Left bias)analysis stood out by noting that \u201ctwo-thirds of mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians have beenlostin the past approximately 50 years.\u201d Meanwhile, aDaily Wire (Right bias)article dismissed the concerns of \u201cclimate activists,\u201d arguing that population growth produced \u201crobust innovation and productive capacity\u201d benefits.",
