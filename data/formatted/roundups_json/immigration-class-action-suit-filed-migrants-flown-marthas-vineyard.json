The suit, filed in Massachusetts federal court, is asking a judgeto declare the relocations illegalunder the Constitution as well as state and federal laws. Earlier this week,\u00a0Lawyers for Civil Rights had asked\u00a0state\u00a0and\u00a0federal\u00a0authorities to investigate the flights, and aTexas sheriff has also opened an investigation.DeSantis's administration responded\u00a0by saying that the migrantsmade the journey voluntarilyafter signing consent forms, and that they were well cared for.
