    "summary": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)signed a law Mondayaimed at regulating how social media companies moderate speech on their platforms. The law will\u00a0fine social media platforms if they\u00a0permanently ban political candidates\u00a0in Florida; allow people to sue those companies if they feel they've been unfairly deplatformed; and prevent\u00a0companies from removing content from news outlets above a certain size. DeSantis said the law will ensure Floridians \"are guaranteed protection against the Silicon Valley elites.\" Some First Amendment experts say the law is likely to be challenged on the premise that it would compel speech from private\u00a0companies, in violation of their First Amendment rights.Coverage was present across the political spectrum, but more prominent from right-rated outlets. Reports from left- and center-rated sources highlighted the law's objectives, as well as concerns about its constitutionality. Coverage from right-rated sources tended to concentrate more on the legislation's language and support for it.",
