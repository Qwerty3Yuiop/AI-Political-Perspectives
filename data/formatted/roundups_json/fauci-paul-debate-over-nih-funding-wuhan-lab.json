    "summary": "During a Senate Health Committee hearing\u00a0on Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) debated Dr. Anthony Fauci on the\u00a0National Institutes of Health's (NIH) funding of\u00a0research at a lab in Wuhan, China. In May, Paul\u00a0claimed that\u00a0the NIH fundedgain-of-function researchat the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV); then, Fauci responded that the NIH\u00a0\u201chas not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\u201d On Tuesday, Paul repeated his claims,pointing to\u00a0an academic research paper by WIV\u00a0published in 2017that cited the NIH as a resource, and implying that Fauci lied to Congress in May.\u00a0Fauci responded Tuesday that the\u00a0paper was evaluated and judged by staff as \"not being gain-of-function,\"\u00a0saying \u201cI totally resent the lie you are now propagating.\"The story was covered by outlets across the political spectrum, who focused on the claims by both Paul and Fauci. Right-rated outlets tended to frame Paul as being in the right; left-rated outlets often did the same for Dr. Fauci.",
