    "headline": "Sen Cory Booker Releases Confidential Kavanaugh Documents",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker on Thursday released a series of documents he claimed were confidential relating to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying \u201cthis is the closest I\u2019ll get to an \u2018I am Spartacus\u2019 moment.\u201d The move evoked wide criticism from Senate Republicans, prompting them to point out that the emails in question had already been approved for release. Booker then introduced additional documents on Thursday night that were still marked \"committee confidential\", violating Senate rules. Many on the Right have said that Booker is merely grandstanding for a potential presidential run, while some on the Left have argued that he is effectively standing up to Trump.",
