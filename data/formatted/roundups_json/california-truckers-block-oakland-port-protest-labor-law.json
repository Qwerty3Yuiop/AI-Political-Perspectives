    "headline": "California Truckers Block Oakland Port Protest Labor Law",
    "summary": "California truckers have been blocking access to the Port of Oakland since Monday toprotest a new state labor law.The legislation,Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), was passed in 2019 and requires companies to classify more workers as employees instead of independent contractors. While part-and full-time employees have access to a wide range of benefits from minimum wage to health insurance, over half of California\u2019s truckers are contractors that work with shipping companies as independent contractors. Many truckers believe thatthe law will diminish their\u00a0flexibility to act independently.\u00a0If the law is enforced, truckers would be required to pay up to $20,000 out-of-pocket for permits and insurance to handle their own logistics and remain independent. The protests\u00a0have\u00a0caused containers to back up at the Port of Oakland,a majort export of agricultural\u00a0exportsthat\u00a0is known asone of the 10busiest container ports in the U.S. These disruptions have\u00a0exacerbated\u00a0the ongoing\u00a0container congestion\u00a0that has occured at various California ports for months. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has dismissed truckers'\u00a0concerns and said that they \"should focus on supporting this transition\"\u00a0to the new employment law.Most reports highlighting the Oakland trucker protest were published by center-and right-rated sources.Left-rated outletswere more likely to highlight how the law allows companies the option to \"simply take the drivers on\" as employees and continue to offer them flexible schedules.Right-rated coverageemphasized how Newsom's bill forces\u00a0independent owner-operators to make an \"impossible choice\" \u2014 be\u00a0\"beholden to company regulations\" or \"quit being a truck driver.\"",
