    "summary": "Following thedeath of Tyre Nichols, who died three days after being beaten by five former members of the Memphis Police Departmentwho now face murder charges, many are reflecting onpolice brutalityand the relevance of race in Nichols' death.Policing Is The Problem, Not Racism:Both Nichols and the officers involved are black, leading some to question or critique race being discussed in response to the tragedy, instead placing the focus of the incident on flaws in policing. Theresa Dear, a NAACP board member and writer for Deseret News, determined the death of Nichols to not be about race, but instead about \u201cthe use of force and brutality by five police officers.\u201dPiers Morgan (Lean Left Bias)wrote that \u201chigh-profile black peoplehave raced to blame white people for what happened in a way that is as ridiculous as it is disingenuous.\u201dRacism Is A Problem In Policing:Others are arguing that the race of those involved is a crucial factor to consider in preventing this tragedy from repeating. CNN host Van Jones wrote that \u201csociety\u2019s message that Black people are inferior, unworthy and dangerous is pervasive,\u201d and that black people are \u201cnot immune to its pernicious effects.\u201d A writer in the Wall Street Journal Opinion determined that in order to address \u201cstereotypes of particular demographics\u201d that persist in America, it is necessary to \u201cponder how the race of suspects affects how they are treated by police.\u201d",
