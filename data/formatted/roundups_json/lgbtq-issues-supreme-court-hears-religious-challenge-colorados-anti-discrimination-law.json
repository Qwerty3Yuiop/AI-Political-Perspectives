Or about people who don\u2019t believe that disabled people should get married? Where\u2019s the line?\" Conservative Justice Samuel Alito then asked whether it\u2019s \"fair to equate opposition to same-sex marriage to opposition to interracial marriage?\" He also asked\u00a0if businesses can be\u00a0\"forced to write vows or speeches that espouse things they loath?\"How the Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum said the court's conservative majority seemed likely to side with the business owner, who a headline from LGBTQ Nation\u00a0described\u00a0as \"anti-LGBTQ.\" Left-rated outlets tended to focus more on arguments in favor of the law. Right-rated outlets more often highlighted the business owner's faith and concerns about encroachments on religious freedom.",
