    "summary": "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced Friday that\u00a0101,789 \"obsolete and outdated\" names would be deleted from the state's voter registration rolls as part of maintenance to keep the rolls updated.\u00a0Individuals do have a chance\u00a0to save their registrations before they\u2019re removed; officials will mail\u00a0notices warning of the potential cancellations, and registrations will be restored if individuals respond within 40 days. The names to be canceled make up 1.3% of Georgia's registered voters. Maintenance to keep state voter lists up-to-date is typical,\u00a0butprocedures often differ from state to state.Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets often framed the news in the context of ongoing Republican-sponsored election security legislation; some on the left see those bills\u00a0as efforts to suppress voters. Conversely, reports from right-rated sources framed Georgia's move as more routine and less controversial.",
