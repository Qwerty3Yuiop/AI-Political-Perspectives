    "summary": "Will President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin hold a summit on the Russia-Ukraine crisis? Government officials in Moscow, Washington, D.C. and elsewhere have different answers.The White House said Sunday evening that\u00a0President Biden agreed \"in principle\" to hold a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but only if Russia does not invade Ukraine. France also said Putin \"accepted the principle of such a summit\" following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. A Kremlin spokesperson gave a different impression on Monday,\u00a0saying it was \"premature to talk about any specific plans for organizing any kind of summits.\" Biden said last week that he was\"convinced [Putin's] made the decision\" to invade.Voices across the spectrum framed the summit as risky for Biden amid concerns about war,low approval ratingsand pessimism about Democrats' chances in the2022 midterm elections. A writer for CNN argued that success was unlikely if the summit isn't\u00a0\"comprehensively choreographed for success beforehand.\" Right-rated outlets often\u00a0framed the Russian spokesman's comments as \"shooting down\" the White House's plans.",
