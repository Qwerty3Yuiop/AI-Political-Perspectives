Bob Menendez (D-NJ).For Context:In September,federal prosecutors charged Menendezwith accepting bribes to benefit three New Jersey businessmen and the Egyptian government. Menendez dismissedbipartisan calls for him to resignand pleaded not guilty.Details:According to theAssociated Press (Lean Left bias), while no new charges were announced, federal prosecutors allege in the new indictment that Menendez introduced a member of the Qatari royal family to a New Jersey businessman before the Qatari investor negotiated a multimillion dollar investment in a real estate venture planned by Fred Daibes, who was also charged in the initial bribery scheme indictment and pleaded not guilty. Mendenez allegedly accepted gifts in exchange for working to ensure the Qatari royal family member went through with the investment, including publicly speaking favorably about the government of Qatar.How the Media Covered It:Reports differed on whether the new information constitutes a new charge or just a new accusation. Aninitial reportfromABC News (Lean Left bias)stated that prosecutors announced new charges, but the outlet soon after issued a correction stating Menedez faced new \u201callegations contained in a superseding indictment, but not new charges.\u201dThe Daily Caller (Right bias)cited the initial ABC News report to state that new charges were announced and has not updated to reflect the correction as of 6:00 P.M.
