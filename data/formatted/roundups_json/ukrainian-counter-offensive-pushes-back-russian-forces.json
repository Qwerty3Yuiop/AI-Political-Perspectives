    "summary": "Followingmonthsof stalemates and grueling battles of attrition,Ukrainian forces appear to have turned the tide. A recently initiated counter-offensive campaign has erased gains made by invading Kremlin forces in the eastern region of the country and fractured the Russian frontline.Since it became clear early in thewarthat Russia underestimated the Ukrainians\u2019 military capabilities and will to resist reincorporation into the Russian system, the two sides have dug into their positions and made little gains. The start of Ukraine\u2019s highly anticipated counter-offensive has broken that routine.In the east near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in the country, reports stateUkrainian forces have advanced roughly 50 km, or about 30 miles, in three days. In the southern region bordering the Black Sea, where the Russians have pushed the furthest into the country, a Ukrainian advance is threatening to encircle Russian forces occupying the city of Kherson. Kherson fell to the Russians early in the war and is a crucial step in Moscow\u2019s march to Odesa, a port-city on the Black Sea that is economically vital for Kyiv and the continued resistance.The Ukrainian\u2019s advance was covered moderately across the spectrum, but was buried by the news ofQueen Elizabeth II\u2019s death. NBC News featured a quotation from NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg that was not present in most coverage, encouraging a continued stream of support for Ukraine from Western nations.",
