    "summary": "Roughly 23% of people in the U.S. ages five and older have yet to receive a COVID-19 vaccine dose. How should the the government and the rest of the American public respond to that?As of Monday,\u00a077% of Americans ages five and up have received at least one\u00a0dose. Tens of millions of eligible Americans haven't. Peopleperceive the vaccine and its effectiveness\u00a0differently across the spectrum, and some aremore concerned about side effects or confident in natural immunity.\u00a0In November, 49% of parents of kids ages 12-17responding to a Kaiser Family Foundation pollsaid their child was already vaccinated, 13% said they wanted to wait, and 30% said they definitely wouldn't have their child vaccinated.\u00a0For kids ages 5-11, 58% of parents said they either wanted to wait, would only do it if required, or said they definitely wouldn't do it.Writers for many left-rated outlets, as well assome\u00a0on the right, argue that the COVID-19 vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh the risks andcriticize peoplewho ignore that view. Other voices on the lefthighlight how\u00a0social, economic or racial inequitiesmay contribute to vaccination decisions. Many on the right saypoor public health leadership, rare but fatalCOVID -19 vaccine side effectsand the demonization of\u00a0skeptics play a big role in vaccine hesitancy. A scientist writing forForeign Policycalled on researchers to \"identify the roots that underlie vaccine hesitancy\" and urged that it be addressed \"as an emotional, social, and cultural problem.\"",
