    "summary": "In aninterviewwithMSNBC (Left bias)over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris took questions onthreats to democracy, immigration and more.When asked by host Chuck Todd aboutwhether\u00a0threats from within the U.S.pose a risk equal to or greater than the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Harris said current domestic threats are \"very dangerous\" and \"makes us weaker.\" She also called out \"11 people right now running for secretary of state, the keepers of the integrity of the voting system of their state, who are election deniers.\" Todd alsoasked Harris about immigration at the southern border, and she replied that\u00a0\"the border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular, over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed.\" The interview was Harris's most high-profile media appearance in months.Coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted Harris's remark about the border, and contrasted it with the fact thatroughly 5 million unauthorized migrantshaveentered the U.S.under Biden. Right-rated voices were highly critical of the remark; oneopinionfromWashington Examiner (Lean Right bias)called Harris \"cowardly and clueless.\" WriterJim Geraghty (Lean Right bias)said her answer to the border question was\"nonsense.\"Left- and center-rated sources covered the interview less, and none highlighted Harris's border remark. Instead, most reports from the left and center focused on her comments aboutelection deniers and threats to democracy.",
