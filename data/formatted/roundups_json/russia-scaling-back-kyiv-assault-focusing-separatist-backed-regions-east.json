    "summary": "Russia is scaling back itsassault on the Ukrainian capital of Kyivand other parts of the country in the face of stiff resistance, focusing instead on separatist-backed regimes in Eastern Ukraine\u00a0such as Donbas.While the siege of Kyiv\u00a0has been unsuccessful, Russia is declaring that the \"first stage of the operation\" has\u00a0been largely accomplished as strategy\u00a0changes are announced.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the bulk\u00a0of the Ukrainian army remains in eastern Ukraine in the hope\u00a0of keeping Russia from destroying their forces in the country's industrial center and possibly splitting the country in two.Media sources from the right, left, and center acknowledge\u00a0that the Russian pullback is a sign that their aspirations for a quick victory in\u00a0Kyiv have failed, or at least been derailed.",
