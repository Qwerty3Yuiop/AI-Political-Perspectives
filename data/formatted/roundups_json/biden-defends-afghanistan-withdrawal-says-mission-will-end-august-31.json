    "summary": "Speaking from the East Room of the White House on Thursday, President Joe Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, saying that the withdrawal was on track to end by August 31. \u201cThe United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cwe did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build.\u201d The remarks come amid renewed scrutiny of the withdrawal and just a week afterU.S. forces reportedly left Bagram Airfield, a key military base, \u201cin the dead of night\u201d without informing Afghan allies. Prior to Biden's remarks,\u00a0White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the U.S. would not have a celebratory \u201cmission accomplished moment\u201d over the end of the war.Coverage was prominently featured across the spectrum. Coverage in some right-rated outlets tended to frame the U.S. exit from Afghanistan less favorably, calling Psaki\u2019s \u201cno mission accomplished\u201d remarks \u201cgrim.\u201d",
