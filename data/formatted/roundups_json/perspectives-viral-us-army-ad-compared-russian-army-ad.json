    "summary": "AU.S. Army adwent viral last weekendafter a Twitter user\u00a0compared it to a Russian army adto show a difference in the tone and messaging. The Russian ad shows traditionally masculine men undergoing military fitness training, while\u00a0the American ad is a colorful cartoon telling the story of how Cpl. Emma Malonelord decided to join the military. She says she was \"raised by two moms\u201d and \u201cmarched for equality.\u201d The video shows her at her moms\u2019 wedding and holding signs at a rally before she states that she graduated at the top of her class and found \"a way to prove my inner strength\" by joining the U.S. Army.After the tweet went viral,\u00a0reactions were largely divided along the left and the right. Voices from the right pointed to the ad as a reflection of the \"feminization of U.S. society,\" as well as a reflection of a purported\u00a0shift in American ethos from \"sacrificing...in the name of a higher good\" to \"glorifying\" and \"elevating\" oneself.Sen. Ted Cruz\u00a0tweeted, \u201cHoly crap. Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea....\u201d \u00a0Cruz received some criticism\u00a0for purportedly implying\u00a0that the\u00a0Russian military was better than America's. Voices from the left also criticized Cruz, saying\u00a0it\u00a0doesn\u2019t matter who joins the military because in the end they will be effectively trained to\u00a0serve. Some on the left also said that the U.S. ad\u00a0recruits\u00a0by appealing to what makes Americans consider their country worth defending, while the Russian ad does this by appealing to \"angry young men looking for a violent outlet.\"",
