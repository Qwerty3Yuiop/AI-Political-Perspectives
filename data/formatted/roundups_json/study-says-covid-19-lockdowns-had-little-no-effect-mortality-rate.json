    "headline": "Study Says Covid 19 Lockdowns Had Little No Effect Mortality Rate",
    "summary": "COVID-19 lockdowns\u00a0in the U.S. and Europe \"should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument,\" according to researchers\u00a0led by the head of Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics.The group's62-page studyfound that lockdowns \"reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average,\" while also \"reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy.\" Researchers conducted a statistical analysis combining\u00a0the results of multiple scientific studies on COVID-19 and public health lockdowns. It was co-authored by Scandinavian economic advisers Jonas Herby and Lars Jonung, along with Steve H. Hanke,\u00a0professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. Some researchers suggested early\u00a0in the pandemicthat lockdowns were among the best ways to curb the pandemic and reduce COVID-19 mortality; other scientists opposed lockdowns from the beginning andargued that they'd do more harm than good.Very few left- and center-rated outlets covered the research. Right-rated news outlets covered it prominently, and tended to highlight scientists who condemned lockdowns as ineffective early in the pandemic. Right-rated voices often framed the study as more evidence of COVID-19 public health restrictions not working, being based on faulty science, and\u00a0harming society\u00a0by keeping businesses closed and kids out of school.Snopes (Lean Left bias)highlighted the fact thatthe paper hasn't been peer-reviewedor endorsed by Johns Hopkins. A\u00a0report from Fortune mentions that the lead researchers \"are clearly free marketers,\" but also that\u00a0\"their academic standing, the vast quantities of data they analyzed, and their sophisticated methodology make a strong case for their conclusions.\"Updated 2/4/22 to reflect Snopes's coverage.",
