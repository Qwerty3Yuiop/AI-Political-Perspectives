    "headline": "Examining Chinas Role Russia Ukraine Conflict",
    "summary": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin continues his invasion of Ukraine, China's allegiances and purported plans to get involved are in the spotlight.Reports across the spectrum suggest thatChina has\u00a0shown a willingness to provide military support to Russia. As Russian forces reportedly run low on supplies, the country\u00a0is believed to have asked China for \u200bequipment and other support. During a phone call with Russian leaders a day after the invasion, China's foreign minister said China \"respects each country's sovereignty and territorial integrity\" but also understands \"Russia's reasonable concern on security issues.\"\u00a0Weeks before the invasion, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met andreleased a joint statementtouting their\u00a0\"no limits\" partnership.Right-rated voices often\u00a0called on the U.S. to take more steps to aid Ukraine and limit the impact of Chinese assistance for Russia. Some compared Putin's invasion to\u00a0China's purported plans to take over Taiwan, and stressed the importance of Russian failure in Ukraine in order to make China reconsider. Writing a guest essay for the New York Times, the founder of a Beijing-based think tank that advises the Chinese government argued that China could mediate a solution to the conflict that would give Putin \"sufficient security assurances\" and protect\u00a0\"Ukraine\u2019s core sovereignty,\" and said \"there is no country better placed to do so.\" A writer forNational Review (Right bias)responded to that essay,accusing\u00a0the Times of publishing Chinese propagandaand downplaying the writer's connections to the Chinese government.",
