    "summary": "Some media outlets and pundits across the spectrum have expressed skepticism that the Biden administration is \u201coverstating\u201d jobs numbers in its May report.Overstated Jobs Report:ZeroHedge (Lean Right bias)published an opinion that said that while the Establishment Survey claimed the U.S. added 272,000 payrolls, the actual number of employed workers fell by 408,000 according to the Household Survey. ZeroHedge noted that while speaking to aBloomberg (Lean Left bias)reporter the other day, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powellsaid, \u201cThere is an argument that [payrolls] may be a bit overstated.\u201dUnusual Divergence:Liz Peek (Lean Right bias), writing forThe Hill (Center bias), noted the same figures as ZeroHedge and Powell\u2019s comment as well. She said the two surveys don\u2019t always move in lockstep, but they are normally somewhat compatible,\u201d and called divergence on the May report \u201cunusual.\u201d Peek concluded that the report will likely be revised, and criticized the Biden administration for lying \u201cconstantly and comfortably\u201d about the economy with figures such as inflation.Underlying Weakness:An analysis from Bloomberg noted that the 272,000 payrolls added were \u201cfar ahead of the 180,000 that economists had expected,\u201d but that the 408,000 loss in jobs \u201cis a harbinger of what\u2019s ahead.\u201d Bloomberg cited other metrics like job openings and consumer spending as underlying bellwethers of economic weakness in the U.S. and concluded that recent overall jobs growth \u201cmay have been overstated.\u201d",
