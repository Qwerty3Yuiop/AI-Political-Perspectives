    "summary": "The U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of\u00a06.5% in the second quarter of 2021, according to aBureau of Economic Analysis reportreleased Thursday. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew\u00a01.6% from Q1 of 2021, and is now higher than it was before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some economic analysts and experts reportedly expected annualized Q2 growth to be closer to 8.5%.Left-rated outlets often focused on the rapid pace of growth, quoting optimistic sources and placing\u00a0less attention on the fact that the final number missed economists' expectations. Center- and right-rated outlets highlighted the growth while also framing it as underwhelming, attributing the shortcomings\u00a0to labor shortages, supply chain issues, and concerns about the Delta variant.",
