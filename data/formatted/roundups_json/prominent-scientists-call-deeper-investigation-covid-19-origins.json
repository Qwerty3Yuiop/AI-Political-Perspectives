    "summary": "Aletterwritten to the academic journalScienceby 18 prominent scientists called for deeper investigations into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,\" said the letter. \"Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.\" The scientists also criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) for its original probe into the disease's genesis and initial conclusion that a lab leak was \"extremely unlikely.\"\n\nThe letter was covered by many center- and right-rated outlets, with the right often covering it more prominently and framing the WHO and China in a negative light. Notably fewer left-rated outlets offered original reporting on the letter. Some right-rated voicesalso arguedthat the letter \"disarms the cynical instrumentalization of the fight against anti-Asian racism\" purportedly advanced by people who called the lab leak hypothesis a conspiracy.",
