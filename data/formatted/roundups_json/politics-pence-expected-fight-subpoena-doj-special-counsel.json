    "summary": "Former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to challenge asubpoenafrom Justice Department Special CounselJack Smithfor him\u00a0to testify on former President Donald Trump's role in theJan.\u00a06 Capitol riot.The Details: The subpoena request makes Pence the highest-raking official known to have been summoned by the special counsel.Key Quotes: A source familiar with Pence's legal strategytoldPolitico (Lean Left bias)that Pence \"thinks that the 'speech or debate' clause is a core protection for Article I, for the legislature. He feels it really goes to the heart of some separation of powers issues. He feels duty-bound to maintain that protection, even if it means litigating it.\"For Context: Pence's argument will likely not center on his role as vice president\u00a0and executive privilege, but rather on his role as former president of the Senate. In that role, he was considered a member of the legislative branch, which would protect him from certain Justice Department requests.How the Media Covered it: Pence's plan\u00a0to resist the subpoena was covered by sources across the political spectrum, with media on the right and left mentioning the \"speech and debate clause,\" which normally protects members of Congress from any lawsuits stemming\u00a0from what they say during legislative sessions.",
