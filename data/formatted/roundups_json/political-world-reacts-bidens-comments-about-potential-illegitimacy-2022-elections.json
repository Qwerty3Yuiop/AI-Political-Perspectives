    "summary": "In a rare press conference on Wednesday, President Joe Biden made\u00a0remarks about election legitimacy\u00a0that heightened political tensions.In response to a question about potential illegitimacy in\u00a0the 2022 midterm elections, Biden said \"it easily could be\u00a0illegitimate. Imagine\u00a0if, in fact, Trump has succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.\" The reporter then clarified that they were\u00a0asking about the 2022 elections rather than 2020, and Biden added \"...I'm not going to say it's going to be legit. It's the increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these reforms passed.\"\u00a0White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said later that Biden\"was not casting doubt\"on the legitimacy of the 2022 midterms, and accused former President Donald Trump of \"putting our democracy at risk\" withcontinued claims about 2020 election fraud.Coverage was more common from right-rated sources, which\u00a0often framed Biden's remarks as confusing andpotentially dangerous; some reports framed Psaki and Vice President Kamala Harris asdodging questionsabout the remarks or doubling down on Biden's comments. Reports from left-rated sources tended to focus on clarifications from Psaki and\u00a0Harris.ABC News (Lean Left bias) reportedthat Psaki and Harris \"worked to dispel\" mistrust in elections that Biden's comments could have caused.\u00a0Reports fromAxios (Center bias),Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)and others\u00a0framed Biden's \"easily could be illegitimate\" comment as being about the 2022 elections; CNN\u00a0implied that Biden misunderstood the question and was instead referring to 2020 with that comment.",
