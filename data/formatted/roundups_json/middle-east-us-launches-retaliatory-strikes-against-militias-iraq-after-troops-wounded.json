    "summary": "President Joe Biden ordered retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq on Tuesday after a drone attack on Erbil Air Base wounded 3 U.S. service members.The Details:The airstrikes targeted \u201cthree locations utilized by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups\u201d and \u201cfocused specifically on unmanned aerial drone activities.\u201d However, the Iraqi government said the strikes killed one of its service members and wounded 18 others. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani\u2019s office called the U.S. strikes \u201chostile acts\u201d that violated Iraq\u2019s sovereignty.For Context:The U.S. designated Kataib Hezbollah, a Shia militant group,\u00a0a terrorist organization\u00a0in 2009. A senior Kataib Hezbollah official quoted byThe Washington Post (Lean Left bias)said the group\u2019s initial attacks were carried out because itopposed America\u2019s support for Israeland continued troop presence in Iraq.Other militant groups, like the Houthis, have also launched rocket and drone attacks against Western forces in the region since the war in Gaza began.How the Media Covered It:Some headlines in right-rated outlets simply noted \u201cHezbollah\u201d attacks, potentially conflating the Iraq-based Kataib Hezbollah with the Hezbollah that acts as a political party and militant group in Lebanon. While most coverage was fairly similar, The Washington Post stood out by prominently noting growing \u201canger in the Middle East\u201d over Gaza\u2019s 20,000-person death toll.Al Jazeera (Lean Left bias)stood out by saying Kataib Hezbollah\u2019s attacks were merely \u201cblamed on\u201d them.",
