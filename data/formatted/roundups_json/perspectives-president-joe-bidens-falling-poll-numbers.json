    "summary": "President Joe Biden's approval ratings are falling, according to\u00a0several national polls conducted over the past week.\u00a0 The FiveThirtyEight\u00a0polling average says\u00a0an aggregate of 49.2% of voters disapprove\u00a0of Biden's presidency, while 44.5% approve.\u00a0 Polls suggest that support for Biden has declined in particular\u00a0among key Democratic constituencies, including Latinos, black people, women and young people; some also suggest the drop is due\u00a0to the disorderly\u00a0U.S. exit from Afghanistan and from the rise of the COVID-19 delta variant.Media from the right, left and center shared\u00a0perspectives on the decline in Biden's approval rating, with many suggesting that despite the fact that attention on Afghanistan is fading\u00a0andCOVID-19 cases are falling, Biden's approval ratings haven't recovered.",
