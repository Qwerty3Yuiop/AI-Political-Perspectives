    "summary": "Vice President Kamala Harris's remarks abouthow to distribute\u00a0emergency aid to those affected byHurricane Ianwere met with criticism, especially from Republicans in Florida.Speakingat a Democratic National Committee event on Friday, Harris said that hurricane relief aid \"is aboutgiving resources based on equity, understanding that we fight for equality, but we also need to fight for equity.\" She added that \"It is our lowest-income communities and our communities of color that are most impacted by these extreme conditions and impacted by issues that are not of their own making.\"Christina Pushaw, the Rapid Response Director for the Florida governor's office,tweetedthat Harris's statement was false and that \"FEMA Individual Assistance isalready available to all Floridians impacted by Hurricane Ian, regardless of race or background.\" FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell stated that \"there are people that often have a hard time accessing our programs\" while reiterating that \"all Floridians are going to be able to get the help that is available to them through our programs.\"Right-rated outlets covered Harris's remarks much morethan left- and center-rated outlets did, and many framed them as racist and insensitive. The few reports from the left and center about Harris's comments tended to focus on the FEMA administrator's comments.",
