    "summary": "On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0added policy positions to hercampaign websitefor the first time since launching her run for the White House\u00a0in July.Key Details: The website, under the banner\u00a0\"A New Way Forward\" is centered around four topics:\u00a0Build an Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs for Families,\u00a0Safeguard Our Fundamental Freedoms,\u00a0Ensure Safety and Justice For All, and\u00a0Keep America Safe, Secure, and Prosperous. After listing Harris' plans under each topic, the website contrasts each topic to theProject 2025Agenda.\u00a0Project 2025 is a proposal by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which former President Donald Trump has not endorsed. Parts of the Harris platform werereportedlycopied directly from Biden\u2019s campaign page.Key Quote: The Harris campaign website says,\u00a0\"Under her plan, the tax rate on long-term capital gains for those earning a million dollars a year or more will be 28 percent, because when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger.\" The Trump War Room accountresponded to the policy platformon X, formerly Twitter, as follows:\u00a0\"Kamala finally has what is very generously being described as a 'policy page' on her website. She says her plan is a 'New Way Forward,' but she's been in the White House for 4 years, and it's been a total disaster.\"For Context: Previously, the website had pages to get to know Harris, donate, or buy merchandise but did not contain any policy proposals.How the Media Covered it:Fox News(Right bias) noted that Harris' website claims Trump would restrict in vitro fertilization (IVF)and ban abortion, though Trump has stated he would consider making insurance companies or the government cover IVF costs, and that he would not enact a federal abortion ban.The Guardian(Lean left bias) noted that while Trump is distancing himself from Project 2025, many of the authors and groups behind the project have\u00a0ties to Trump, and that many of the policy goals align with actions that Trump has said he would take if he wins in November.",
