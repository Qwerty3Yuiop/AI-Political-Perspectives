    "headline": "Coronavirus New Analysis Suggests Wuhan Raccoon Dogs Possible Origin Covid 19",
    "summary": "A new analysis by an international group of researchers\u00a0found evidence that COVID-19 originated from infected animals sold at a market in Wuhan, China.The Details:A French scientist uncovered genetic data uploaded by Chinese researchers to the global virology database GISAID. The data suggested raccoon dogs sold at the market could have been carrying the virus; it\u00a0disappeared from the database shortly after appearing, but the findings were presented to the World Health Organization on Tuesday.For Context:The findings come just weeks after the U.S. Department of Energychanged its\u00a0stanceon COVID-19's\u00a0origins to believing it likely\u00a0leaked from a lab in Wuhan, rather than originating through natural transmission. The\u00a0change prompted widespread\u00a0media coverage and debate. The new analysis, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, was first reported on byThe Atlantic (Left bias). Several of the analysis\u2019 authors reached\u00a0similar conclusions in a February 2022 analysis that was first shared withThe New York Times (Lean left).How The Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum weighed the claim differently, but most agreed it doesn't prove anything for certain.Washington Examiner (Lean Right)elevated comments from a Rutgers University lab director who said\u00a0the claim \u201cshould not be taken at face value\u201d because the data cited \u201chas not been made available for analysis.\u201d",
