    "summary": "Amid House Republican infighting, Congress is struggling to fund the government by the end of the month to avert apartial government shutdown.Key Details: On Tuesday, Republican leadershipscrapped a procedural voteaimed at keeping the government open through October. The White House is not attempting to patch together another bill and wants Speaker Kevin McCarthy to stick to thespending dealhe struck in May with President Biden.Key Quote: \u201cA lot of Republicans want to solve all our spending in a CR [Continuing Resolution].\u00a0We need to solve that in appropriations bills. But we want to fix the border, [and] we\u2019ve got to have disaster relief,\u201d one GOP lawmaker said.For Context: McCarthy and Biden agreed in May to fiscal 2024 appropriations that were $120 billion more than the topline of $1.47 trillion that some House Republicans\u00a0are pushing for.How the Media is Covering it: Some right-rated outlets\u00a0noted Democrats who might be willing to negotiate with their Republican colleagues if the deal maintains\u00a0current government spending and includes items like\u00a0provisions for\u00a0Ukraine. Some left-rated sources focused on the\u00a0reasoning behind the White House's decision to steer clear of last-minute budget negotiations.",
