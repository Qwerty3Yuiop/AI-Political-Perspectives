    "summary": "On Monday, Russia announced that its\u00a0missiles had\u00a0destroyed an airport in the industrial city of Dnipro, Ukraine, where four S-300 missile launchers were reportedly hidden.The action\u00a0seems to be a push to take out weapons obtained by Ukraine from European\u00a0countries, and an effort to gain Russian air superiority; Russia says the missile launchers\u00a0were \"delivered to the Kyiv regime by a European country.\" The failure to obtain\u00a0complete control of Ukraine's skies has limited Russia's ability to advance their troops without incurring greater losses, and Moscow has recently begun targeting airports andtrain stations.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that he\u00a0had\u00a0contacted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about the possibility of an embargo on Russian oil and gas, but Germany so far has resisted this move.",
