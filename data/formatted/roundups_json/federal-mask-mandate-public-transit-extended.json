It was set to expire Friday. The announcement said the extension will give the CDC\u00a0time to \"inform a revised policy framework\" for mask-wearing on public transit \"based on the Covid-19 community levels, risk of new variants, national data, and the latest science.\" Federal mask guidance has eased in recent weeks, as theCDC rolled back requirements in most of the U.S.last month.\u00a0No statewide mask mandates will be in effect once Hawaii's expires on March 26.Reports across the spectrum highlighted some voices who argued that the extension was unneeded. Some coverage from left- and center-rated sources focused on how TSA says the extended mandate will give the CDC time to develop new policy. Some reports from right-rated sources framed the extended mandate as unnecessary and\u00a0being at odds with overall CDC guidance.",
