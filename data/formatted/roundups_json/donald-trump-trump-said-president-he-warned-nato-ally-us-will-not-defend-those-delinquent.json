    "summary": "Donald Trump recounteda conversation he had with a NATO leader while President on Saturday, in which he said the U.S. would not protect a NATO ally delinquent on dues.Direct Quote:\u201cI did the same thing with NATO. I got them to pay up. NATO was busted until I came along. I said, \u2018Everybody\u2019s gonna pay.\u2019 They said, \u2018Well, if we don\u2019t pay are you going to protect us?\u2019 I said, \u2018Absolutely not.\u2019\u2026 You never saw more money pour in\u2026.\u201d Trump added, \u201cOne of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, \u2018Well sir, if we don\u2019t pay, and we\u2019re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?\u2019 I said\u2026 \u2018No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.\u2019\u201dFor Context:Trump\u2019s comments came amidst gripes over the disparity between European and U.S. aid to Ukraine, and how Ukraine can sever ties with NATO for a closer relationship with Russia at any time.White House Response:White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, \u201cEncouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged \u2013 and it endangers American national security, global stability, and our economy at home.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:Most media across the spectrum framed headlines around Trump\u2019s \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d comment, but made it clear it was relative to delinquent payments. Some outlets, likeForbes (Center bias)andThe Atlantic (Left bias)publishedsensational headlinespegged on the news, but were actually foropinion commentary.",
