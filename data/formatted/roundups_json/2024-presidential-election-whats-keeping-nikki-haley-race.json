    "summary": "After losing theRepublican primary in her home state of South Carolina, voices across the spectrum are speculating as to why Nikki Haley is continuing her presidential campaign.From the Center:An analysis in theWall Street Journal (Center bias)determined Haley is \u201cdemonstrating the inconvenient fact that a sizable portion of the Republican primary electorate isn\u2019t on board with another Donald Trump nomination, no matter how inevitable it seems.\u201d The piece cited how Haley received 40% of the vote in South Carolina, a \u201cremarkable showing for a candidate with no plausible path to victory.\u201dFrom the Left:A writer inCNN Opinion (Left bias)argued that \u201cHaley\u2019s increasingly sharp criticism of the former president stands out in a party whose leaders are, for the most part, eager to show the MAGA universe that they are true Trump believers, whatever they may say in private.\u201d Despite her continued resistance against Trump, the writer did not dismiss the possibility that before November, Haley would end up, using her own words, \u201ckiss the ring\u201d and endorse Trump.From the Right:A writer in theWashington Times (Lean Right bias)argued Haley is going through the stages of grief and is suffering \u201cdelusions of victory.\u201d The writer stated that Haley\u2019s true goal was to \u201close to Mr. Trump in her own home state with less terrible numbers than she had lost to Mr. Trump in New Hampshire. Well, by every measure, she failed.\u201d The writer concluded, \u201cSome people can never get enough humiliation.\u201d",
