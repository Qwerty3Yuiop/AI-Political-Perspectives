    "summary": "Software antivirus entrepreneur\u00a0John McAfee purportedly committed suicide\u00a0in his prison cell in Spain on Wednesday, after a Spanish court ruled he would be extradited to the U.S. to face charges of tax evasion, which carried a sentence of up to 30 years.\u00a0McAfee was arrested at a Spanish airport in October, and spent the following months until now in a Spanish prison.The Associated Press reportedthat Tennessee prosecutors said McAfee owed the U.S. government over $4 million in taxes\u00a0from fiscal years 2014-2018, but the National Court judge extradited him\u00a0to face charges from only 2016-2018. McAfee argued several weeks ago that prosecutors in the U.S. were politically motivated, and that were he to go back and face the charges, he would spend the rest of his life in prison.\u00a0Spanish authorities said an initial investigation uncovered no signs of foul play,according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.\u00a0McAfee's attorney, Nishay Sanan, said McAfee will be remembered as a \"fighter,\" and that \u201che tried to love this country but the\u00a0US government made his existence impossible. They tried to erase him but they failed.\"\u00a0Sanan also said as of Wednesday afternoon, there was no confirmation regarding the cause of McAfee's death.Outlets across the spectrum covered\u00a0McAfee's tax evasion charges and death.\u00a0Some\u00a0outlets highlighted McAfee's\u00a0\"eccentric\" personal history, his use of social media to promote controverisal or false theories, and his history of\u00a0run-ins with the law.\u00a0Some on social media suggested foul play surrounding McAfee's suicide, and pointed toMcAfee's post from 2019, in which McAfee claimed U.S. officials were \"coming for him\" and said \"If I suicide myself, I didn't. I was whackd.\"\u00a0Hours after his death, McAfee's Instagram account apparentlyposted a picture of the letter \"Q\".",
