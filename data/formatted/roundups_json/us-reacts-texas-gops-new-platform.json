    "summary": "Texas Republicansapproved a\u00a0platformthis week that, among other things, rejects the 2020 presidential election\u00a0results and labels\u00a0homosexuality an \u201cabnormal lifestyle choice.\u201d How did the political world respond?Democrats rejected the platform as extreme and anti-LGBTQ+.\u00a0Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said the Texas GOP\u00a0\"is completely controlled by the right-wing extremists.\"Few Republicans outside of Texas commented on the platform, and those that did tended to criticize\u00a0it. Donald Trump Jr.said\"The Texas GOP should focus its energy on fighting back against the radical Democrats and weak RINOs currently trying to legislate our 2nd Amendment rights away, instead of canceling a group of gay conservatives who are standing in the breach with us.\"\u00a0The chairman of Texas's\u00a0Log Cabin Republicans, an organization within the Republican Party that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights,saidthe platform was pushed by\u00a0\"a small minority of people that are being un-Christian-like and spewing this hateful language.\"Many on the left and center harshly criticized the platform, and framed Texas Republicans as anti-LGBTQ+. Some voices on the left, such theWashington Post's (Lean Left bias)Dana Milbank, supported the Texas GOP's desire to secede and highlighted the $83 billion the U.S. would save annually in defense funds that Texas receives. Few right-rated voices commented on the platform. Some LGBTQ+ writers on the right, such as Washington Examiner's Brad Polumbo, accused Texas Republicans of alienating LGBTQ+ conservatives and called the\u00a0platform \"counterproductive.\"",
