    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) canceled a vote on a temporary spending bill that would keep federal agencies and programs funded for six months.The Details:The decision came after it became clear that the spending bill, known as a continuing resolution (CR), lacked enough support to pass.\u00a0The CR included the\u00a0GOP\u2019s SAVE Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration.\u00a0A\u00a0dozen Republican lawmakers recently withdrew support from the bill, citing national security and fiscal concerns.Key Quotes:Many Republicans support the SAVE Act, but want the CR to be less than six months. \"[Congress will] probably wind up with some clean CR. The shorter the better because long CRs really do hurt military readiness,\u201d\u00a0said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).\u00a0\u201cI love the idea of the SAVE Act being on a CR. I\u2019d prefer it not be six months,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND). \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of kicking the can that far down the road. I think it\u2019s just a license to not do anything for six months.\u201dFor Context:Congressional leaders must pass a stopgap spending bill before October 1 to avoid a partial government shutdown.How the Media Covered It:The Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)quotedconcerns raised by Senate Republicans regarding military readiness and potential for a government shutdown.The Associated Press\u00a0(Lean Left bias)mentionedthe Democrats' opposition to the bill and the SAVE Act and highlighted ongoing efforts for bipartisan support.An editor wrote this summary with the help of AllSides\u00a0AI.",
