    "summary": "The\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday night announced the termination of\u00a0the COVID-19 testing requirement for international\u00a0air travelers entering the U.S.CDC\u00a0Director Rochelle Walensky said the 17-month-old mandate will be lifted on Sunday at 12:01 a.m. ET. The health agencyconcludedthat the testing requirement is \"not currently necessary\" to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \"In its place,\" Walensky believes travelers\u00a0have access to enough tools and guidance to make their own \"informed choices.\" Those who are not U.S. citizens, however, must still\u00a0show proof of vaccination before boarding their flight. The CDC said it will reassess the decision\u00a0in 90 days and could reinstate the testing requirement\u00a0if there was a \"concerning new variant.\"Prominent voices in the\u00a0travel industry have lobbied\u00a0the Biden administration to drop the travel restrictions, arguing that the policy has prevented many Americans from\u00a0traveling internationally. Since the current rule mandates travelers to test negative within 24 hours of their departure, some Americans have expressed concerns that\u00a0they would \"test positive and be stranded abroad.\"Outlets across the spectrum similarly highlighted how \"both Republicans and some Democrats\" have suggested the \"outdated\" testing requirement should\u00a0be dropped.",
