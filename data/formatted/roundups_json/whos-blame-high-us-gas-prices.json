    "summary": "Already-lofty U.S. gas prices hit a record high this week. Where should Americans place blame?The average price of\u00a0gas\u00a0in the U.S. rose to $4.25/gallon Wednesday, according to AAA, afterhitting an all-time high of $4.17the day before. In response, governors from both major parties havecalled for gas taxes to be suspended. Meanwhile, the Biden administrationbanned\u00a0imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coalin response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. President Joe Biden acknowledged that the move could raise\u00a0costs for U.S. consumers and pledged to \"minimize Putin\u2019s price hike here at home.\"\u00a0Rising costs\u00a0haverevived debates over clean energy and oil dependence, and sparked disagreements over what's causing higher prices and how to reduce them.Right-rated voices often blame price spikes on Biden'spurportedly restrictive energy policies and blind\u00a0focus on clean energy, and often frame those positions\u00a0asobstacles to lowering costs. Left-rated voices have been less emphatic in placing blame, and tend to highlight Russia's invasion as the key reason for currently high gas prices.\u00a0Sources across the spectrum agree\u00a0that high prices pose trouble for Biden and Democrats in the2022 midterm elections, and many sources on all sides highlighted how consumers are being affected. Some coverage from left-rated sources focused on how high prices areimpacting minorities and low-income communities.
