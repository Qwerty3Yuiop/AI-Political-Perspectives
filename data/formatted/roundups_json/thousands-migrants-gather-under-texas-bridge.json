    "summary": "Roughly 10,000 unauthorized migrants have gathered under a bridge along the Mexico-U.S. border in Del Rio, Texas\u00a0and are waiting to be taken into U.S. custody. Del Rio mayor Bruno Lozanotweeted Thursdaysaying 2,000 more migrants had shown up that day and asking\u00a0if President Joe Biden had been briefed on the situation. A statement from Border Patrol said water, towels and portable toilets had\u00a0been provided to the migrants as they await processing.\u00a0Sources across the spectrum say the people are mostly\u00a0Haitian, and are joined by some Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. Republican lawmakers and conservatives have criticized Biden for purportedly enabling the situation.Nearly 200,000 migrants were arrested at the southern border in Augustas migrant apprehensions remain near a 20-year high.The situation has been covered prominently by right-rated outlets and has been less of a focus for left- and center-rated outlets. Some coverage from left-rated sources said the migrants were \"being held\" under the bridge; most other reports described the migrants as having \"converged\" under the bridge and \"waiting\" to be taken into\u00a0custody. Coverage across the spectrum, especially\u00a0from right-rated outlets, framed the situation as another immigration crisis for Biden. Right-rated sources also\u00a0often highlighted a temporary Federal Aviation Administration ban on drones near the bridge, which has since been lifted; Fox News (Right bias) had previously been documenting the situation with drone footage.Updated 9/17/21 at 5:51 p.m. ET",
