I will not be involved in a presidential run,\u201d the centrist senator said in a speech at West Virginia University, adding, \u201cI am not going to be a deal breaker, if you will, a spoiler.\u201dFor Context:Manchin\u2019s remarks were an apparent break from his comments a day earlier, when he floated Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Rob Portman (R-OH) as running mates in a hypothetical presidential campaign. Manchin was in West Virginia touring with his daughter's campaign group \u201cAmericans Together,\u201d which seeks to support the \u201cmoderate majority\u201d and reject \u201cextremism in politics.\u201d Manchin previously frustrated congressional Democrats early in President Joe Biden\u2019s term by insisting on more moderate versions of Biden\u2019s legislative proposals.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was widespread and relatively straightforward across the spectrum Friday morning.The New Republic (Left bias)stood out by highlighting that Manchin\u2019s concern about being a \u201cspoiler\u201d was \u201cexactly what everyone had been warning him about for the last year.\u201d",
