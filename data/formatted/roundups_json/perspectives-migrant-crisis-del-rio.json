    "summary": "Aninflux of migrants crossing the Rio Grande River into Texashas created a crisis in the town of Del Rio.\u00a0Over16,000 unauthorized migrantswere reportedly present at a makeshift camp under a bridge in Del Rio over the weekend. Border Patrol agents have started to apprehend migrants, and roughly 1,000 had been deported to Haiti as of Tuesday. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Tuesday at a Senate hearing that \"dramatic results\" would help\u00a0disperse the camp \"in the next 48 to 96 hours.\"\u00a0Criticizing President Joe Biden's handling of the situation, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Tuesday that the White House\u00a0needs \"to up its game, big time.\"Coverage from left-rated outlets often focused on how the migrants arrived in Del Rio and what's next for them; some highlightedphotos of Border Patrol agents on horseback attempting to apprehend migrants, with some describing the agents as \"whipping\" people; Border Patrol hasrejected that characterization. Some left-rated voices criticized Biden for deporting the migrants rather than processing them as asylum seekers. Many right-rated voices said the situation was another example of Biden's failure on immigration. Others\u00a0accused the left of focusing on Border Patrol's handling of the\u00a0situation instead of the White House's, as they purportedly would have if former President Trump was in office.",
