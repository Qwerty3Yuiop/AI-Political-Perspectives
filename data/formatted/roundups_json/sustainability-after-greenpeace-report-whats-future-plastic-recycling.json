    "summary": "\"Most plastic simply cannot be recycled,\" said Greenpeace in arecent report. What's next?For Context:The report estimates that only 4.7% of U.S. household plastics were recycled in 2021, and\u00a0says \"plastic waste is extremely difficult to collect, virtually impossible to sort for recycling, environmentally harmful to reprocess, often made of and contaminated by toxic materials, and not economical to recycle.\"\u00a0As of 2018, theofficial plastic recycling ratewas 8.7%, according to\u00a0the Environmental Protection Agency.Key Quotes:Greenpeace USA's senior plastics campaigner called for a \"Global Plastics Treaty that will finally end the age of plastic by significantly decreasing production and increasing refill and reuse.\" The CEO of the Plastics Industry Associationresponded, saying that Greenpeace \"cannot call themselves environmentalists while simultaneously discouraging recycling as part of the solution to our world\u2019s waste problems.\"How the Media Covered It:Left- and center-rated coverage of the Greenpeace report often focused on how to reduce\u00a0plastic usage and improve\u00a0recycling effectiveness. Some right-ratednews outletsandwritersframed the report as evidence that recycling in general is nonsensical.\u00a0A writer for City Journal argued that \"plastic edicts\" unjustly enable politicians and environmentalists \"to exercise power and pretend to be saviors of the planet.\"The Good News:A new firm\u00a0istransforming broken,\u00a0tough-to-recycle solar panelsfrom landfill waste to valuable raw materials.",
