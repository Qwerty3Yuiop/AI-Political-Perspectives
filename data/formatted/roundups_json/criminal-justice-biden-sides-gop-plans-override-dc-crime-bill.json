City Council approved the\u00a0new code late last year,\u00a0overriding\u00a0a veto from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D).For Context:The move aligns Biden with Republicans and against Democrats and local leaders amid anational partisan feud over the penal system. Progressives\u00a0have pushed to reduce sentencing and penalties, especially for nonviolent crimes, and often point to overcrowded prisons and racial biases in the justice system. Conservatives have pushed to maintain or strengthen penalties, and point to crime in places like D.C., where the number of crimes likecarjackingandhomicidehave risen steadily in recent years.Key Quotes:Biden believes in \"making sure that the streets in America and communities across the country are safe,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for me and anybody who believes in home rule, honestly,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA). Biden's move \"acknowledged the basic fact that soft-on-crime policies endanger the public,\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) said.How the Media Covered It:Sources across the spectrum highlighted the divide\u00a0between Biden and progressives, and noted how D.C.'s City Council is strongly progressive, how Biden's move angered some Democrats, and how D.C. crime has worsened recently.",
