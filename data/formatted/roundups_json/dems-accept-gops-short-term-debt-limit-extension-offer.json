    "headline": "Dems Accept Gops Short Term Debt Limit Extension Offer",
    "summary": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) acceptedan offerThursday from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to raise the debt limit into December.McConnell said his offer\u00a0gives Democrats time to increase the debt limit through budget reconciliation, which would allow it to pass without any GOP votes. Multiple Democrats reportedly indicated support for the deal Wednesday, though they oppose using reconciliation to raise the debt limit. Some Democrats see McConnell's\u00a0offer as giving them more time to work out the spending package, which is currently held up by\u00a0centrist Democrats who oppose the $3.5 trillion price tag. Other Democrats have accused McConnell and Republicans of politicizing the debt ceiling situation instead of acting quickly to avoida potential economic recession.\u00a0McConnell has repeatedly told Democrats to raise the debt limit with reconciliation since they already plan to use it\u00a0to pass the Biden administration's multi-trillion dollar spending package.The news wascovered prominently across the political media spectrum, with most reports highlighting how Democrats were unsatisfied with the proposal but ultimately planned to accept and\u00a0delay the issue. Coverage from right-rated sources sometimes framed the news as McConnell having\u00a0\"called Democrats' bluff.\"\u00a0Reports from left-rated outlets sometimes highlighted remarks from Democratic lawmakers who said McConnell caved to Democratic demands to stop delaying action on the debt ceiling.Updated 10/7/21 at 11:05 a.m. to include Schumer's acceptance.",
