    "summary": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi left Taiwan on Wednesdayafter a visit that some called \u201ccourageous\u201d and others called \u201cutterly reckless.\u201dIn response, China conductedmilitary drillsin the Taiwan Straitand imposed import limits on hundreds of Taiwanese products. Pelosi, who has longcriticizedChina\u2019s human rights record,waved offChina\u2019s military response, saying, \u201cwhatever China was going to do they'll do in their own good time.\u201d The House speaker also suggested Chinese President Xi Jingping was \u201crattling his saber\u201d because of potential \u201cinsecurities\u201d about his \u201cpolitical situation.\u201dPerspectives on Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan cut across the usual partisan divides.Pelosi\u2019s supporters included the Editors of theNational Review (Right bias), who called the trip\u201ccourageous\u201dand said Pelosi \u201cgrasps what China appeasers don\u2019t.\u201d Meanwhile,The Washington Post (Lean Left bias)Editorial Board called the visit\u201cunwise,\u201dnot because Pelosi didn\u2019t have an \u201cobligation\u201d to visit Taiwan, but because it was done atthe wrong time.Some outlets published perspectives from Taiwanese writers,who tended to argue\u00a0that Chinese threats were not a cause for panic. TheTaipei Times (Center bias)published an editorial praising\u201cplucky Pelosi\u201dand labeling \u201cChina\u2019s propagandists\u201d as \u201cpaper tigers\u201d with empty threats. However, the Hong Kong-basedSouth China Morning Post (Center bias)criticized Pelosi\u2019s\u201cshort-sighted\u201dvisit for purportedly making the region \u201ca more dangerous place.\u201d",
