But while prices of gasoline and used cars\u00a0fell and rising\u00a0food costs slowed slightly, the cost of shelter continued to rise. Housing costs, including rents and home prices,rose 0.7% in August from the previous month and\u00a06.2% from a year before. Housing costs also make up for a\u00a0growing share of the overall inflation rate:\u00a025% of August\u2019s rate, up from roughly 20% in February. And while rents and mortgage rates remain high,homebuilder sentiment, construction andhome purchasesremain\u00a0low. Thirty-year mortgage ratespassed6% for the first time since 2008 last week, and building permit applications\u00a0in August fell 10% from July and\u00a014.4% from last year.Sources across the\u00a0spectrumcover ongoing housing market issuesand how they connect to high inflation. Reports from left to right highlighted how rising housing costs made up a significant part of August's inflation report. Some voices, such as the writers of one Insider article, focused on how it \"seems unlikely that Congress will step in anytime soon to provide housing relief for Americans.\" Coverage from right-rated sources often focused more\u00a0on comparing current costs with prior years to illustrate inflation's intensity, and on voices wholabelthe current housing crisis a market recession.",
