Mamdani issued aresponse claiming, \u201cHis statements don\u2019t just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: if you speak up, they will come for you.\u201dFor Context:Mamdani, 33, won New York City\u2019sDemocratic mayoral primarylast week, defeating former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
