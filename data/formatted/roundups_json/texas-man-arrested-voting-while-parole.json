    "summary": "Hervis Rogers, a Texas man who went viral on social media after standing in line for more than six hours to\u00a0vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, was arrested on two counts of illegal voting charges after casting a ballot while on parole.\u00a0It is illegal for a citizen to knowingly\u00a0vote while still under parole in Texas; the action is legal at least 20 states. Rogers' attorney,\u00a0Andre Segura, said\u00a0his client did not know he was ineligible to vote.\u00a0Rogers, 62,\u00a0was arrested in 1995\u00a0for burglary and intent to commit theft. His\u00a0parole expired on\u00a0June 13, 2020, and now faces prison time with these new charges.Many right-rated outlets emphasized that Rogers is a twice-convicted felon and\u00a0linked the situation to\u00a0the\u00a0Republican-backed \"voting integrity bill\" that was halted by Democrats\u00a0in May.\u00a0Left-rated outlets featured quotes that sided more with\u00a0Rogers and criticized the Republican's\u00a0\"voter suppression bill.\" Most center-rated outlets listed the facts pertaining to\u00a0Rogers' arrest and his background before revealing opinions from sources.",
