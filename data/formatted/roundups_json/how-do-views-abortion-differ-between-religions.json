    "summary": "The U.S. is home to many religious\u00a0communities. How do they differ when it comes to views on abortion?DatafromPew Research Center (Center bias)shows vastly different beliefs on abortions between religions in the U.S. Eighty-three percent of people who practice Judaism say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, along with 82% of Buddhists and 68% of Hindus. Among Muslims (55%), Orthodox Christians (53%), historically black Protestants (52%) and Catholics (48%), people are more divided. Support for abortion access in all or most cases is much lower among Evangelical Protestants (33%), Mormons (27%) and Jehovah's Witnesses (18%). For some religious people, including many Christians,\u00a0life begins at conception. For others, such as many Jewish people, it begins at birth.Many sources across the political spectrum have covered theRoe v WadeSupreme Court\u00a0leakin the context of religion and faith. News coverage from right-rated outlets often framed\u00a0the possibility ofRoebeing overturned as a win for Christians, and paintedpro-choice\u00a0protests at Catholic churchesas attempts to suppress religious freedom. Many on the right also highlighted protests at the homes of Supreme Court justices anda Molotov cocktail\u00a0incident at the office of a pro-life group\u00a0in Wisconsinas evidence that Christians were under attack for their pro-life stances. Conversely, some reports from the left highlighted religions in which abortion access is widely promoted and supported, and framed abortion opponents as a religious minority.",
