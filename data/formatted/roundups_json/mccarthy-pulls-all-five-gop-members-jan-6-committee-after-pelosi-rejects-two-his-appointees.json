    "summary": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five Republican members from the January 6 select committee\u00a0after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of McCarthy's Republican appointees. Pelosi declined to accept\u00a0Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana based on\u00a0\"statements and actions\" made by the representatives, citing concern for \"the integrity of the investigation.\" Both Jordan and Banks voted against certifying the 2020 election.McCarthy saidPelosi's decision was an\u00a0\"egregious abuse of power,\" and that unless Pelosi seats all five of his Republican nominees, \"Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts.\"\u00a0Rep. Liz Cheney, who was appointed by Pelosi, remains the only Republican on the committee as of Wednesday.\u00a0The committee is expected to hold its first hearing next week.The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Some on the right criticized Pelosi's decision as a partisan choice. Some on the left pointed out that the agreed-upon structure of the committee gave Pelosi power to veto McCarthy's selections.Editor's Note: The original headline incorrectly referred to the House select committee as a \"commission.\" The commission was blocked by Senate Republicans.",
