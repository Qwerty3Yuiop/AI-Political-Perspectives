    "summary": "A\u00a0witness in the case to dismiss Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis from prosecuting Donald Trump's election interference case\u00a0said Tuesday that comments he made about Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade's relationship were \"speculation.\"The Details:In previous text messages, a former friend of Wade and attorney Terrance Bradley said he \"absolutely\" believed Willis and Wade began dating in 2019. On Tuesday in court, he said he had \"no direct knowledge\" of when their relationship began.\u00a0Willis and Wade testified that\u00a0they didn\u2019t start dating until 2022, months after Willis hired him\u00a0as special prosecutor for the Trump case.For Context:Lawyers for Trump say Willis and Wade had an improper affair and lied about when their relationship began, and should be disqualified from the case.\u00a0If Willis is removed,\u00a0a nonpartisan council\u00a0would need to appoint a new attorney to the case. The new attorney\u00a0could continue prosecuting Trump or drop the charges.How the Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum framed Willis's story as questionable, while also suggesting Bradley's testimony irked defense attorneys.The Washington Post (Lean Left bias)said Bradley's testimony was\u00a0\"frustrating\" for \"attorneys who had claimed his testimony would 'refute'\u00a0claims by Willis and Wade.\"The Washington Times (Lean Right)said Bradley \"attempted Tuesday to walk back his incriminating timeline\" of the relationship and highlighted how defense attorneys \"accused Mr. Bradley of changing his story and clamming up on the stand to protect\" Willis and Wade.",
