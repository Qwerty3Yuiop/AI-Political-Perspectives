    "summary": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) called for the United States of America to disunite in what she labeled a \u201cnational divorce\u201d on Monday, garnering criticism across the aisle.Key Quote:Greenestated on Twitter, \u201cWe need a national divorce. We need to separate by red states and blue states and shrink the federal government. Everyone I talk to says this. From the sick and disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the Democrat\u2019s traitorous America Last policies, we are done.\u201d The statement was rebuked by Democrats and Republicans alike, with Utah Governor Spencer Cox (R)calling the comment\u201cdestructive and wrong and\u2014honestly\u2014evil,\u201d and determining that \u201cwe need elected leaders that don\u2019t profit by tearing us apart.\u201dDetails:Greene did not specify which camp her state of Georgia, which has exclusively Democratic senators, five Democratic congress members, and was won by Joe Biden (D) in the 2020 presidential election, would fall into in the proposed divorce. This is not the first time Greene has promoted the idea of a \u2018national divorce.\u2019 She called for a splitback in 2021in protest of Americans migrating from \u2018blue states\u2019 to \u2018red states.\u2019How The Media Covered It:Greene\u2019s comments were covered mildly across the spectrum, with most coverage highlighting criticism of Greene. Left-rated outlets were more likely to note that Greene is on the Homeland Security Committee and has recently developed a close relationship with House Speaker Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who stated he would \u201c\u200b\u200balways take care of [Greene].\u201d",
