The affidavit appears to be fabricated.The Details:The\u00a0 screenshots originated from an AI-generated website, according toMediaite (Lean Left bias). The X account\u00a0@DocNetyoutube was the first toshare the screenshots, citing an anonymous source. The story was then shared by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Sen. Ted Cruz, Libs of TikTok, commentator Benny Johnson, andothers. Originally, Taylor Greeneclaimedthe whistleblower had died in a car accident\u00a0before walking back the statement.The Allegations:The apparently fake affidavit alleged that the Harris campaign received accommodations during the ABC presidential debate, including sample questions, fact-checking former President Trump as much as possible, restricting the scope of questions asked to Harris, a favorable split-screen view, and a smaller podium compared to Trump. ABC Newsexplicitly deniedthat Harris had been given questions ahead of time.How the Media Covered It:Sources on the right largely ignored the story or, in the case ofThe Gateway Pundit (Right bias)andAmerican Thinker (Right bias),framedthe storyas\u00a0allegedly true. Sources in the center and on the left\u00a0framed it as an instance of \"MAGA\" spreading \"unfounded rumors.\"The\u00a0Daily Mail (Right bias)also called it false,saying,\"Former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0and his MAGA allies have stoked conspiracy theories that Harris had a leg up in the debate.\"",
