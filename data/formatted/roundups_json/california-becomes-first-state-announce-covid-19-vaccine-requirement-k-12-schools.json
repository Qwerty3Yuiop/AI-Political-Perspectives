    "summary": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday that the state would require COVID-19 vaccination\u00a0for school children, becoming the first U.S. state to do so. \u201cThe state already requires that students are vaccinated against viruses that cause measles, mumps, and rubella \u2013 there\u2019s no reason why we wouldn\u2019t do the same for COVID-19,\u201d Newsom said. The new vaccine mandate is limited to in-person learning recipients and will begin with the first full school year after the FDA fully authorizes a COVID-19 vaccinefor children. The mandate will initially be limited to children 12 and up in grades 7-12\u00a0and will later be extended to those entering kindergarten.Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Friday evening, with most outlets framing the policy as the first \u201cvaccine mandate\u201d for U.S. school children. Headlines in right-rated outlets were more likely to attribute the mandate directly to Gavin Newsom.",
