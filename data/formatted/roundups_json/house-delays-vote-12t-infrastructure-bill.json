    "headline": "House Delays Vote 12t Infrastructure Bill",
    "summary": "A House of Representatives vote on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill was postponed Thursday night, as lawmakers continue to negotiate terms of\u00a0President Joe Biden's larger $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package. Progressive Democrats have withheld support for the infrastructure bill unless\u00a0Congress takes up the\u00a0reconciliation bill, which covers \"human infrastructure\" and aims to bolster the country's social safety net. Some Centrist Democrats have opposed that bill's pricetag, andrefuse to support it unless the price is reduced.The infrastructure vote was initially planned for Thursday but was delayed due to a lack of support from Democrats. Government funding for surface transportation programs ran out on Thursday, making an agreement on\u00a0infrastructure funds vital. The House is scheduled to leave Washington D.C. for a two-week break\u00a0at the end of this week.Coverage was similar and prominent across the spectrum. Many reports framed a quick agreement on the bill as unlikely and focused on the feud between the Democratic party's centrist and progressive wings. Some coverage\u00a0also suggested that Biden's agenda is in jeopardy if the bill isn't passed and Democrats remain divided.",
