    "summary": "A proposed oil drilling project in Alaska has united politicians while isolating environmentalists.The Details:The Willow project is a $6 billion proposal from ConocoPhillips to drill oil in\u00a0the 23-million acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.\u00a0The area holds an estimated 600 million barrels of oil, more than the current level in the\u00a0U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which isaround a 40-year low. President Joe Biden will soon decide on approving the project; if he did, it\u00a0would break a campaign promise to end new oil drilling projects on public land.In Favor:Many state leaders support the project, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski (D),Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R),Rep. Mary Peltola (D),\u00a0and Alaska Native leaders and mayors of communities near the planned site.\u00a0They acknowledge climate concerns\u00a0but argue that the financial benefits will outweigh\u00a0the negatives, and that the U.S. needs to reduce foreign oil dependence.Against:Other local leaders raise concerns for communities closest to the site, with one calling it \"ground zero for the industrialization of the Arctic.\" Activists arealso worriedabout impacts on native species and ecosystems, and millions have sent letters orsigned online petitionscalling to stop the project.How the Media Covered It:Center- and right-rated sources, as well as local sources like the Anchorage Daily News, focus\u00a0more on support for the project. Some left-rated outlets focused more on opposition, and framed the project\u00a0as a blow to climate protection efforts.",
