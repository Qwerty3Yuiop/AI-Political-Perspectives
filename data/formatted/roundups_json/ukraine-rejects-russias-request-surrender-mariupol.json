    "summary": "On Monday, Ukrainian officials unapologetically rejected a Russian demand that their forces surrender\u00a0in the besieged port city of Mariupol, in exchange for safe passage out.The refusal\u00a0came even before Russia's deadline of 5:00am Moscow time for a response. An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol had already stated\u00a0that Russia\u2019s promises regarding humanitarian corridors could not be trusted, and\u00a0promised that Ukraine\u00a0would defend\u00a0the city against Russian invaders. The city has beensurrounded by Russian troopsover the past few weeks, and many of its 400,000 residents are reportedly trapped with little to no food, water, or\u00a0power.\u00a0 Russia is determined to seize Mariupol as its first strategic victory in a war that appears to beapproaching\u00a0a stalematein other parts of the country.",
