    "summary": "The Biden administration this week unveiled its plan for resetting the initial 37,000 Afghan refugees who recently arrived in the United States. Under the new Afghan Placement and Assistance (APA) Program, refugees will be resettled by state; California will receive the most (5,255), followed by Texas (4,481). At least ten other states will each resettle 1,000 more refugees. The U.S. completed its military withdrawal from Afghanistan on Aug. 31 but continues to evacuate U.S. residents and refugees alike amid the Taliban's return to power; more refugees will likely arrive and be resettled under APA. The initial resettlements will begin in several weeks after refugees undergo medical screening and immunizations at overseas military bases.Voices on all sides have expressed support for welcoming refugees.\u00a0Right-rated sources have focused more on how refugees will be vetted by immigration officials, and how the means for them\u00a0to resettle stably will be provided and funded. Some highlighted residents\u00a0of areas where refugee resettlements are planned who expressed concerns about the refugees and the vetting process.",
