    "headline": "Nbc Fires Megyn Kelly After Blackface Comments Mob Mentality Missed Opportunity Or Right Move",
    "summary": "Perspectives vary across the aisle on Megyn Kelly's departure from NBC over her comments on blackface. Some say that her termination is an example of a social media mob mentality, while others write that the remarks provided a missed opportunity to engage in an honest conversation about the offensive nature of the practice, particularly when considering a 2015 poll that found the majority of white Americans believe it is appropriate for a white individual to don blackface on Halloween. Alternatively, some argue that her statements were proof positive that she is a racist, especially in light of controversial comments she made while still employed by Fox News.",
