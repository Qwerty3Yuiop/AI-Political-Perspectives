    "headline": "Biden Offers 1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill Funded Corporate Tax Hike 15 Tax Minimum",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden offered to lower his infrastructure deal to $1 trillion\u00a0in an attempt to reach a bipartisan compromise on Thursday,the Washington Post reported. In the\u00a0meeting with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W. Va.), Biden also proposed a 15% minimum tax on corporations, as well as possible revenues from increased IRS enforcement. The new proposal by Biden is significantly lower than\u00a0his initial $2.3 trillion proposal; however, it is still higher than the Republican $928 billion counteroffer that would draw much of the money from unspent funds originally set aside for\u00a0coronavirus relief legislation and $257 billion in new spending. Biden, however, is still reportedly still committed to funding the bill with a corporate tax hike, which the GOP has taken a firm stance against\u00a0as it\u00a0would undo the\u00a0party's 2017 tax cuts.\u00a0Biden is expected to meet again with Capito Friday.Coverage from across the political spectrum analyzed the likelihood of the newest proposal gaining GOP approval. Right-rated outlets tended to highlight the fact that the new proposal would still be funded with a corporate tax hike; left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the 15% tax floor.",
