    "headline": "Taliban Give First Press Conference Taking Over Afghanistan",
    "summary": "In the Taliban's first press conferencesince it took control of Afghanistan, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid described how the militant organization would run the country in accordance with\u00a0Islamic law. Mujahid pledged that women would be \"very active within our society, within our framework,\" said that \"nobody will be harmed in Afghanistan,\" promised not to launch attacks on the U.S. or other nations from Afghan soil, and said \"media should not work against national values and national unity,\"\u00a0according to translations provided by multiple media outlets. Many in Afghanistan, the U.S. and across the world remain skeptical of the Taliban's willingness to protect individual freedoms, with many recalling the behavioral restrictions and public violence against women that characterized the late-1990's\u00a0Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Since the takeover,reports have emergedof the Taliban searching homes in Afghanistan for signs of dissention or U.S. allies.Mujahid's comments made headlines across the spectrum Tuesday; the press conference was featured less prominently by right-rated outlets, while being highlighted atop the homepages of major left- and center-rated outlets includingNBC News (Lean Left bias),Associated Press (Center)andReuters (Center). Many headlines focused on the spokesman's comments about women's rights \"under Islamic law.\"",
