    "summary": "A Virginia school district is being accused of covering up allegations that a gender fluid student sexually assaulted a female student in a school bathroom in\u00a0May.The alleged victim's father, Scott Smith, says the Loudoun County School District dismissed the assault claims, and that a school counselortold he and\u00a0his wifethat \"they\u2019re not supposed to talk about anything.\" The assault suspect was reportedly arrested in July following a county sheriff's office investigation; the office says the case is \"pending court proceedings,\" and records for juvenile\u00a0cases are sealed. Smith was arrested at a school board meeting\u00a0in June and found guilty of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest; the district superintendent reportedly said during that meeting that he had \"no record of assaults occurring in our restrooms.\" The assault suspect\u00a0wasrecently chargedwith a separate assault\u00a0at a different school.Right-rated outlets have covered the story prominently following the Wire's report,\u00a0and highlighted claims about the allegations from Scott's lawyer. As of Wednesday, no left-rated outlets have\u00a0covered the news. Many right-rated voices criticized school officials, left-rated media and Democrats for purportedly ignoring the allegations to protect the transgender rights movement. Some also said Scott had been unfairly portrayed as an politically-extreme parent, and framed that narrative in the context ofthe FBI's recent move to investigate threats against school officials.",
