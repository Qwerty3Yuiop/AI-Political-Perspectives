    "headline": "Fda Warns Johnson Johnson Vaccine Linked Risk Guillain Barr Syndrome",
    "summary": "On Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning to the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine after data suggested the vaccine led to an increased risk of a disorder called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.The Washington Postreported that after 12.8 million people were inoculated, approximately 100 people developed the neurological condition, which causes the immune system to attack the nerves and sometimes has a paralyzing effect. The FDA said no data has shown a similar link between the disorder and\u00a0the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. This comes after distribution of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was paused earlier this year after a link to blood clot development in younger recipients.The story received coverage from across the spectrum.",
