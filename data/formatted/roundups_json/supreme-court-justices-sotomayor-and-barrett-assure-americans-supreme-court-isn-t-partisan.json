The appearance was an installment of Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox's\u00a0\u201cDisagree Better\u201d initiative.For Context:The court will soon hear cases that could dramatically affect the 2024 presidential race. Possible consequences of cases could include whether states have the power to remove former President Donald Trump from the ballot, or if he can be legally seen as conspiring to upend the results of the 2020 election.Key Quotes:Sotomayor said, \u201cThankfully, for us, presidents don\u2019t last that long, right? There\u2019s eight years. So for us to be beholden to one of them is a little crazy, you know?\u201d Barrett added, \u201cNot just beholden to a president, but not to a political party, either. Life tenure does insulate us from politics\u2026 We all wear the same color black robe. We don\u2019t have red robes and blue robes.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:Politico (Lean Left bias)mentioned expected rulings involving Trump and 2022 comments from conservative Justice Clarence Thomas who said the court\u2019s climate had deteriorated in recent years.The Hill (Center bias)andWashington Examiner (Lean Right bias)did not mention any of the above and simply chronicled Friday\u2019s conversation.",
