    "headline": "Should Us Let Poland Send Fighter Jets Ukraine",
    "summary": "After initially indicating support for a transfer of fighter jets to Ukraine, the U.S. now says the move is not tenable. Why?On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Poland's plan to send fighter jets to Ukraine to help against the Russian invasion\"gets a green light\" from the U.S., and suggested that the U.S. could \"backfill the planes that they\u2019re handing over to the Ukrainians\" with U.S. warplanes. The deal seemed likely to go through by mid-week, as Polandannounced a dealon Tuesday. But later on Tuesday, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said \"we do not believe Poland\u2019s proposal is a tenable one,\"\u00a0citing a lack of \"substantive rationale.\"\u00a0Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly\u00a0Russian-designed MiG jets and are unfamiliar with U.S. fighter jets, so in theory, NATO members such as Poland could sell or lend their\u00a0MiGs\u00a0to Ukraine, and the U.S. could send its F-15 or F-22 fighter jets to those countries to backfill their aerial arsenal.Some voices, especially on the political right, werecritical of the decisionand argued that Biden and NATO may have given into fears of Russian backlash against the move. Other voices said sending the jets would have risked too much escalation between the U.S. and Russia, and argued that Ukraine and allies should focus more on\u00a0antitank and antiaircraft weapons that have already proven successful in slowing Russian advances.",
