    "summary": "Roughly 200 people, including dozens of Americans, departed the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan on a Qatar Airways flight Thursday. It's\u00a0the first evacuation flight of U.S. citizens from the country since the last U.S. troops left at the end of August.\u00a0More evacuation flights with similar numbers of Americans may depart in the coming days; the exact number of Americans on Thursday's flight is unclear. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the Taliban had been preventing private charter flights from leaving Kabul due to purported issues with passengers' documentation. Qatari officials have\u00a0reportedly been working with the Taliban to help restore normal operations at Kabul's airport.The planned departure made headlines across the spectrum. Some left- and center-rated sources focused on the passengers and their nationalities more generally; some right-rated sources placed more emphasis on the Americans who were making the flight.",
