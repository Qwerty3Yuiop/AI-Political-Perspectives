In June, Kennedyfired all 17 membersof the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices and replaced them with his own appointees. The HHS said, \u201cSecretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine \u2014 he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:TheInvestor's Business Daily (Lean Right bias)mentioned other accusations in the lawsuit including blocking communications between the CDC and cancelling meetings.Politico (Lean Left)provided background on COVID-19 vaccine data and noted that the scientists who collected the data said Kennedy had misinterpreted results.Reuters (Center)wrote that for decades Kennedy \u201chas sown doubt about the safety of vaccines contrary to evidence and research by scientists.\u201d\u00a0Several outlets also omitted the HHS from their headlines, even though it was also named in the lawsuit.Revised by the AllSides staff (of humans) after a first draft from our custom AI.Learn more.Support our mission.",
