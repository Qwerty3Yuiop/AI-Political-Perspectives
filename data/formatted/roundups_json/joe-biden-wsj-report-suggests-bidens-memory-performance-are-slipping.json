I'd go to his house. He's not the same person.\"Pushback:White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said it's \"a little surprising that The Wall Street Journal thought it was breaking news when congressional Republicans told them the same false claims they've spouted on Fox News for years.\" Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA)saidshe told the Journal that Biden \"was absolutely engaged & ran that [Ukraine] meeting in a way that brought everyone together.\"How the Media Covered It:Some left-rated sources focused more on criticisms of the report from the White House and Democrats.NBC News (Lean Left)saidthe Journal \"relies on Kevin McCarthy to criticize Biden.\" Right-rated sources focused more on the details of the Journal's report.",
