    "summary": "The world will likely fail to limitglobal warmingto 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels withoutrapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, scientists said in a United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)report.Key Quotes:The report said global temperatures had already reached 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, leading to \u201cwidespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\u201d While some of these changes may be \u201cunavoidable and/or irreversible,\u201d the report said, they \u201ccan be limited by deep, rapid and sustained global greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\u201d An IPCCpress releaseadded,\u00a0\u201cEvery increment of warming results in rapidly escalating hazards,\u201d includingheat waves,droughts,food insecurity, and moreintense rainfall.For Context:This is the IPCC\u2019s sixth Assessment Report combining its findings; thefifthreport was released in 2014. It was produced by \u201chundreds of leading experts in the different areas\u201d who volunteered their time, the IPCCsaid, in a process overseen by IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. The 1.5-degree benchmark was a focus of the2015 Paris Climate Agreement, in which countries committed to a goal of keeping warming below 2 degrees.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was less common in right-rated news sources, some of which framed the report as \u201cdoomsday rhetoric\u201d that \u201coften draws skepticism from critics over the urgency of the problem.\u201d\u00a0Meanwhile, coverage in left-rated sources frequently reflected the report\u2019s dire framing, using phrases like \u201ccatastrophic warming\u201d and highlighting a quote from U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who said, \u201cThe climate time-bomb is ticking.\u201d",
