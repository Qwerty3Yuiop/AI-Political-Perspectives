    "summary": "Fox News, NBC, and Facebook have all pulled President Trump's controversial midterms immigration advertisement, prompting some to accuse left-leaning media organizations of bias. CNN declined to sell airtime for the ad as it was deemed too racist, but some have also criticized the network for constantly covering it, arguing that it gave Trump free publicity and allowed him to drive the narrative away from more important issues.",
