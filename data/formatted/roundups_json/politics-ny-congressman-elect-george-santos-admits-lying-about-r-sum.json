    "summary": "Congressman-elect George Santos,\u00a0a Republican recently elected to represent New York\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, admitted to lying about key parts of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including false claims that he graduated from New York\u2019s Baruch College and had worked for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. He still intends to serve his term in the House, which has not yet begun.For Context:The admissions, made inremarksto theNew York Post (Lean Right bias)and local radio station WABC-AM (Not Rated), came after a December 19 article inThe New York Times (Lean Left bias)which said his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u201cmay be largely fiction.\u201d Citigroup and Goldman Sachs reportedly told the Times that they had no record of Santos working at their firms, and Baruch College officials could find no record of Santos graduating the year he said he did.Key Quotes:\u201cMy sins here are embellishing my resume. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Santos told the Post, adding that he wasn\u2019t a \u201ccriminal\u201d and that it was a \u201cpoor choice of words\u201d to describe his employment at a company that did business with major financial firms as if he had worked directly with the firms. \u201cWe do stupid things in life,\u201d the congressman-elect said. Meanwhile, some House Democrats were quick to call for Santos\u2019 resignation or expulsion; Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) accused him of \u201cdefrauding\u201d voters.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Tuesday. Most coverage, including in right-rated outlets, said Santos \u201cadmitted\u201d to \u201clying\u201d; even the Post called Santos a\u201cLiar\u201din a headline. Meanwhile, theDaily Beast (Left bias)accusedFox News (Right bias)\u2014 which later\u00a0covered Santos\u2019 admission \u2014 of\u201cignoring\u201dthe story following the Times article\u2019s publication.",
