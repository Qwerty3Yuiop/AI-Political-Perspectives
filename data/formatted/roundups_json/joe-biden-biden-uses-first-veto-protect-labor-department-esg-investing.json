Your plan manager should be able to protect your hard-earned savings \u2014 whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene likes it or not.\u201dFor Context:The vetoed bill made it through the Senate after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) joined Republicans in supporting the legislation. Manchin voiced his displeasure with the President after the veto was announced, stating, \u201cthis Administration continues to prioritize their radical policy agenda over the economic, energy and national security needs of our country, and it is absolutely infuriating.\u201d Having been vetoed, the bill is now sent back to congress, where it needs two-thirds approval in both the House and the Senate to overcome Biden\u2019s veto.ESG has polarized lawmakers, with many on the left supporting it, believing it to be a more holistic approach to investment, and many on the right opposing it, fearing it compromises profits in favor of \u201cwoke\u201d ideology.How The Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum noted that this was the first veto of the Biden Administration. Axios labeled Manchin and Tester as \u201cvulnerable\u201d senators. Fox News determined a two-thirds majority in both chambers of congress was \u201cunlikely.\u201d",
