    "summary": "Following thepresidential debate, many voices on the right accused moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis of bias against Donald Trump; voices on the left countered that Trump needed more fact checking than Kamala Harris. AllSides published our own two cents today.AllSides Weighs In: In ablog post, Allsides writerClare Ashcraft (Center bias)argued that moderators showed bias by fact checking Trump's statements but not Harris', despite both candidates making false claims. At least one question also showed slant against Trump, and some important topics were omitted including\u00a0theassassination attempt on Trumpand Harris' stance towardsBlack Lives Matter riotsin 2020.The Right Cries Foul:Fox News (Right)quoted\u00a0X posts from journalists from outlets includingOutkick Media (Lean Right),The Federalist (Right),NewsBusters (Right), andThe Daily Caller (Right)who criticized Muir and Davis for \"handling the debate for\" Harris and creating a \"3 on 1\" situation. Fox also quoted\u00a0liberal pundits\u00a0who praised the moderators' conduct\u00a0and one conservative pundit who was disappointed in Trump's performance.The Left Praises\u00a0Moderators:Politico (Lean Left)wrote that, after the debate ended, \"complaints started rolling in...\u00a0as if on cue,\" implying the complainers are disingenuous and trying to manipulate public perception. The article said Muir and Davis \"sought to set the candidates \u2014 and the viewing public \u2014 straight on Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations\" and noted that \"Harris\u2019 claims were less far-fetched,\" though the moderators \"confronted\" her on some policy position changes and border policies.",
