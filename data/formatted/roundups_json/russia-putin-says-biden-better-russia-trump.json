    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said the \u201cmore experienced\u201d President Joe Biden would be better for Russia than former President Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s likely 2024 presidential nominee.The Details:In an interview with state-owned Russian TV channel Rossiya 1, Putin said he found Biden \u201cpredictable,\u201d while emphasizing that Russia would work with \u201cany U.S. leader whom the American people have confidence in.\u201d This indirect endorsement from an American adversary sparked reactions from Trump, who labeled it a \u201cgreat compliment\u201d and cited his prior sanctioning of\u00a0the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as a reason for Putin's opposition.For Context:Trump has previously received criticism for his purportedly cozy relationship with Putin; along with allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Trump famously revealed highly classified information to Russia\u2019s foreign minister and ambassador early on in his presidency.
