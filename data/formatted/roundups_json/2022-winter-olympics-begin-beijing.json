    "summary": "The 2022 Winter Olympics began Friday in Beijing, China amid continued COVID-19 concerns and cross-spectrum criticism of the Chinese government.The Games\u00a0will run from Feb. 4 to Feb. 20. Global political tensions and COVID-19 restrictions dominated the build-up to the Games, as several countries imposed diplomatic boycotts in protest of China'salleged abuse and oppression of the Uighur Muslim minorityin the country's Xinjiang region. The U.S. is among thosestaging a diplomatic boycott of the Games, but American athletes are still competing. Ticket sales to the general public were canceled last month, making it the second consecutive Olympics\u00a0to be closed to the public.Coverage from left- and center-rated sources often highlighted\u00a0efforts to prevent COVID-19 from impacting events, as well as the events themselves and the results. Right-rated outlets covered the Olympics less prominently; some highlighted how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told athletes to avoid \"incurring the anger of the Chinese government\" with protests. Many right-rated voices, especially those atNational Review (Right bias), were highly critical ofChina's record on human rights and role in the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the abuse of Uighurs and alleged cover-up of a lab leak that led to the COVID-19 pandemic; they typically urged people not to watch the Olympics this year and avoid buying into purported Chinese propaganda. One guest writer forNew York Times Opinion (Left bias)said the Games are\"already a win for Beijing\"and will highlight\u00a0\"the party-state\u2019s firm control.\"",
