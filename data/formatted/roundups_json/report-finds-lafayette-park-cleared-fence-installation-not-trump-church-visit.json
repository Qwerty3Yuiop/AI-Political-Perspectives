After the report's release,Trump thanked the inspector general in a statement\u201cfor completely and totally exonerating me in the clearing of Lafayette Park!\u201dSome coverage from the left and center highlighted the fact that some D.C. officers and BOP officers used chemical agents to clear the area.
