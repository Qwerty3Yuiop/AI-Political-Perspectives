    "summary": "Democratic lawmakers are acting to raise taxes on businesses and top earners, while\u00a0also attempting to pass theBiden administration's\u00a0$3.5 trillion spending planthrough Congress and into law. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committeerecently proposedseveral key tax changes:\u00a0raising the corporate tax rate for large companies from 21% to 26.5%; raising the top capital gains tax rate from 25% to 20%; and\u00a0raising the top individual income rate from 37%\u00a0to 39.6%. Meanwhile, Democrats say thepandemic-era Child Tax Creditwill help to reduce tax burdens for the lower- and middle-class. Many Republican lawmakers have criticized the proposal,\u00a0saying it could worsen inflation and unemployment.Coverage from left-rated outlets often concentrated on how the tax hikes could help lower-income people; some also highlighted pushback from moderate Democrats that could prevent the tax proposals from becoming law. Reports from right-rated sources usually framed the proposals in a negative light, and focused\u00a0on purportedly wasteful parts of the Democrats'\u00a0spending plan. Some right-rated voices accused the tax plan of harming small businesses; others argued that it\u00a0stillwouldn't be enough to cover the trillions of dollars\u00a0spent during the pandemicand slated for future spending by Democrats.",
