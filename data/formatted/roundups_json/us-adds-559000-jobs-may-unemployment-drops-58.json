According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were notable jobs gains\u00a0\"in leisure and hospitality, in public and private education, and in health care and social assistance in May.\"Outlets across the political spectrum covered the jobs report Friday morning. Most highlighted the fact that hiring fell short of expectations for the second straight month, but is still increasing as vaccination rates rise and public health restrictions are eased.
