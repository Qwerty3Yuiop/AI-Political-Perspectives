    "summary": "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is accusing his party's national committee of\u00a0trying to police the views of lawmakers.McConnell criticized the Republican National Committee's move toformally censure Reps.\u00a0Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.)\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.)for their participation in the\u00a0House committee\u00a0investigating the Jan. 6th Capitol riot. He said that \"singling out members of our party who may have different views from the majority\" is not the committee's job and that it traditionally serves to \"support all members of our party, regardless of their positions on some issues.\" He\u00a0also called the Capitol riot a \"violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election from one administration to the next.\"Outlets across the spectrum, especially left- and center-rated sources, highlighted McConnell's remarks. Many headlines featured his characterization of the Capitol riot as a \"violent insurrection,\" a common phrase\u00a0used on the left to describe the events of Jan. 6 but one that the right typically disagrees with.",
