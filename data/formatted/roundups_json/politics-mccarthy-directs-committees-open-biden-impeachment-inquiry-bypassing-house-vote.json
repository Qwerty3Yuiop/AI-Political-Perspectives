    "summary": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) directed three Republican-controlled House committees to begin a formal impeachment inquiry\u00a0against President Joe Biden on Tuesday oversuspected involvement in his son\u2019s business dealings.The Details:The inquiry will be led by Reps. James Comer (R-KY), Jim Jordan (R-OH), and Jason Smith (R-MO). \u201cThis logical next step will give our committees the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public,\u201d McCarthy said.For Context:McCarthy is widely reported to be under pressure from some right-wing House Republicans, who have threatened to block government funding and remove McCarthy as speaker unless their demands, including an impeachment investigation, are met.To Vote or Not to Vote:McCarthy\u2019s decision is a reversal of his September 1 assertion that a Biden impeachment inquiry would require a House floor vote. However, some Republicans oppose the inquiry, making it unclear whether a vote would pass. McCarthy was previously an outspoken critic of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) decision to open the first impeachment inquiry into former President Donald Trump without a floor vote; the House later authorized that\u00a0inquiry in a 232-196 vote.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was common across the news media. Some headlines in left-rated outlets contextualized McCarthy as \u201cunder threat\u201d from the right or gambling for conservative votes. While some coverage from the right focused on the \u201callegations,\u201d some coverage from the left directly noted a \u201clack of evidence implicating the president.\u201d",
