    "summary": "Louisiana became the first state to require public school classrooms to display the Christian Ten Commandments, likely setting up a legal battle surrounding the separation of church and state.Details:The bill requires the commandments be displayed in \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d in classrooms ranging from kindergarten to state-universities. The bill describes the commandments as historically significant and \u201cfoundational documents of our state and national government.\u201d The displayed commandments will be accompanied by a statement describing that the commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\u201d The law will go into effect in 2025. The displays will be funded by donations, not state funds.Key Quotes:Expected a legal battle to ensue, Gov. Jeff Landry stated, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to be sued.\u201d He also stated, \u201cIf you want to respect the rule of law, you\u2019ve got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Southern Poverty Law Center released a statement opposing the legislation, arguing it \u201cviolates students\u2019 and families\u2019 fundamental right to religious freedom.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:While most outlets reported simply that the bill became law because Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry (R) signed it, theAssociated Press (Lean Left bias)reported it as being slightly more complicated, stating that \u201cthe bill did not receive final approval from Landry,\u201d but \u201cthe time for gubernatorial action \u2014 to sign or veto the bill \u2014 has lapsed.\u201d",
