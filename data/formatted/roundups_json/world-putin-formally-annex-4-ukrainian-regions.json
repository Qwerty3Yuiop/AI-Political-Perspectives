    "summary": "On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin willformally annex the 4 Ukrainian regionsof\u00a0Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson from Ukraine.\u00a0In an announcement made on Thursday, the Kremlin stated that Putin would\u00a0sign\"accession treaties\"at the Grand Kremlin Palace that day, though Russia does not fully control these regions politically or militarily. After five days of voting, however, Moscow-installed regional officials are claiming amonumental\u00a0show of supportfor this seizure of Ukrainian property, while Ukraine and the West arecondemning the \"sham\" referendum.This move comes indefiance of stern international warnings, including from the United States, and couldclose the door on diplomacyfor a number of years. It will certainly escalate the war in Ukraine, with Kyiv insisting it will continue to fight to reclaim its territories, and Western allies\u00a0promising additional economic assistance and more weapons. Putin has alreadyraised fears of a long conflict with NATO, with the sabotage this week oftwo Nord Stream\u00a0natural gas pipelinesin the\u00a0Baltic Sea, hisintention to deploy300,000 additional troops\u00a0to Ukraine, and histhreat of the use of nuclear weaponsto defend Ukrainian\u00a0territories absorbed into\u00a0Russia.Sources from across the political spectrum are covering the latest moves by Russia.",
