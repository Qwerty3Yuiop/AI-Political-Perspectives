    "summary": "The latest \"Twitter Files,\" published by journalist David Zweig, moves to detail Twitter's approach to censoring certain information and viewpoints, particularly\u00a0about COVID-19.The Details:Throughapparent screenshots of internal Twitter communications, the release seems to indicate that both the Biden and Trump administrations pressured Twitter to censor certain information. Specifically, screenshots appear to show how former FBI and Twitter lawyer Jim Baker moved to have a tweet from President Donald Trump telling Americans \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Covid\u201d labeled\u00a0as misinformation; how the Trump administration urged Twitter to \"combat misinformation\"\u00a0about \"runs on grocery stores\";\u00a0and how\u00a0\"the Biden team\" pushed for action against people who voiced skepticism about COVID-19 vaccines for young people, including epidemiologistMartin Kuldorffand journalistAlex Berenson.For Context:This is the tenth installment of the Twitter Files, an effort by Twitter CEO Elon Musk to publish internal conversations about Twitter's controversial content moderation decisions.How the Media Covered It:The latest \"Twitter Files\" was a top story from right-rated sources, which continue to frame it as\u00a0damning evidence of a conspiracy by the government, media companies and tech companies to suppress conservative or dissenting viewpoints. No left- or center-rated sources covered the story as of Monday evening, and very few have covered the Twitter Files at all.Key Quotes:Zweig said the release showed how Twitter\u00a0\"seemed to promote content that reinforced the establishment narrative, and to suppress views and even scientific evidence that ran to the contrary.\"",
