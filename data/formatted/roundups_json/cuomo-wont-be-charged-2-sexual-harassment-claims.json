    "summary": "A prosecutor announced Tuesday that former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will not face criminal charges in connection with two of the sexual harassment allegations against him.The top prosecutor in Westchester County, New Yorksaidthat their investigation \"found credible evidence\" that both incidents occurred and that Cuomo's conduct was concerning, but also that their office\u00a0couldn't \"pursue criminal charges due to the statutory requirements\" of New York criminal law. The federal government and\u00a0two other county district attorneys are still probing sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo, who was also\u00a0charged with misdemeanor forcible touching in Albany County afteran executive assistant said\u00a0he groped herwhile she was working at the Executive Mansion.The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reportedearlier this month that nearly four in 10 forcible touching cases are dismissed or dropped each year in New York. Cuomoresigned as governor in Augustamid multiple harassment claims.Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight the specifics of the\u00a0allegations more prominently than left-rated sources. Some headlines from right-rated sources,such as the Daily Wire (Right bias), focused on how criminal charges wouldn't be pursued against Cuomo \"despite 'credible evidence.'\"\u00a0Bias was also evident in photo choice, with some right-rated outlets using images of Cuomo smirking ormaking strange facial expressions(Fox News, Right).\u2060",
