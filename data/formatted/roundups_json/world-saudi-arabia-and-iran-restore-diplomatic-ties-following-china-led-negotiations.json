    "summary": "Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to resume diplomatic relations following negotiations mediated by China.Details:The brokered deal comes seven years after the two nations cut formal ties. In past years, Iran-backed paramilitary groups have intervened in the ongoing civil war in Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia, targeting Saudi Arabia with missile and drone strikes. The new deal followed four days of meetings, concluding with an agreement on both sides to reopen embassies in each other\u2019s counties in the next two months, make commitments to respecting each other\u2019s sovereignty and \u201cmake every effort to strengthen regional and international peace and security,\u201d per a joint statement released.Key Quotes:National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby said, \u201cwe've always supported that process as we've seen, to work hard towards an end of the war in Yemen, and to an end to Iran's aggression, quite frankly.\u201d Kirby expressed hope the deal would succeed, but cast doubt on Iran\u2019s commitment, stating, \u201cthis is not a regime that typically does honor its word.\u201d Speaking on China\u2019s role in negotiations, Kirby said, \u201cwe certainly continue to watch China as they try to gain influence and footholds elsewhere around the world in their own selfish interest. And you're starting to see countries around the world wake up to the fact that China's influence is in their own selfish interest.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum covered the deal, all emphasizing China\u2019s involvement as an indication of its growing global influence.",
