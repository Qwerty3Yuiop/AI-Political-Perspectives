    "summary": "Politicians and the media reacted to the Senate's newly-releasedbipartisan gun safety frameworkon Monday.With an evenly divided Senate, the bipartisan deal has a better chance of\u00a0becoming law than other gun bills,including those recently passed by the House. President Joe Bidensignaledhis approval on Sunday, saying, \u201cthe sooner it comes to my desk, the sooner I can sign it.\u201d \u201cObviously, it does not do everything that I think is needed, but it reflects important steps in the right direction,\u201d Biden added.The framework was approved by a group of 20 senators \u2014 including 10 Republicans whose votes would be needed to overturn a filibuster. However, that agreement could shift as senators work out the final text of the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the framework \u201ca goodfirst step\u201d and pledged to bring the legislation to a vote \u201cas soon as possible\u201d; Minority Leader Mitch McConnellsaidthe framework showed \u201cthe value of dialogue and cooperation.\u201dOpinion coverage was relatively limited on Monday afternoon.\u00a0While voices across the spectrum were generally supportive of the bipartisan framework,\u00a0coverage from the left often\u00a0framed the deal as \u201can encouraging first step\u201d that fell\u00a0short of what was needed to stop gun violence.",
