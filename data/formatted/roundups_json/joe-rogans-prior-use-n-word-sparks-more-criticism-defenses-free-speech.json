    "summary": "Popular podcaster Joe Rogan, the content of his show\u00a0andhis $100 million contract with Spotifycontinue to drive debate about free speech, misinformation and the media business.Musician Neil Young and otherscalled for Spotify to remove their\u00a0musiclast month, with Young accusing the platform and Rogan of\u00a0spreading COVID-19 misinformation.\u00a0Then, acompilation\u00a0of Rogan using the N-wordin previous podcasts went viral.\u00a0Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told employees he\u00a0was\u00a0\"deeply sorry\"\u00a0if anyone was offended\u00a0but that\u00a0\"canceling voices is a slippery slope.\"\u00a0Seventy episodes of Rogan's show were removed from Spotify last week. Rogan apologized for using the slur but said \"he never used it to be racist because I'm not racist.\"Voices across the spectrum highlighted how Spotify \"knew what it was getting\" with\u00a0Rogan\u00a0and how his popularity and contract likely makes it hard for them to justify firing\u00a0him. Left-rated voices often highlighted examples of Rogan using the slur, purportedly spreading COVID-19 misinformation, and aligning with the far-right. One essay fromNew York Times Opinion (Left bias)criticized Rogan while also advocating for free speech andpointing to broader COVID-19 misinformation issues. Right-rated voices typically downplayed the situation and framed it as awin for free speech; some highlighted howRogan usually used the slur when quoting othersrather than using it organically. Others remained critical of Ek and Rogan for purportedly failing to adequately condemn efforts to cancel Rogan's show.",
