With no other avenues to fund the government before Thursday\u2019s deadline, Democrats were forced to omit the debt ceiling from the new temporary funding bill.Democrats were dividedon Wednesday on how to suspend the debt ceiling, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warnedseveraltimeswas necessary to avert a U.S. default in mid-October.Coverage was more prominent in D.C.-focused outlets.
