    "summary": "A federal judge\u00a0blocked Title 42 this week,\u00a0the COVID-19 pandemic-era public health policy that allowed Border Patrol to\u00a0turn away migrants with the goal of preventing the spread of COVID-19. What will this mean for the border crisis?For Context:There were230,678 encounters with migrantsalong the southwest border in October, according to Border Patrol, another all-time record and a 1.3% increase from\u00a0September.\u00a0The Department of Homeland Security\u00a0has until Dec. 21 to transition out of Title 42 and send additional resources to the border.Where People Agree:Voicesacross the political spectrum, including the editorial boards at theWashington Post (Lean Left bias)and\u00a0New York Post,agreedthat ending the policy would likely lead to another surge of migrant arrivals at the southern border, and questioned whether the government was prepared.Where People Disagree:The Washington Post's editors focused on how Congress must act on the border crisis, or else \"the nation will face the consequences of lawmakers\u2019 dithering.\"\u00a0Some right-rated writers pointed more to Biden, with the New York Post editors saying he \"refuses to do anything serious to stem the tides.\" Conversely, a\u00a0writer for MSNBC didn't mention how the policy's end may impact the border crisis, and instead called Title 42 \"xenophobic\" and celebrated its end while arguing that \"the more lax the United States has gotten with its own Covid measures, the more egregious Title 42 has looked.\"",
