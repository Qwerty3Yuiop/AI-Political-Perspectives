    "summary": "A zero-calorie sweetener popular in keto and other dietary regimens has been linked to increased risk of heart attacks and strokes by a new study from the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute published inNature Medicine.Details:The study determinedthere to be a link between consumption of erythritol, the zero-calorie sweetener, and increased susceptibility to blood clot formation. The study does not conclude erythritol to be a direct cause of heart problems, but determines that \u201cstudies assessing the long-term safety of erythritol are warranted.\u201d According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is theleading cause of death in the United States.Key Quotes:\u201cThe degree of risk was not modest,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, who was quoted in CNN\u2019s coverage. Hazen said that \u201cif your blood level of erythritol was in the top 25% compared to the bottom 25%, there was about a two-fold higher risk for heart attack and stroke. It\u2019s on par with the strongest of cardiac risk factors, like diabetes.\u201d CNN also quoted the executive director of the Calorie Control Council, who pushed back on the study, stating that it \u201cshould not be extrapolated to the general population, as the participants in the intervention were already at increased risk for cardiovascular events.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:The published study was covered consistently across the spectrum.",
