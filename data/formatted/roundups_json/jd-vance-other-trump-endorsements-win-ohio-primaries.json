His candidacy\u00a0received a late surge when formerPresident Donald Trump endorsed him; analysts across the political spectrum agreed that this race was the first major test ofTrump's influence on the 2022 midterm elections.In addition, two Trump-backed candidates won their open Republican primacy races for the House of Representatives in Ohio:\u00a0Max\u00a0Miller in the 7th District and Madison Gilbert in the 13th.\u00a0 Trump also endorsed all nine Republicans in\u00a0Ohio's House delegation seeking re-election, and they all won on Tuesday.\u00a0 Upcoming primary elections where Trump has weighed in include theSenate race in Pennsylvania, where he has endorsed celebrity doctor\u00a0Mehmet Oz, and theGeorgia Senate race, where he endorsed former football star Herschel\u00a0Walker.Vance's win was covered prominently by news sources on the left and right Wednesday. Some reports from the left highlighted Vance's past criticisms of Trump and the purported struggles of Trump-backed candidates elsewhere in the country. Some reports from the right framed the results as a positive sign for Trump and his supporters within the Republican Party ahead of the2022 midtermsand 2024 presidential election.",
