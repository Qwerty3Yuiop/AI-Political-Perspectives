    "headline": "Biden Pledges Defend Taiwan If China Were Invade",
    "summary": "At a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, President Joe Biden pledged to intervene militarily if China were to invade Taiwan. The United States has traditionally avoided making such a guarantee to Taiwan, and instead has abided by theTaiwan Relations Act, which states that the U.S. must provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\u00a0The White House is insisting that President Biden's statement is not a departure from policy, and that the U.S. will continue to acknowledge China's position that there isonly one Chinese government.\u00a0 Many in the media, however, noted the forcefulness of Biden's statements in support of self-governing.Biden also criticized China for flying their fighter jets so close to Tawin's airspace, while stating that he does not expect China to invade Taiwan. He linked his comments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying that such a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by\u00a0force - such as Russia's attack against Ukraine - should not be tolerated in Asia.",
