    "summary": "President Joe Biden's Monday remarks about inflation and gas prices were framed very differently by left- and right-rated news sources.At apress conference, Biden was asked if Americans should expect a recession amidhistorically\u00a0high inflationandrecord-breaking gas prices. Biden said U.S. economic issues are \"less consequential than the rest of the world has because of our internal growth and strength,\" and added that \"when it comes to the gas prices, we're going through an incredible transition that is taking place that, God willing, when it's over, we'll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels.\" Biden also said high gas prices\u00a0\"would be a matter of great discussion at my kitchen table when I was a kid growing up. It's affecting a lot of families.\" Theaverage price of a regular gallon of gasin the U.S. is\u00a0$4.598 as of Tuesday, an all-time high.The comments made more headlines on the right than the left. Many news outlets on the right highlighted Biden's \"incredible transition\" remark as evidence that he supports high gas prices as a way to phase out gas-powered cars, and framed that purported position as being out of touch with average Americans. Reports from left-rated outlets, such as one from CNN, framed Biden as more sympathetic to consumers, and focused more on his remarks about economic recovery and U.S. progress in electric vehicle production and viability.",
