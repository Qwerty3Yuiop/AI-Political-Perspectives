    "summary": "On Monday morning, President Joe Biden\u00a0said that deposits and the banking system are safe after thecollapse of Silicon Valley Bank.The Details:The money to SVB depositors will come from bank fees paid into theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It's\u00a0not considered a bailout because bond and stockholders wouldn't\u00a0be protected. Additionally, Biden is asking regulators and Congress to strengthen banking rules to make it less likely that this type of bank failure\u00a0could happen again.Key Quote:\u00a0\"All customers who had deposits at these banks can rest assured, rest assured they'll be protected and they'll have access to their money as of today. That includes small businesses across the country that bank there and need to make payroll, pay their bills, and stay open for business,\" Biden said.For Context: On\u00a0Sunday, federal banking regulators began efforts to prevent Silicon Valley Bank's collapse from unleashing a nationwide run on the banking system, and New York-basedSignature Bank was also shut downto contain fallout. With roughly $175.4 billion in deposits at the end of 2022, SVB's collapse has become\u00a0the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.How the Media Covered it: Sources across the political spectrum covered SVB's collapse, with many pointing out the efforts to avoid a contagion of bank failures due to any\u00a0lingering uncertainty and fear on the part of investors.",
