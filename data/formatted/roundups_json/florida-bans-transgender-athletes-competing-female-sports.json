    "summary": "Florida Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis (R) signed into law a bill prohibiting transgender women from competing in female sports at public schools and colleges on Tuesday. The Fairness in Women's Sports Act requires transgender athletes to compete on the team of the biological sex\u00a0displayed on their birth certificate.\u00a0\"We believe that is very important that the integrity of these competitions are preserved,\" DeSantis said. \"We're gonna go based on biology, not based on ideology when we're doing sports.\" Selina Soule,\u00a0a Connecticut high school track athlete who was bested by transgender athlete Terry Miller in 2019, spoke at the bill signing, saying\u00a0the experience\u00a0was \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d The Human Rights Campaign said Tuesday it plans to challenge the legislation in court.Many on the right praised DeSantis for \"protecting\"\u00a0women's sports. Many Democrats claim the bill is transphobic and discriminatory, and that signing the bill during Pride Month is \"additionally cruel\"; DeSantis said the timing was coincidental. Most outlets covered the details of the bill; some right-rated outlets covered the backlash DeSantis received from those on the left.",
