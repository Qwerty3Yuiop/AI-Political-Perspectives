    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Mondayruledthat\u00a0police officers in two cases were entitled toqualified immunity, a key issue forpolice reformadvocates. No dissent was filed in either case. In both cases, the Court argued that lower courts had improperly applied past cases as precedent for\u00a0defining\u00a0the\u00a0officers\u2019 actions as having violated \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d The first case involved an officer kneeling on the plaintiff\u2019s back for eight seconds; the other involved multiple officers lethally shooting a man after he grabbed a hammer and raised it at them.Coverage was somewhat more common in left- and center-rated outlets than right-rated outlets on Monday. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with some outlets focusing only on the case itself and others including the political context surrounding qualified immunity.",
