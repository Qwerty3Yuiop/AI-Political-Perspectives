    "summary": "Former Biden family business associate Tony Bobulinskitestified to the\u00a0House Oversight Committeeabout Joe Biden's involvement in his family's business affairs\u00a0in a closed-door hearing on Tuesday.key Quotes:\"The Biden family business was Joe Biden, period,\" Bobulinski said. \"Joe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business; he was an enabler, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\"For Context:Bobulinski, a U.S. Navy veteran,\u00a0founded\u00a0the investment firm Sinohawk Holdings with Hunter and James Biden in 2017. They then moved to enact a joint venture with private banking company CEFC China Energy. Bobulisnki and another former family business associate, Rob Walker, say Joe Biden attended several meetings regarding the CEFC deal, including one\u00a0in 2017 with CEFC's chairman.How the Media Covered It:Left-rated media often painted Bobulinski and his statements as uncredible. Some highlighted his connections to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and lawsuits Bobulinski has been involved in. Center- and right-rated media were generally less critical of Bobulinski and focused more on the specifics of his claims. Many described him as a Navy\u00a0veteran, which left-rated sources were less likely to do.Why the Difference:Especially in an election year, liberals and Democrats\u00a0are more likely to question the motivations of a source who criticizes their leader, while others might be less skeptical.",
