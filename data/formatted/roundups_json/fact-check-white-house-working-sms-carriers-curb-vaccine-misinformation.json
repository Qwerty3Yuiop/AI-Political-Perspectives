    "summary": "The White House and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) dispelled rumors that they are working with\u00a0cell phone carriers to monitor and fact-check private text messages, after aPolitico articleMonday said the Biden administration and the DNC were \"planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages.\"White House and DNC officials reportedly told the Washington ExaminerWednesday that the speculation is\u00a0false. One of the authors of the Politico article,Natasha Korecki, tweeted clarification, saying, \"it\u2019s allied, private groups that are working with SMS carriers \u2013 not the White House\", and that the groups do not have the ability\u00a0to read individual texts \"aside from the ones they receive themselves.\" The rumor comes as the White House turns to a more focused\u00a0approach to vaccinate all Americans against COVID-19 amid the spread of the Delta variant.Some outlets on the left, includingPolitico,\u00a0highlighted conservative groups who criticized the Biden administration's door-to-door vaccine efforts, and framed\u00a0those groups as \"fearmongers\"\u00a0spreading\u00a0disinformation.Some right-rated outletshighlighted other ways political officials from both parties monitor mass text messages from the other side.",
