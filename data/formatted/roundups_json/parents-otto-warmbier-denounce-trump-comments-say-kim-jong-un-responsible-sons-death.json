    "headline": "Parents Otto Warmbier Denounce Trump Comments Say Kim Jong Un Responsible Sons Death",
    "summary": "The parents of Otto Warmbier are pushing back on President Trump's assertion that Kim Jong Un was uninvolved in their son's death, saying that \"Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto\" and that \"no lavish praise can change that.\" Editors note: we change the headline from \"... say North Korea is Responsible\" to \"... say Kim Jong Un is Responsible\". Trump and the family agree that North Korea is responsible and that Kim Jong Un is responsible for the regime there. This disagreement comes from Trump saying that he believed Kim Jong Un when he said that he did not personally know about it.",
