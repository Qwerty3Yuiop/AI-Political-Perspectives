While some media highlight\u00a0the events, others focus on\u00a0China'sCOVID-19 regulations around the Games; use offake snow and potential pollution; mistreatmentof Uighur Muslims;\u00a0and thecontroversy around tennis star Peng Shuai, who disappeared after accusing a former Chinese official of sexual misconduct.\u00a0Through the first four nights, NBC was\u00a0reportedly on track for the lowest-rated Winter Games in history. Opening night\u2019s coverage\u00a0averaged 12.8 million viewers, down from the 27.8 million average at 2018's Winter Olympics.Voices across the spectrum \u2014 especially on the right \u2014 were critical of China, but often with different focuses.
