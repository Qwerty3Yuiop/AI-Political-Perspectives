    "headline": "Weekly Jobless Claims Fall Lowest Level March 2020",
    "summary": "The Labor Department (DOL)reported Thursdaythat U.S. jobless claims fell to 293,000 last week, a decrease of 36,000 from the previous week's revised level and the\u00a0lowest number of\u00a0initial jobless claims since March 2020. The number contradictsthe September jobs report, which showed the slowest job growth so far this year. According to Thursday's report, California and Michigan were the only states with over 3,000 more initial claims than the previous week. The number of new claims fell by over 1,000 in Florida, Tennessee and Texas.Coverage across the spectrum suggested that the report indicates companies are trying hard\u00a0to retain current workers. Many contrasted the seemingly positive data with recent reports indicating a more unstable economy, such as the September jobs report anda Bureau of Labor Statistics reportthat says a record number of people quit their jobs in August. Left- and right-rated outlets both quoted an economist from Navy Federal Credit Union who called Thursday's report\u00a0\"the strongest evidence yet that the Covid-19 delta wave has lost its influence on layoffs.\"",
