    "headline": "Senate Votes End Military Support Saudi War Yemen Unanimously Condemns Mohammed Bin Salman",
    "summary": "The Senate voted 56-41 to end military support for the Saudi war in Yemen and unanimously passed a resolution blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Supporters of the move say that it effectively sanctions Saudi Arabia for the actions taken against those in Yemen as well as Khashoggi and rebukes President Trump for his unwillingness to blame the regime for Khashoggi's killing. Some opponents argue that withdrawing support in Yemen will destroy the U.S.-Saudi alliance, potentially hindering efforts against Iran and further exacerbating the war.",
