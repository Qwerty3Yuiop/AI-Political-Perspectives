    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia,a Maryland resident from El Salvadorerroneously deported to El Salvador in March, alleges he was beaten, sleep-deprived, and psychologically tortured during his nearly three-month detainment in one of El Salvador's most notorious prisons.The Details:\u00a0According tocourt papersfiled by Abrego Garcia's lawyers, he was held at the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). His attorneys reported that he and 20 other deported Salvadoran men were subjected to severe conditions, including being made to kneel overnight, with guards striking anyone who fell from exhaustion. Abrego Garcia claims he lost nearly 31 pounds within his first two weeks at the prison. His lawyers have asked a federal judge in Maryland to immediately free their client from US custody.For Context:\u00a0Despite a 2019 order from a US immigration judge barring his deportation due to likely persecution by local gangs, Abrego Garcia was deported and became a focal point in President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. He was returned to the US last month to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee. His lawyers have labeled these charges as an attempt to justify his accidental deportation. The Trump administration had described his deportation as an \"administrative error.\"How The Media Covered It:The\u00a0New York Times (Lean Left bias)gave an account of the court papers and highlighted the ambiguity in the Trump administration's plans for Abrego Garcia, given the risk of him being deported again.The Washington Examiner (Lean Right)emphasized the Trump administration's role in the situation, quoting Attorney General Pam Bondi's statement that the charges against Abrego Garcia show \"what American justice looks like.\" Meanwhile,NewsNationNow (Center)focused on Abrego Garcia's allegations, providing a detailed account of the conditions he faced in the Salvadoran prison.
