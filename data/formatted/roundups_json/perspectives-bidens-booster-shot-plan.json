    "headline": "Perspectives Bidens Booster Shot Plan",
    "summary": "President Biden announced in Augustthat his administration would begin offering\u00a0a third \u201cbooster\u201d shot to Americans eight months after their second dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine starting on Sept. 20. Since the FDA has already authorized certain\u00a0immunocompromised people to get their third dose, Biden's plan prioritizes older people and health care workers. Many leading health officials have been apprehensive aboutthe White House's premature decision to weigh in on unproven COVID-19\u00a0treatments. On Thursday,the respective leaders of the FDA and CDC told White House pandemic coordinator Jeffrey Zientsthat they might only be able to approve\u00a0the vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech for \"a subset of non-immunocompromised people\" in\u00a0the next several weeks. The U.S. is still waiting for data from other countries around the world like Israel,which began promoting booster shots\u00a0for individuals 12 and older on Aug. 29.The majority of voices across the spectrum seemed to agree that the Biden administration has put pressure on the FDA to approve booster shots. Left-rated outlets, which have generally been more critical ofBiden since his\u00a0Afghanistan \"debacle,\"were more likely to take the stance that COVID-19 vaccines and subsequent boosters\u00a0provide\u00a0\"extraordinary protection\" against serious illness or death.\u00a0Some right-rated outlets highlighted howshifting the public's attention towards booster shots \"may send the wrong message about vaccines.\"",
