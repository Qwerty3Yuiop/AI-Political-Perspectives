    "summary": "Republican lawmakers in Louisiana's state Senate\u00a0Tuesday failed to overturn Gov.\u00a0John Bel Edwards' (D) veto of a bill that would have prohibited transgender students from participating in public school sports.\u00a0Edwards\u00a0rejected the bill that\u00a0would have required athletes to compete on the team of their biological sex last month.\u00a0To override a governor's veto, two-thirds of Louisiana's House and Senate must vote against it. While the\u00a0state Senate voted 26-12 along party lines to override Edwards\u2019s veto, the state House voted\u00a068-30, narrowly missing the 70-vote threshold needed to defeat it.The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum. Some coverage from right-rated sources framed the ban as justified; some reports from left-rated outlets framed it as prejudiced.",
