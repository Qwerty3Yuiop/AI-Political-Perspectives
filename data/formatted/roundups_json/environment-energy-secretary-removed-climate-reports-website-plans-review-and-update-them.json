    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s Energy Secretary Chris Wright said past versions of the National Climate Assessment (NCA) are being reviewed after the Trump administration took them off government websites.The Details:CNN reporter Kaitlan CollinsaskedWright why past climate reports were taken off government websites, to which he responded, \u201cBecause we\u2019re reviewing them and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those.\u201d He also said he \u201cwas not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports.\u201d Wright previouslypostedon X, \u201cThe ceaseless repeating from the media, politicians and activists claiming that climate change is making weather more dangerous and severe is just nonsense. That is just NOT true.\u201dFor Context:In addition to removing past reports from government websites, the Department of Energy (DOE) released a report in July suggesting that climate change is not as severe as previously thought.CNN (Lean Left bias)noted, \u201cIn stark contrast to the National Climate Assessments, which take years to research with multiple rounds of peer review, the five-person Trump report took just two months to research and write, with no peer review.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:The Hill (Center bias)included that \u201cthere is a scientific consensus that climate change is exacerbating extreme weather.\u201d CNN highlighted a coalition of scientists planning a response to the DOE\u2019s report and removal of past NCAs, saying these scientists \u201cwant to counter what they interpret as the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to wipe credible, widely accepted climate science off the record.\u201dTownhall (Right bias)published an opinion piece supporting Wright\u2019s stances, writing, \u201cUnlike President Biden, who was an avowed climate alarmist and subsidized the stupid green transition, Trump is a climate realist who advocates for American energy dominance.\u201dRevised by the AllSides staff (of humans) after a first draft from our custom AI.Learn more.Support our mission.Suggest an improvement to this summary.",
