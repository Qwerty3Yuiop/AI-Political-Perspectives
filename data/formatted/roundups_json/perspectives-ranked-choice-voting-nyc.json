    "summary": "New York City\u2019s mayoral primary election ends Tuesday and features ranked-choice voting, an electoral method that hasgained popularityin recent years. Instead of\u00a0voting for one candidate, voters rank candidates by preference. In New York, voters rank their top five among the 13 Democratic primary candidates or the two Republican primary candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of the votes, the candidate with the least first-choice votes is eliminated and their voters' second choices are counted; this process is repeated\u00a0until a candidate receives over 50% of the votes. In 2019, New Yorkers overwhelminglyvoted in favor of implementing ranked-choice votingby a 3-1 margin. Thetop five contendersin this year\u2019s Democratic primary, the winner of which is expected to win the general election, are Eric Adams, Andrew Yang, Kathryn Garcia, Scott Stringer, and Maya Wiley.Voices were relatively balanced across the spectrum, noting that the new ranked-choice system could take weeks to declare a winner and that the outcome could affect the implementation of ranked-choice voting throughout the country.",
