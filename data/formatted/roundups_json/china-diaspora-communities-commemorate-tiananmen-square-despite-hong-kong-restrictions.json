Eight people were recently arrested for alleged sedition over social media posts related to Tiananmen in the first arrests under Hong Kong's domestic national security law.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was common, although some mainstream right-rated outlets used wire service instead of original coverage. Articles in Western media across the political spectrum generally took a negative attitude towards China\u2019s repression of commemorations;The Washington Post (Lean Left bias)Editorial Board framed restrictions in Hong Kong as emblematic of \u201cChinese repression.\u201dThe Epoch Times (Lean Right bias),historically opposed to the Chinese Communist Party because of its ties to the Falun Gong movement, highlighted a quote labeling the CCP \u201cthe enemy of freedom and democracy.\u201dThis summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.",
