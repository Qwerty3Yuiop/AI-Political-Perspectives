    "summary": "President Joe Bidenon Monday announced that theDepartment of Justicehasfinalizeda new rule banning the sale of\u00a0\"ghost guns.\"Ghost guns\u00a0are un-serialized\u00a0firearms\u00a0that can be assembled at home by using parts usually sold in a kit. In an attempt to decreasegun violence, federal firearms manufacturers will now be required to add serial numbers to ghost guns. Biden called the rule\u00a0\"basic common sense\" during a speech in the Rose Garden, emphasizing that ghost guns are the\u00a0\"weapons of choice for many criminals\" and can be assembled in under 30 minutes.The White Houseestimatedthat about 20,000 \"suspected\" ghost guns were reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in 2021,\u00a0a ten-fold increase from 2016.Attorney General Merrick Garland argued in an op-ed forUSA Today (Lean Left bias)that\u00a0\"there is\u00a0no way to track\" ghost guns since they don't have serial numbers, and called the changes \"long overdue.\"\u00a0Left-rated voices are more likely to agree with Garland and celebrate the rule. Many right-rated voices see this as an abuse\u00a0of government power. OneNational Review (Right bias)writer argued that the\u00a0regulations won't\u00a0\"have much impact on violent crime\" and pointed to other methods to reduce crime like \"pro-active policing,\" while criticizing\u00a0Democrats who purportedly can't accept\u00a0\"the hard truth that blacks are offending at disproportionately high rates.\"",
