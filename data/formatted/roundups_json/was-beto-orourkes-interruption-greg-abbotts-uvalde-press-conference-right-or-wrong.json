    "summary": "A press conference following the Texas elementary school shooting this week briefly became the stage for the state's 2022 gubernatorial race.Candidate Beto O'Rourke (D) confronted Gov. Greg Abbott (R) Wednesday at a conference on the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas. O'Rourke\u00a0approached the table where Abbott was speaking, saying\u00a0\"You're offering us nothing\" and calling the shooting \"totally predictable when you choose not to do anything.\" O'Rourke's interruption lasted roughly 30 seconds before he was escorted out, and he turned around and continued for several more seconds before being removed.Abbott appeared to remain\u00a0silent during the confrontation, while Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, who was seated at the table with Abbott, stood up and began cursing at O'Rourke.Voices on either side of the partisan gun debate tended to align with their politicians. Left-rated media outlets tended to frame Abbott negatively. Coverage from Fox News (Right bias) and other right-rated sourcesoftenhighlightedvoices who criticized O'Rourke.\u00a0One column from Washington Examiner accused O'Rourke of hijacking the moment for political gain, and highlighted McLaughlin's anger with\u00a0O\u2019Rourke \"for trying to turn the shooting into a political issue.\" Another column\u00a0from Vogue supported O'Rourke's interruption and a strong gun control agenda, saying it was \"cathartic to see O\u2019Rourke express some fraction of the frustration and rage that people across the country are feeling.\"",
