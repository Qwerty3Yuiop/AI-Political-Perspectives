    "headline": "Federal Judge Blocks Enforcement Texas Heartbeat Act",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked enforcement\u00a0of Texas' heartbeat abortion law. The law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected, and allows private citizens to sue anyone who helped provide an abortion after six\u00a0weeks of pregnancy; citizens are awarded\u00a0at least $10,000 if the suit is successful.\u00a0 Part of the legal debate over the law has focused on this provision, which removes the responsibility of enforcement from the state's executive branch and places it in the hands of citizens.The action comes after the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect in a 5-4 vote on Sept. 1. Legal action will continue as the\u00a0decision in Texas will be appealed to the conservative Firth Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas.",
