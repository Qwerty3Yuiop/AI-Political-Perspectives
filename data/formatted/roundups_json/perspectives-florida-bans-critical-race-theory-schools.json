    "summary": "The Florida State Board of Education unanimously voted to ban lessons that include critical race theory (CRT) from public schools Thursday. The board approved anamendment that\u00a0prohibitsthe teaching that America is inherently racist, or\u00a0\"the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons.\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a video before the meeting that\u00a0CRT distorts history, and urged board members, many who were appointed by DeSantis himself,\u00a0to approve of the amendment that would teach student historical\u00a0facts instead of \u201ctrying to indoctrinate them with ideology.\u201d This comes after other states, such as\u00a0Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Iowa, have putrestrictions on CRT in classrooms.\u00a0Critics of the theory say that students should not be taught that the U.S. is inherently racist, while advocates of CRT argue the\u00a0U.S. was founded on stolen land and slave labor, and many of the country's\u00a0institutions still uphold racism through laws and systems that favor white people over people of color. People on both of the argument also warn that\u00a0narrowing acceptable classroom material could violate free speech.Many on the left criticized DeSantis, calling the ban's language \"vague\" and arguing that\u00a0the ban is aimed atavoiding analysis of ongoing racism. Right-rated outlets tended to focus on DeSantis' speech and the details of the amendment, and frame CRT in a negative light.",
