    "summary": "A commission formed by President Joe Biden to\u00a0study potential changes\u00a0to the Supreme Court has\u00a0raised concerns about increasing the number of justices. Preliminary draft materials released on Thursday contained warnings from some members that feared the \"partisan maneuver\" would\u00a0\u201cundermine, rather than enhance\u201d the\u00a0Supreme Court's legitimacy. The bipartisan\u00a0commission met Friday to assess\u00a0term limits for justices, limiting the number of justices that a\u00a0president can name, and whether\u00a0expanding the Supreme Court would be \"wise.\"\u00a0Progressive Democrats who have pushed to expand the number of seats\u00a0said that the\u00a0draft\u00a0\"misses the mark,\" alleging that the group is\u00a0\"biased\" against court-packing. Biden formed the 36-member commission in April in order to receive\u00a0\u201canalysis and appraisal\u201d from both sides of the current debate over the Supreme Court. He will receive a final report from the commission\u00a0in mid-November.Left-rated outlets argued that the high court's\u00a0conservative majority continues to\u00a0\"empower corporations, prevent action on climate change and roll back civil rights, voting rights and women\u2019s rights to control their own bodies.\" Right-rated voices highlighted how Democrats \"fumed\" over the initial draft and were more likely to cover howtwo conservative jurists resigned from\u00a0the commission after the\u00a0meeting on Friday.",
