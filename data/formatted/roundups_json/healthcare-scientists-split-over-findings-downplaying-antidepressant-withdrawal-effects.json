    "summary": "A new studyconductedby researchers at Imperial College and King\u2019s College London has sparked a debate among scientists over the severity of withdrawal symptoms from antidepressants.The Details:The study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, included 50 trials involving nearly 18,000 patients and suggests that most people do not experience severe withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing use of the drugs. They found that, on average, patients who discontinued antidepressants experienced about one additional symptom, most often dizziness. Experts from the University of East London (UEL) have criticized the study, arguing that it is flawed and could potentially endanger patient safety.For Context:Antidepressants areprescribedto roughly one in nine adults in the United States, according to the CDC. A 2019study claimedthat 56% of patients experienced withdrawal symptoms when they stopped taking antidepressants\u201346% of those described their symptoms as severe. Antidepressant withdrawal has been a point of contention within the medical community. In response to concerns about SSRIs, alternative forms of treatment, includingpsychedelics, have gained traction.How the Media Covered It:The Telegraph (Lean Right bias)emphasized the potential danger to patient safety posed by the study's conclusions, citing criticism from the University of East London. It also highlighted limitations to the study, including the two week review period of patients after getting off medication.The Conversation (Lean Left)published an article written by two researchers involved in the 2019 study, voicing concerns over how long-term use of antidepressents can cause severe and sometimes\u00a0debilitating\u00a0withdrawal symptoms. It also criticized the new study's reliance on short-term, industry-funded studies.The New York Times (Lean Left)focused on the new study's reassurances about withdrawal effects, but also acknowledged criticisms of its methodology. It heavily quoted one of the authors of the new research who criticized \u201cexaggerated and alarmist\u201d communication surrounding antidepressants.Revised by the AllSides staff (of humans) after a first draft from our custom AI.Learn more.Support our mission.Suggest an improvement to this summary.",
