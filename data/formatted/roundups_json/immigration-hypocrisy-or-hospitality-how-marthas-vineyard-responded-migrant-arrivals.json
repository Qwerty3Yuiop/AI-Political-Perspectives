Ron DeSantis's response to the immigration crisis at the southern border.How did the island react?Regional mediareportedon how some localsdonated food and clothes and helped set up a shelterwith beds for the migrants soon after they arrived. Videos of Vineyard residentsinteractingwith the migrants were shared thousands of times\u00a0on social media. Two days after arriving, the migrants weremoved to a military base on the mainland.Right-rated news sources and voices usually framed the sanctuary community of Martha's Vineyard ashypocriticalfor supporting open immigration policy but purportedly rejecting migrants who arrived last week. Manycitedthe\u00a0military base relocation and an apparent lack of job offers or long-term housing options\u00a0as evidence of the hypocrisy.\u00a0Conversely, left-rated mediafocused moreon reports ofwarm welcomes, and framed the right's response as inaccurate. Some, such as oneVox (Left bias)writer,cautionedthat a nice response from locals doesn't mean they support policies \"needed to support the masses of migrants\" seeking a better life in the U.S.What happens to migrantsafter they've been transferred to sanctuary cities has been a focus for sources across the spectrum.AYouGov/The Economist pollconducted this week found that44% of respondents approvedof Florida sending migrants to sanctuary cities without notice, while anequal share disapproved.",
