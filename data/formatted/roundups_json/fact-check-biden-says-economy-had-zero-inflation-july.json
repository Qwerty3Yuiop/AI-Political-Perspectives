    "headline": "Fact Check Biden Says Economy Had Zero Inflation July",
    "summary": "In response toWednesday's monthly inflation data, President Joe Bidensaidthe U.S. economyhad \"zero percent inflation\"in July.\"I want to say a word about news that came out today relative to the economy. Actually, I just want to say a number: zero,\" Biden said at the White House. \"Today we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of July.\" Biden was likely describing the monthly inflation rate. TheConsumer Price Index (CPI), a common gauge of the price of goods in the U.S.,was essentially unchanged from June to July.However, theCPI was up 8.5% in July from a year earlier, according to the same report.Many Republican lawmakerscriticized Bidenfor purportedly \"gaslighting\" and\u00a0cherrypicking data to paint the economy as healthier than it actually is. This criticism was reflected incoverage from many right-rated sources, some of whichdescribed Biden's claim as false. Several left-rated outlets andjournalistsdefended Biden's remark as accurate, and highlighted other positive aspects of the inflation report, such as how core inflation rose at its slowest pace since September 2021.",
