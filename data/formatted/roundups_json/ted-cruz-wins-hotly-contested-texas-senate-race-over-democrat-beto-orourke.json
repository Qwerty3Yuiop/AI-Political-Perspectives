    "headline": "Ted Cruz Wins Hotly Contested Texas Senate Race Over Democrat Beto Orourke",
    "summary": "GOP Sen. Ted Cruz won reelection in the Texas Senate race, beating Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke in one of the most hotly contested elections across the country. Some have cited the state's conservative values as the primary factor behind O'Rourke's loss, particularly as he raised more money than any other Senate candidate in history. Others have celebrated the campaign as a success, writing that it shows a victory for Democrats in the deep red state is not out of reach.",
