The same day, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said lawmakers \u201dshould be prepared to take quick action\u201d on a bill to extend the shutdown deadline by one week. The measure would give Congress more time to iron out the details of a full omnibus government funding bill, which Schumer said would come \u201cbefore the holidays.\u201d Meanwhile, lawmakers have reportedly decided not to considerraising the debt ceiling\u2014 which the federal government is expected to hit sometime in 2023.Key Disagreements:Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) toldNBC News (Lean Left bias)that while lawmakers \u201chaven\u2019t reached anagreement,\u201d the \u201ccircumstances are there\u201d and they \u201ccould reach one.\u201d Shelby also said the major disagreements amounted to about $26 billion of the expected $1.5 trillion bill, focused on domestic discretionary spending. While Democrats reportedly argue that this spending is fair game, Republicans insist that other Democrat-backed spending bills have already allocated enough, or too much, to domestic programs. There appears to be more agreement on defense spending, which has already passed in the House.How the Media Covered It:Coverage was common across the spectrum, often featuring language like \u201clooming.\u201d Some analysis coverage in left-rated outlets accused Republicans of trying to \u201csabotage\u201d or\u201ctorpedo\u201dnegotiations by trying to block some domestic spending.",
