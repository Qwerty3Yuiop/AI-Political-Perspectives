    "headline": "Perspectives Biden And Covid 19 Lab Leak Theory",
    "summary": "The theory that the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0began with a laboratory leak in Wuhan, China remains a subject of discussion across the spectrum, and President Joe Biden's handling of the theory remains in\u00a0the spotlight.\u00a0Bidenrecently directed intelligence agencies to probe the pandemic's genesisand to report back to him within 90 days. CNN reported this week thatBiden shut down a Trump administration effort to investigate the pandemic's originsearlier this year, citing concerns about the quality of evidence. Biden's renewed focus on COVID-19's origins reportedly came after U.S. intelligencerevealed a host of still-unexamined datapertaining to the investigation.Coverage across the spectrum analyzed what the consequences of the investigation would be for China if the theory is proven true. Right-rated media has focused more on the theory overall than left- and center-rated sources. Coverage from left-rated sources often concentrated on the new investigations, possible evidence, and evaluating the theory's likelihood. Many right-rated voices remained highly critical of Biden, public health officials and the mainstream media for purportedly ignoring the lab leak hypothesis until now, accusing them of allowing their disdain for Trump to cloud their judgment when it came to evaluating the theory; Trump was one of the narrative's early proponents.",
