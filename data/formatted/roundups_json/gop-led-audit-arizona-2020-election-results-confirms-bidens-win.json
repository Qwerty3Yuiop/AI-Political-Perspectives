    "summary": "A Republican-led audit of the 2020 presidential election results in Maricopa County, Arizona has reportedly confirmed President Joe Biden's victory.The original county vote totals showed Biden winning by 45,109 votes; the audit and hand recount reportedly found that Biden won by 45,469 votes.\u00a0The audit was spurred by former President Donald Trump's claims that voter fraud and Democratic conspiracies tilted the election in Biden's favor. Arizona's state Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a cybersecurity firm from Florida, to conduct the audit.A draft of the auditwas obtained by journalists before it was presented to the state Senate on Friday. State Sen. Wendy Rogers (R)tweeted Thursdaythat the draft \"is only a partial report\" and that\u00a0Friday's \"hearing will render findings of great consequence.\" Maricopa County is the U.S.'s 4th-most populous\u00a0county.The news was covered prominently by major left- and center-rated sources Friday. Coverage from the left and center often criticized Trump and Arizona Republicans for continuing to claim the election was rigged against him. Few right-rated outlets offered original coverage of the news; some right-rated voices acknowledged that claims of a stolen election were false, butadvocated for continued focus on voting integrity and election security.",
