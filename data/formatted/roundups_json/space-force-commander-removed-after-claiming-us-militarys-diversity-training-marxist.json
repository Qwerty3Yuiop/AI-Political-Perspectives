    "headline": "Space Force Commander Removed After Claiming Us Militarys Diversity Training Marxist",
    "summary": "A Space Force commander was reportedly relieved from his post after he criticized the U.S. military on a conservative podcast. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeier appeared on The Steve Gruber Show to discuss his new book, which claims that Marxist beliefs are becoming more common in the armed forces. On the podcast, Lohmeier said he has witnessed \u201cfundamentally incompatible and competing narratives of what America was, is and should be.\u201d  Lohmeier also said that \"the military's inclusion and equity industry and the trainings we're receiving in the military via that industry are rooted in critical race theory which is rooted in Marxism.\" A Defense Department officialsaid in a statement to CNNthat Lohmeier was relieved from his command \u201cdue to loss of trust and confidence in his ability to lead.\u201d A Department of Defense directive states that active duty service members may not participate in partisan activities, such as speaking before a partisan gathering; Lieutenant General Stephen Whiting will begin an investigation into Lohmeier's comments to see if they constitute prohibited partisan political activity.  \n\nSome coverage from the left and center tended to highlight the Defense Department's response, as well as Lohmeier's history of speaking about these issues. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight details of Lohmeier's allegations, and pushback from GOP lawmakers.",
