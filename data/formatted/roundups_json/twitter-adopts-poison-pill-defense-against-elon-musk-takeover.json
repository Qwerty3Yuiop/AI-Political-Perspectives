    "summary": "Twitter\u2019s board of directorslaunched its defense againstElon Musk\u2019s hostile takeover attempton Friday by unanimously adopting a limited duration shareholder rights plan, often called a \u201cpoison pill.\u201dThe plan stipulates that if any individual or group acquires 15% of Twitter\u2019s outstanding common stock without the board\u2019s approval, others would be allowed to purchase new shares at a discount, thereby dilutingthe newcomer\u2019s control of the company. \u201cPoison pills\u201d are a common tool for defending against hostile takeovers, and theWall Street Journal (Center bias)reportedThursday that Twitter was considering the move.Twitter is consulting with Goldman Sachs andJPMorgan Chase, according to reporting byBloomberg (Lean Left). Musk, who now owns 9.2% of Twitter, has consulted with Morgan Stanley, which reportedly owns 8%. In a Wednesday letter, Musk appeared to signal that he woulddump his Twitter stockif his takeover bid was unsuccessful.Private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which several outlets called a \u201cbuyout firm,\u201d also approached Twitter with an acquisition offer, according toReuters (Center bias).Coverage was widespread and prominently featured across the spectrum on Friday, with most headlines highlighting the phrase \u201cpoison pill.\u201d Coverage of the \u201cpoison pill\u201d plan was mostly balanced, although coverage was divided when discussing related issues like Musk\u2019s wealth and his intentions for online content moderation.",
