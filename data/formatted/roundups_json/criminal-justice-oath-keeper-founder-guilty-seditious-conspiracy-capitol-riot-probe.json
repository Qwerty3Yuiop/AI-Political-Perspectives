    "summary": "Two members of the Oath Keepers, including the group's founder, were convicted of seditious conspiracy Tuesday for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot.Key Quote:\"The Justice Department is committed to holding accountable those criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy on January 6, 2021,\"\u00a0Attorney General Merrick Garland said. \"The prosecutors and agents on this case worked tirelessly, with extraordinary skill, and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice.\"For Context:TheOath Keepersis an anti-government group that often aligns with right-wing causes. Prosecutors argued that the group's members orchestrated a violent plot to overturn President Joe Biden's 2020 victory. Testifying in his own defense, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes said there was no plan to storm the Capitol. He and another Oath Keeper, Kelly Meegs, were found guilty of seditious conspiracy, which carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence. Three other group members were acquitted of the conspiracy charge, but found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding and aiding and abetting the riot.How the Media Covered It::Left- and center-rated sources covered the conviction much more prominently than right-rated outlets did. Some, such as CNN (Left bias), focused on what the charges may mean for Trump. Some right-rated sources focused more on the acquittals, which were the first in any of the Capitol riot probes.",
