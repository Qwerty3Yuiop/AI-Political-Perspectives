    "summary": "The Senate voted 61-36 Tuesday to pass theRespect for Marriage Act, which\u00a0would provide federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriage.For Context:Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting the bill, which arose\u00a0after\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said earlier this year that the Court \"should reconsider\"\u00a0its prior decision on\u00a0same-sex marriage. The bill is a key element of theCongress's current lame-duck session, as Democrats try to push through multiple agenda items before Republicans take over the House in January.\u00a0A bipartisan amendment\u00a0to the bill was adopted Monday stating\u00a0that nonprofit religious organizations \"shall not be required to provide services\" to a marriage they\u00a0oppose. Three other suggested amendments from Republicans failed.What's Next:The bill\u00a0now heads to back to the House, where it's expected to be passed and sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said the House could vote on it as early as next week.How the Media Covered It:The bill's Senate passage was a top story from news sources across the political spectrum Tuesday evening. Right-rated outlets tended to focus more on the proposed amendments.",
