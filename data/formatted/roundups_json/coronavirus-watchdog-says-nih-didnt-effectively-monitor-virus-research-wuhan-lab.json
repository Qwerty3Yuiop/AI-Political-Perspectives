    "headline": "Coronavirus Watchdog Says Nih Didnt Effectively Monitor Virus Research Wuhan Lab",
    "summary": "Agovernment watchdog reportedthis week that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) failed to manage U.S.-funded coronavirus\u00a0research in Wuhan, China.The Details:The report says NIH andEcoHealth Alliancewere late in reporting\u00a0that lab-made coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were more infectious than natural variations. The report also said NIH didn't refer the findings to a government panel assigned to overseegain-of-functionresearch. Between 2014 and 2021, NIH gave EcoHealth Alliance $8 million in grants. Of that, $600,000 was used for Wuhan lab research.Key Quotes:Despite identifying risks associated with the research, NIH didn't \"effectively monitor or take timely action to address EcoHealth's compliance with some requirements,\" the report states.For Context:The Wuhan lab\u00a0has been thefocus of scrutiny. In April 2020, NIH told EcoHealth to stop funding\u00a0the lab over concerns of a\u00a0possible leak that could have sparked the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)sparred over the situationin 2021. Paul accused Fauci of lying about funding risky\u00a0research in China, which Fauci denied. COVID-19's origin remains unclear. A Senate GOP report in October 2022 said the virus\"most likely\"leaked from the lab.How the Media Covered It:Right-rated sources highlighted the report prominently, often framing it as\u00a0evidence that Fauci lied, and that\u00a0taxpayers helped fund risky research that could have sparked the pandemic. Left- and center-rated sources covered the news less.",
