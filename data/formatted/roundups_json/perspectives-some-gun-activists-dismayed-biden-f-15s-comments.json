    "summary": "In aspeech about gun violence and crime preventionWednesday, President Joe Bidensaid: \"Those who say the blood of lib- - 'the blood of patriots,'\u00a0you know, and all the stuff about how we're going to have to move against the government. Well, the tree of liberty is not watered with the blood of patriots. What's happened is that there have never been - if you wanted or if you think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.\" Biden continued by advocating for more gun control, saying \"there has always been the ability to limit \u2014 rationally limit \u2014 the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it.\"Many right-rated news outlets reported on the comments, and many right-rated voices reacted to them. Some voices said Biden's words were confusing or disillusioned; others took them as a threat, and a warning from Biden that the public\u00a0would be unable to fight back against a tyrannical U.S. government. Conversely, the comments received little to no coverage from left- and center-rated news sources; some\u00a0right-rated outletssubsequently\u00a0reported on that\u00a0lack of coverage. Business Insider was one of the only non right-rated sources that offered original reporting on the story; it described Biden's comments as a joke and a\u00a0mockery of \"people who think they needed guns to take on the US government.\"",
