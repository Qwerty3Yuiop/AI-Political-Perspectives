    "summary": "Arecent statement from the Treasury Departmentsaid as of Jan. 31, the U.S. had a national debt of $30\u00a0trillion.That number\u00a0equals just over $90,000 per citizen, or nearly $240,000 per taxpayer.\u00a0Debt-fueled spending increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the U.S. governmentborrowed roughly $5 trillion to fund\u00a0effortsto stave off\u00a0economic fallout from\u00a0lockdowns, restrictions, job losses, and reduced consumer spending.\u00a0America's national debt exceeded $10 trillion for the first time ever in October 2008, and reached $20 trillion in September 2017. When the 2019 fiscal year ended, the total public debt outstanding was\u00a0$22.7 trillion.Coverage across the spectrum framed the number as concerning and a reason forPresident Joe Biden's failure to advance his $1.75T Build Back Better spending plan. Reports from some left- and center-rated sources pointed out economic experts who said extra spending amid the COVID-19 pandemic was a good idea, and cited low interest rates andcontinued economic growthas reasons that high national debt might not be a bad thing. Coverage of the news from right-rated sourcesoften mentioned current high inflationand framed COVID-19 stimulus spending as excessive. One writer on the right argued that the debt is the result ofpoliticians from both parties spending the last two decades borrowing money carelessly\"to pay for everything from foreign wars to $1,200 checks for most Americans.\"",
