Officials had already begun cracking down on protesters after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the country's Emergencies Act, and reports across the spectrum highlighted howfinancial accounts of some protesters and funders of the convoy were frozen. Police also arrested 11 people after discovering a cache of weapons, including\u00a0body armor and high-capacity firearm magazines, among protesters at a US-Canada border crossing in Alberta.Reports from left- and center-rated outlets often focuses\u00a0on alleged crimes of the protesters and frames them as dangerous or disruptive.
