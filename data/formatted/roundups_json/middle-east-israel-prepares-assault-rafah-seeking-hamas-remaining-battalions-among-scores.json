    "summary": "Israel launched airstrikes targeting Hamas in the city of Rafah \u2014 on Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt \u2014 despite warnings from the Biden administration and others against hitting the densely-populated refugee destination.For Context:Previous fighting in population centers like Gaza City and Khan Younisled hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees to flee\u00a0south, often arriving in Rafah. Deaths reported by the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry reportedly neared 28,000 on Friday.The Details:The Israeli strikes hit various locations in Rafah, including two residential buildings. Israel also launched airstrikes in central Gaza, reportedly killing 22. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0ordered the Israeli Defense Forces to develop a plan to evacuate civilians in Rafah ahead of a \u201cmassive operation\u201d to eliminate Hamas\u2019 four remaining battalions in the area.How the Media Covered It:Some coverage echoed past divides in describing Gaza and Palestinians; whileCBN (Right bias)called Rafah \u201cHamas\u2019 last remaining stronghold\u201d and framed the Biden administration as standing in the way of defeating Hamas, theAssociated Press (Lean Left bias)featured quotes from refugees who had taken shelter in Rafah, noting sidewalks \u201cclogged with tents full of families\u201d and framing Israel as \u201cshrugging off its previous calls to reduce civilian casualties.\u201dThis summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.",
