    "headline": "New Us Jobless Claims Drop Pandemic Low",
    "summary": "New U.S. jobless claims fell to a pandemic low last week as applications for state unemployment benefits dropped for the\u00a0fourth consecutive week.\u00a0The Labor Department reported that initial unemployment claims fell 29,000 to 348,000 last week, and that there were 10 million job openings. This trend seems to indicate that the economy is recovering as labor market conditions improve; it also\u00a0suggests that market demand for workers is exceeding the number of Americans seeking work.The fall in claims comes despite a nationwide rise in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant.",
