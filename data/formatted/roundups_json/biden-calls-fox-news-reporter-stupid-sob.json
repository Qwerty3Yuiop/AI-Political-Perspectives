What a stupid son of a bitch.\" Later that night, Doocy said that\u00a0\"Within about an hour of that exchange, [Biden] called my cell phone and he said, 'It's nothing personal, pal'...He cleared the air, and I appreciated it. We had a nice call.\"\u00a0In the 12 months leading up to December, U.S. inflationhit the highest rate seen since 1982.Reports across the spectrum, especially from right-rated outlets, highlightedother recent examplesof Biden getting upset in response to questions from reporters.
