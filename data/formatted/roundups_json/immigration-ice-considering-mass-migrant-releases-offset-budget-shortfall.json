Many of these migrants would be released into the U.S., while others\u00a0would be deported back to their home countries,Key Quote:\u00a0\u201cThe Administration has repeatedly requested additional resources for DHS\u2019s vital missions on the southwest border and Congress has chronically underfunded them,\u201d a Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement.For Context: Last week, abipartisan Senate border billthat would have earmarked $7.6 billion for ICE, including an additional $3.2 billion for detention capacity, failed.
