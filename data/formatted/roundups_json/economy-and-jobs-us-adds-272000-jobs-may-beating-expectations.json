    "summary": "The U.S. economy added a surprisingly high 272,000 jobs in May, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)reportedFriday morning.The Details:BLS also reported a 4.0% unemployment rate for May, slightly higher than April\u2019s 3.9%, representing about 6.6 million unemployed people. The number of long-term unemployed \u2014 those jobless for 27 weeks or more \u2014 was 1.4 million. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in May to $34.91, outpacing April\u2019s 0.3% monthly inflation.For Context:Economists had expected a slowdown in job creation. Employment figures have been closely watched this year for their potential impact onthe Federal Reserve\u2019s expected future interest rate cuts,which have yet to materialize asinflation remains at an elevated 3.4%.Some havecited record immigration as a possible explanation for the current unusual mixof job growth, low unemployment, elevated inflation, andGDP growth.How the Media Covered It:Expectations for this jobs report were much lower; on Thursday,Bloomberg (Lean Left bias)predicted a\u201csteady slowdown\u201dto 180,000 new jobs, citing a survey estimate. Thus, outlets across the spectrum called the report \u201castounding\u201d and a \u201cblockbuster\u201d that \u201cburst past expectations.\u201d As with previous election year economic coverage, news outlets aligned against the current presidential administration sometimes painted a more negative picture of the economy; for instance, aFox Business (Lean Right bias)headline highlighted unemployment \u201cunexpectedly\u201d rising. Meanwhile,CNN Business (Lean Left bias)took an almost celebratory tone on \u201cthe blowout May jobs report\u201d while noting in a different\u00a0article that the report was \u201copaque\u201d about the overall state of the economy.",
