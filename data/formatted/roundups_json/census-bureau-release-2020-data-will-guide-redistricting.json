    "summary": "On Thursday, the U.S. Census Bureaureleased data from the 2020 Censusthat will guide redistricting.\u00a0 The results, which are\u00a0being released late due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will be used by states to redraw district lines for the U.S. House of Representatives based on where residents live. Democrats will control redistricting\u00a0for 75 U.S. House seats in eight states; Republicans control redistricting for 187 U.S. House seats in 20 states.\u00a0 Districts in other 16 other states will be drawn by either split state legislative chambers or independent commissions.The census figures will serve as a benchmark for things such as death rate, market research, and government-funding formulas.\u00a0 About two-thirds of Americans ended up answering the census on their own, which normally\u00a0results in more accurate and complete results.",
