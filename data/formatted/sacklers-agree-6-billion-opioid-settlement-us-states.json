    "headline": "Sacklers Agree 6 Billion Opioid Settlement Us States",
    "summary": "The Sackler family owners of Purdue Pharma agreed Thursday to pay as much as $6 billion to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits from several states.The agreement, which has yet to be approved by a bankruptcy judge, came after Purdue and several states traded appeals on a previous bankruptcy agreement involving a $4.5 billion payout. The new deal would not protect the Sacklers from future liability related to the opioid crisis. It would also allow organizations to remove the Sackler name from buildings.Coverage was widespread and mostly balanced across the spectrum on Thursday. Coverage was somewhat more common in left and center-rated outlets than right-rated outlets.",
