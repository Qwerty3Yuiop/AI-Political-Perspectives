    "headline": "World Annexation Referendums Begin Russian Occupied Ukrainian Regions",
    "summary": "In the Russian-occupied portions of Ukraine, referendums are being heldby Moscow-backed regional governments to vote on joining the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government and the bulk of Western countries have denounced the referendums as fraudulent, illegal, and conducted under undemocratic circumstances.Reports from the regions back these sentiments,with an article from CNN stating that voting on the issue is being \u201ceffectively carried out at gunpoint\u201d by Russian-backed separatists and invading Moscow forces. Results from each region\u2019s vote are expected to be announced gradually in the next week, but most outlets are already predicting the vote to overwhelmingly favor joining Russia on account of the performative nature of the referendum. The decision to hold the referendum mirrors previous strategies from the Kremlin. A similar vote was held on the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and used to justify Russian occupation of the Ukrainian land.The referendum comes as Russia works to reclaim their footingand bolster support for their invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced apartial mobilizationof the country, which resulted in protests across the country andincreased border crossingsout of Russian territory.The ongoing referendums are being covered widely by international outlets and mildly domestically. Coverage across the spectrum frames the voting as illegitimate\u00a0and forecasts the results to be not indicative of public opinion and predetermined by Russian officials.",
