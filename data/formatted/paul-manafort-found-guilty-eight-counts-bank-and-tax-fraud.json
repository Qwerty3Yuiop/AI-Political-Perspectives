    "summary": "Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, was convicted on Tuesday on eight counts of bank and tax fraud, with the judge declaring a mistrial on the ten remaining charges. Some on the Left have said that the verdict is legally troublesome for Trump, particularly as Manafort enters his second trial in the District of Columbia, while others on the Right claim that Manafort's conviction does nothing to show that the president colluded with Russia.",
