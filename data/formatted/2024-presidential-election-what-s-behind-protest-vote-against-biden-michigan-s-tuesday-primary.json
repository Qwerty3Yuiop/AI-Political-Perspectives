    "headline": "2024 Presidential Election What S Behind Protest Vote Against Biden Michigan S Tuesday Primary",
    "summary": "Many Arab- and Muslim-Americans, along with young and black voters, are planning to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d or \u201canything but Biden\u201d in Michigan\u2019s Tuesday primary to protest President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza.The Details:With slogans like \u201cGenocide Joe Has Got to Go,\u201d the Abandon Biden movement cites the president\u2019s early support for Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza and failure to call for a permanent ceasefire, as well as continued U.S. funding for Israel. As the reported Gaza death toll rises daily, these issues reportedly contributed to what The New Arab (Not Rated) called \u201ca sense ofbetrayal.\u201dFor Context:Biden won Michigan in 2020 by just 154,000 votes, making Arab-American and young voters key to securing the state\u2019s 15 electoral college votes in 2024. The Biden administration recentlyvetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an unconditional ceasefire,arguing it would harm separate ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas, which are happening via U.S., Qatari, and Egyptian mediators. Biden himself said Monday, \u201cMy hope is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:Coverage was common across the spectrum, but more so in left-rated outlets. Coverage from the left appeared more likely to focus specifically on Arab- and Muslim-Americans. Some coverage from the right focused on \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib\u2019s (D-MI) remarks on the issue.",
