    "summary": "An Israeli airstrike Thursday morning hit a Gaza school, killing civilians and potentially Hamas militants.For Context:The strike hit the\u00a0al-Sardi School, which was run by the United Nations (UN)\u00a0and sheltered refugees.\u00a0Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) estimated that 20\u201330 Hamas militants were in the school, which they were reportedly using as a base of operations.The Details:It's\u00a0unclear exactly how many were killed in the strike. A reporter for theTimes of Israel (Center bias)put the number at 27, the UN said 35, and Hamas-run\u00a0media reports from Gaza said 40. It also isn't clear how many of those killed, if any, were members of Hamas.Key Quote:UNRWA Chief\u00a0Philippe Lazzarini\u00a0said,\u00a0\"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims.\"How the Media Covered It:The Associated Press (Lean Left bias)said the strike was the \"latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge,\" and that it \"killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials,\" which is a larger estimate of women and children killed than center- and right-rated outlets issued. Some center outlets quoted death counts and responses to the strike from the IDF and Hamas next to each other. Outlets on the right were more likely to highlight the IDF justification and signaled more openness to the notion that the strike killed terrorists rather than innocent civilians.",
