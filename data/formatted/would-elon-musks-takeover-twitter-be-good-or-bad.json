    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to buy Twitterare fueling a sharp partisan split on whether the move would help or hurt the online flow of information.Musk offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share in cash, or about $43 billion, and said the platform \"needs to be transformed as a private company\" and has the \"potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe.\"\u00a0Twitter says its board is reviewing the proposal, which Musk calls his \"best and final offer.\"Media voices on the left and center often expressed concern about Musk's potential purchase of Twitter. One writer forWashington Post (Lean Left bias)argued that the move isan example of how rich people, \"without accountability, make decisions with potentially life-changing ramifications for many.\" WaPo columnist Max Boot said he was worried by Musk's efforts and alleged that he \"engages in online bullying and traffics in hyperbole and outrage.\"Right-rated voices often celebrated Musk's efforts as a potential win for free speech.National Review (Right bias)writer David Harsanyi accused concerned liberals oftrying to suppress dissent, and\u00a0of hypocrisy for not expressing similar concern \"at billionaire Carlos Slim, the New York Times\u2019 largest shareholder, or Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Washington Post.\"",
