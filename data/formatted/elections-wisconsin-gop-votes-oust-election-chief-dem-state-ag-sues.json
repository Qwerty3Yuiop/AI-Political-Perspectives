However, state Attorney General Josh Kaul (D)\u00a0sued,\u00a0arguing that Wolfe remained in office because the removal was not legitimate. Wolfe said she would not leave her post, calling state Republicans\u2019 removal vote \u201ca reaction to not achieving the political outcome they desire.\u201d Meanwhile,\u00a0Don Millis, the chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, penned anop-edblaming the commission\u2019s Democrats for the controversy because they previously declined to hold their own\u00a0vote to reappoint Wolfe, which Millis says they would have won.Related News:This isn\u2019t Wisconsin\u2019s only partisan controversy.
