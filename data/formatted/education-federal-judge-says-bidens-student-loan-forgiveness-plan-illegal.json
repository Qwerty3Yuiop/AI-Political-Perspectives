    "summary": "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan is illegal.Key Quotes:In his decision, U.S. District Judge Mark T. Pittman of the Northern District of Texaswrotethat \"the HEROES Act\u2014a law to provide loan assistance to military personnel defending our nation\u2014does not provide the executive branch clear congressional authorization to create a $400 billion student loan forgiveness program. The Program is thus an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative power and must be vacated.\" He continued by saying that the plan is \"either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises of legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the United States.\" In response, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said \"We will never stop fighting for hardworking Americans most in need\u2014no matter how many roadblocks our opponents and special interests try to put in our way.\"For Context:The program was alreadypauseddue to a separate legal challenge. In August, Bidenannounced a planfor borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year to have at least $10,000 of their federal student loan debt cancelled. The HEROES Act was one of the Biden administration's key justifications for proposing\u00a0the relief plan.
