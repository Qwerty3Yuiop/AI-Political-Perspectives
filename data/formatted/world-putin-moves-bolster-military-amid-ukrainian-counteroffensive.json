    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putinannounced Wednesday a \"partial mobilization\" in Russia, which will require thousands of citizens to fight in the invasion of\u00a0Ukraine.The mobilization means that reservists will be called up, and others with prior military experience will be subject to conscription. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Wednesday that thecountry will call up 300,000 reservists. Putin said the move was \"fully adequate to the threats we face, namely to protect our homeland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" He added that \"When its territorial integrity is threatened, Russia will use everything it can, this is not a bluff.\"After months of losing ground, Ukraine hasmounted a successful counteroffensivein recent weeks,regaining thousandsof square miles of Russian-controlled\u00a0territory in northeastern Ukraine. Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine will hold votes this week to seek annexation by Russia, a move that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed. \"The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,\" he said.Putin's announcement was the top story from news sources across the political spectrum, which tended tocover it similarly regardless of their bias rating.",
