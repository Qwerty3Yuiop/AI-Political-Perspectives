    "summary": "What impact will President Joe Biden\u2019srecent executive order restricting asylum claimshave on the southern border and the 2024 presidential election?From the Left:In theNew York Times Opinion (Left bias)a former immigration policy adviser for President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush argued that Biden \u201cis falling into the trap of believing that the only way to counter Republican criticism and appeal to voters for whom immigration is a top concern is to restrict asylum even further.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision will not curb unauthorized immigration, but will instead \u201clikely push people to cross at more dangerous areas along the border.\u201d Instead of recycling old border security tactics, the writer argued that Biden should \u201clead his party back to a time when fighting for the undocumented was a major policy priority alongside border security.\u201dFrom the Right:Noah Rothman (Lean Right bias)argued that Biden ignored the \u201cobviousness of the crisis\u201d at the southern border up until now out of \u201cfear of progressive criticism.\u201d Deeming Biden\u2019s executive order a cynical political move, Rothman determined, \u201cthe president\u2019s fondest hope that a display of theatrical gestures in the general direction of the border crisis repairs some of the damage to his brand among moderate and independent voters while eventually culminating in a court injunction that would mollify progressives.\u201d Rothman concluded, \u201cJust like every other foreign crisis this president has overseen, Biden\u2019s addiction to half-measures has made his circumstances \u2014 and ours \u2014 worse.\u201d",
