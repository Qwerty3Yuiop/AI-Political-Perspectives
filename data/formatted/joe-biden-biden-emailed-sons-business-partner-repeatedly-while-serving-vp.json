    "summary": "President Joe Biden emailed his son Hunter's business partner\u00a0dozens of times leading up to and after Hunter's appointment to the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, in 2014.The Details:House Republicans released adocumentshowing hundreds of emails sent between 2010 and 2019 from Joe Biden to Eric Schwerin, founding partner of Hunter\u2019s now-defunct Rosemont Seneca Partners investment firm.\u00a0The document doesn't include the messages sent but shows the email addresses used. Biden used multiple email aliases as part of the communications.\u00a0IRS whistleblower Joseph Ziegler gave the committee the email data during a closed-door hearing earlier this month.How the Right Covered It:Right-rated sources covered the document's release extensively when it happened. Many\u00a0framed it as more evidence that Biden was improperly involved in his son's Ukrainian business dealings.How Left and Center Covered It:AllSides only found two articles on the story from sources rated as being on the left or in the center. Utah-basedDeseret News (Center bias)covered alocal angleon the document on Dec. 6, andNBC News (Lean Left bias)covered it\u00a0two weeks later on Dec. 21. Deseret linked to the document detailing the emails. NBC did not and said it had not reviewed\u00a0it. NBC highlighted House Democrats who said Schwerin \"worked as Joe Biden\u2019s financial adviser from 2009 to 2017 and helped him file his tax returns.\" NBC's\u00a0headline also focused on how House Republicans released the records, framing it as a partisan act.",
