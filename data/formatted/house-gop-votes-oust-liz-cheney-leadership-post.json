    "headline": "House Gop Votes Oust Liz Cheney Leadership Post",
    "summary": "On Wednesday morning, House Republicans voted to oust GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney from her leadership post, punishing the conservative Wyoming Republican for her outspoken opposition to former President Donald Trump. Since the decision was made by voice vote, there was no tally of how the lawmakers voted, yet sources inside the closed-door session said it was an overwhelming vote against her.\n\nThis marks the first time in recent memory that a congressional GOP leader was toppled by rank-and-file Republicans in the middle of their term through a formal vote. Many see it as a sign of former President Donald Trump's influence on the GOP.",
