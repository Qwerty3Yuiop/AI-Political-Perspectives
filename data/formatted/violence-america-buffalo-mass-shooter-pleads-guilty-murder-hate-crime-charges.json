Gendron answered \"yes.\" Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 15, and\u00a0the judge will be required to sentence Gendron to life without parole\u00a0since he pleaded\u00a0guilty to the terrorism charge.Key Quotes:TheErie County District Attorney said after the hearing that\u00a0\"This racist murderer did not accomplish what he set out to do.
