    "summary": "Attorney General Merrick Garlandannounced Tuesdaythat the FBI and U.S. attorneys will\u00a0work with state and local\u00a0law enforcement to investigate \"a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school board members, teachers and workers in our nation\u2019s public schools.\" With students returning\u00a0to classrooms this fall, school board meetings have gone viral across the country as parents debate COVID-19 mask mandates and whether critical race theory (CRT) is included in curriculum. Garland's announcement did not mention a specific topic that the alleged threats were stemming from.Right-rated outlets and voices have paid much more attention to the issue than left- and center-rated sources. Many right-rated voices spoke\u00a0out against the announcement, calling it a federal overreach with little justification. Some accused the Biden administration of trying to silence dissent from parents who oppose mask mandates and don't want CRT being taught to their children. At least one left-rated voice\u00a0criticized Republican lawmakers who opposed Garland's decision, accusing them of siding with the \"rising tide of angry threats\" against school officials and seizing a chance \"to portray themselves as the courageous and oppressed.\"",
