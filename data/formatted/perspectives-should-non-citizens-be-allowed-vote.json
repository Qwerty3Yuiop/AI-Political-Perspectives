    "summary": "New York City just cleared the way for nearly 900,000 non-citizens to vote in elections for mayor,\u00a0city council\u00a0and other local offices. Should the rest of the country follow suit?Under the newrule, which is scheduled to take effect in January 2023, a person must live in the city for 30 days to qualify. Several places, such as San Francisco, already allow non-citizens to vote in some elections. Other places, such as North Dakota and Arizona, bar noncitizens from voting. Some legal experts say\u00a0New York state's Constitutionawards voting rights only to citizens.\u00a0Mayor Bill de Blasio\u00a0won't veto the decision but has mentioned \"big legal questions\" about the law and the need for\u00a0\"maximum incentive to finish the citizenship process.\"\u00a0The bill\u2019s primary sponsor says it will force politicians \"to spend the same amount of time in the communities affected by this legislation as they do in upper-class neighborhoods.\" The state's Republican Party isplanning actionagainst the law.Some opinions from left-rated sources praised the move as inclusive and legal, andcalled on other cities to adopt similar rules.\u00a0Right-rated outlets often highlighted legal doubts; one columnist\u00a0called the measure \"a form of national suicide.\" Other reports from the rightfocused on a senator's threat to pull federal fundingfrom New York and cities with similar laws. One writer for New York Daily News (Left bias)argued that New York should switch to an open primaryto allow votes from its nearly 1 million citizens who aren't\u00a0registered with a political\u00a0party.",
