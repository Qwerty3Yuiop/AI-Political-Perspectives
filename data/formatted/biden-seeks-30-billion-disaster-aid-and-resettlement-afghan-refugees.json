    "headline": "Biden Seeks 30 Billion Disaster Aid And Resettlement Afghan Refugees",
    "summary": "The White House budget office sent an \"urgent\" letter to Congress on Tuesday requesting\u00a0at least $30 billion to fund natural disaster aid and the resettlement of Afghan refugees.\u00a0At least $10 billion would be used to help states recover from\u00a0Hurricane Ida, while another $14 billion would be allocated for other natural disasters such as\u00a0hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. $6.4 billion of the package would be used to fund the processing and\u00a0relocation of tens of thousands of Afghans who helped the United Statesduring the two-decade war in Afghanistan. Shalanda Young, the White House Office of Management and Budget acting director, also asked Congress to attach the funds to a stopgap measure in order to avoid a partial government shutdown on Oct. 1.Coverage on this topic did not differ much across partisan lines. Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight how the stopgap measure would \"only temporarily keep the government funded through late November or December.\" Left-rated outlets were more likely to mention \"climate change\" in their reporting, pointing tothe increased number of extreme storms and disastersover the last number of months.",
