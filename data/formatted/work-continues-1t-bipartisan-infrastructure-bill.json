    "headline": "Work Continues 1t Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill",
    "summary": "Senators have spent much of the week debating amendments to theInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure proposal.\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday night that senators are \"very close to an agreement.\" A procedural vote on the bill is scheduled for Saturday. If passed, the legislation would provide federal funding for highways, waterworks, and broadband; it would also \"establish a pilot program to demonstrate a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee\" and put forth \"strategies to reduce the climate change impacts of the surface transportation system.\"The bill has been covered by outlets across the spectrum. Most coverage, especially from right-rated sources, highlighted an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office thatestimates the bill would add $256 billion to the national debt; some speculated about how that report may discourage Republican senators from voting for the bill.",
