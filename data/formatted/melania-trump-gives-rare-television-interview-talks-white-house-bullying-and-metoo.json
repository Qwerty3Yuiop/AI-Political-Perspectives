    "headline": "Melania Trump Gives Rare Television Interview Talks White House Bullying And Metoo",
    "summary": "In a rare television interview, First lady Melania Trump speaks on a wide range of topics, saying that she is one of the \"most bullied\" people in the world and that she distrusts several White House staffers. She also says that she stands with sexual assault survivors and that \"they need to be heard,\" but that they \"need to have really hard evidence\" if they come forward. \n\nMany Right-leaning publications emphasized her reticence towards some White House aides, particularly in the wake of the recent anonymous New York Times op-ed criticizing President Trump. Some also focused on her assertion that many companies won\u2019t work with her due to a bias against the president. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that organizations and foundations I want to partner with choose not to because of the administration,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI feel they are choosing politics over helping others.\u201d\n\nSeveral Left-leaning publications panned her comments on sexual misconduct, accusing her of being complicit and making it harder for survivors to tell their stories. She was also widely mocked for claiming she is one of the \u201cmost bullied\u201d people in the world, with many describing the claim as hypocritical when considering that the president is often criticized for bullying those he disagrees with.",
