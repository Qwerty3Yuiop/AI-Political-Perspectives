    "summary": "President Joe Biden is not Democrats' consensus pick to represent the party in the 2024 presidential election.Who might replace him to lead the party?Biden has said he'll run again in 2024, but heappears to lack\u00a0majority support from the party, with some voters concerned about his age or disillusioned with his performance as president. ACNN (Left bias)poll published Wednesdaysaysthat\u00a075% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than Biden in 2024, a sharp increase from earlier this year. Twenty-five percent said they'd prefer Biden as the nominee, a\u00a0drop from 45% when CNN did the same poll in January/February. Despite Biden's waning popularity,there's no clear-cut alternative. Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic Governors J.B. Pritzker (Ill.) and Gavin Newsom (Calif.) are the early front-runners, and some have alreadyengagedwith potential donors.\u00a0Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who all ran in 2020, are also possible replacements.Democrats' 2024 prospects arealready a big story across the spectrum. Some analyses from left-rated outlets highlighted voices who said Biden would likely still win the party's nomination if he ran. One opinion from Kevin Williamson atNational Review (Right bias)criticized Democrats for failing to have a clear back-up plan for\u00a0Biden, and framed\u00a0the party's\u00a0talent pool as old and scarce.",
