    "summary": "A U.S. drone strike that mistakenly killed 10 civilians in Kabul, Afghanistan has prompted criticism of the U.S. military and the Biden administration from across the spectrum. The Pentagoncalled the\u00a0strike a \"tragic mistake\" Fridayfollowing an internal investigation. It\u00a0was initially reported that the strike, which came days after the Kabul suicide bombing that killed over 170 people, killed terrorists who posed an imminent threat to Kabul's airport. The Air Force has been directed to appoint a general who will review the Pentagon's investigation.\u00a0Among the 10 killed in the strike were seven children and a former U.S. aid worker.Voices across the spectrum called for consequences for U.S. military leadership. Criticism of the strike was much more common from right-rated voices. Some compared the media's purportedly weak coverage of the mistake with the outrage that followeda drone strike that killed a top Iranian general last year, which was authorized by\u00a0former President Donald Trump. Few left-rated voices published opinions about the strike; some left-rated outlets didpublish \"letters to the editor\"from readers condemning it and urging leaders be held accountable.",
