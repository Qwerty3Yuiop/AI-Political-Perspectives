    "summary": "United States Attorney General Merrick Garland testified before the House Judiciary Committee, facing questions about the Justice Department\u2019s investigations into Hunter Biden, Donald Trump, and more.Details:The roughly six-hour hearing contained numerous charged moments where Republican committee members pressed Garland over the department\u2019s handling of investigations into the president\u2019s son and former President Donald Trump. Garland frequently declined to answer committee member\u2019s questions, citing department policy to not comment on ongoing investigations. This frustrated Republican committee members, who have previously accused the DOJ of creating a \u201ctwo-tiered justice system\u201d that favors Democratic Party members.Key Quotes:Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a frequent critic of the Justice Department, accused Garland of politicizing the DOJ, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s one investigation protecting President Biden, and there\u2019s another one attacking President Trump. The Justice Department\u2019s got both sides of the equation covered.\u201d Garland repeatedly rebuked these claims, at one point stating, \u201cI am not the president\u2019s lawyer. I will also add I am not Congress\u2019s prosecutor,\u201d and later stating, \u201cThe Justice Department treats everyone alike, regardless of party.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:In coverage from TheNew York Times (Lean Left bias), Garland was portrayed as a \u201csoft-spoken\u201d prosecutor adopting a \u201cmore aggressive approach\u201d as he faced off against a committee \u201cstocked with far-right Trump stalwarts.\u201d TheWashington Times (Lean Right bias)reported that Garland \u201cstumbled over questions\u201d and \u201cdodged questions\u201d regarding his involvement in the Hunter Biden investigation.",
