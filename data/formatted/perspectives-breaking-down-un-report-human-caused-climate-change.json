    "summary": "The United Nations'recent report on human-caused climate changerevived the debate over how serious an issue climate change is, and how drastically humanity should act on it. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report Monday saying the Earth could cross a critical temperature threshold in the next 10 years, roughly\u00a0a decade sooner than previously thought; the report also showed that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere reached a 2 million-year high in 2019. The report frames sharp cuts of\u00a0greenhouse gas emissions as the only way to stunt more global warming.Many voices on the left described the situation as dire, often framing the report's data about rising global temperatures in the context of recent heatwaves and wildfires. Some voices on the left and in the center also emphasized parts of the report that give reason for optimism, such as points about how reducing methane pollution could purportedly have immediate positive effects. Voices on the right often framed the UN report as overdramatic and lacking historical context, and criticized the media for purportedly exaggerating the seriousness of climate change; some highlighted how the report mentions that U.S. heat waves have become more common\u00a0since 1960, but doesn't directly address\u00a0that they're\u00a0no more frequent today than they were in 1900. Some voices in the center also focused on initiatives aimed at\u00a0finding common ground on\u00a0the environment among Americans.",
