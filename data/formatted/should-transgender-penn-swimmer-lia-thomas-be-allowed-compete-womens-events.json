    "summary": "A transgender swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania is breaking records and spurring debate about trans athletes across the political spectrum.After competing for the UPenn men\u2019s swimming team for three seasons and undergoing over two years of hormone replacement therapy as part of her transition from male to female, swimmer Lia Thomas\u00a0joined the school's women's team this year. She has posted the top times of any female college swimmer in two different events this season, and broke the\u00a0UPenn women's program record for fastest 200-meter and 500-meter freestyle times.Some of Thomas's teammates andcompetitors have voiced supportfor her right to compete as a woman; other voices in the sport,including 16 anonymous Penn women's swimmers, have supported her right to identify as trans while arguing that \"biologically, Lia holds an unfair advantage over competition in the women\u2019s category.\" Thomas has said that being trans \"has not affected my ability to do this sport.\"Many right-rated voices cite Thomas and her success in women's collegiate swimming\u00a0as the latest in a series of examples oftransgender athletes creating an uneven playing fieldfor cisgender competitors, and framed Thomas's career in men's swimming as unsuccessful. Opinions from left-rated voices typically placed less emphasis on Thomas breaking records, tended to frame her male career as more fruitful, and\u00a0highlighted the debate about trans athletes in the context of the LGBTQ+ community's growing push for acceptance and equity.",
