    "summary": "The Intercept(Left bias) releaseda video and an articleon Thursday criticizing journalists for the Daily Caller, Townhall and other right-rated news outlets for their coverage of protests and riots during the summer of 2020. The Intercept's article accuses \"members of an informal club of right-wing video journalists\" of distorting reality around the civil unrest and stoking \"the conservative media\u2019s hunger for images of destruction and violence on the margins of left-wing protests.\" The Intercept piece received significant blowback from the right side of the media, with many accusing the writers of advancing politically-motivated disdain instead of legitimate news. Intercept founderGlenn Greenwald, who has since left the outlet, accused the \"two white male reporters\" who wrote the piece of singling out journalists of color.\n\nThe story was barely covered by any left- and center-rated outlets as of Friday morning. It was much bigger news in right-rated outlets, where most were highly critical of The Intercept for publishing the piece and defensive of the protest and riot coverage from the right-rated journalists.",
