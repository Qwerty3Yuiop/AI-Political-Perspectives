    "summary": "World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesussaid Thursday at a press conferencethat there was a \u201cpremature push\u201d to dismiss\u00a0the COVID-19 lab leak theory without sufficient evidence. Tedros also called on China to be more transparent as health officials search for evidence of the pandemic's origins.\u00a0The theory that the pandemic began with a labaratory leak in Wuhan, China\u00a0was ruled out early in the pandemic as a debunked conspiracy by many Democratic leaders, public health officials and mainstream media outlets; former President Donald Trump and others on the right maintained that the scenario was possible.The theory has gained mainstream traction in recent monthsas scientists and officials have revisited evidence supporting the hypothesis, and as no \"smoking gun\" evidence for the pandemic's genesis has emerged.Many right-rated outlets highlighted Tedros' comments prominently on Friday, often while framing both China and the mainstream media in a negative light; many also focused on Tedros' remarks that \u201cit\u2019s common\" for lab accidents to happen. His statements were also covered by several center-rated sources, including theAssociated PressandInsider.\u00a0As of Friday morning, no left-rated outlets published original reporting on Tedros' comments; some, including Washington Post (Lean Left) and Los Angeles Times (Lean Left), republished the AP's story.",
