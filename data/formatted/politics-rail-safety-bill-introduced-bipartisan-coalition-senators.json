Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced legislation to strengthen safety procedures and requirements for trains carrying hazardous materials.Details:The Ohio senators championed the bill in response to thetrain crash in Ohio last month. A Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materialsderailed in East Palestine, Ohioand sparkedfears of environmental damage and public health dangers. The National Transportation Safety Board cited anoverheated wheel bearingas the cause of the derailment. The Association of American Railroads determined some of the proposed rule changes to be arbitrary. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has voiced support for the bill.Key Quotes:\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned here,\u201d Vance told Politico, \u201cis that it\u2019s very easy to disagree with people so long as you\u2019re not an a**hole, and still get things done.\u201d Vance added that he expected Washington \u201cto be so partisan, that it would be harder to get anything done. In reality, so long as you\u2019re not being a total jerk about it, I think it\u2019s possible to do things.\u201d Brown is quoted in the Wall Street Journal stating, \u201cit shouldn\u2019t take a massive railroad disaster for elected officials to put partisanship aside and work together for the people we serve\u2014not corporations like Norfolk Southern.\u201dHow The Media Covered It:The introduction of the bill was covered mildly. Across the spectrum, outlets highlighted the bipartisan efforts to advance the legislation.",
