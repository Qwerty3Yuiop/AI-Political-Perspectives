    "summary": "What will come of theimpeachment probe into President Joe Bidenlaunched by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA)?From the Left:Left-rated voices argue the probe is political theater pushed by the far-right branch of the House Republicans, who are using the party\u2019s thin majority to hold McCarthy \u201chostage\u201d by threatening to oust him from the speakership. A writer for theDaily Beast (Left bias)said McCarthy \u201cmade his deal with the devil\u201d during the speaker vote in January and is now being forced to launch the probe in order to get far-right Republicans to vote in favor of spending bills. A writer inThe Atlantic (Left bias)also argued the probe is \u201cas much about exacting revenge on behalf of the twice-impeached former President Donald Trump as it is about prosecuting Biden\u2019s alleged misdeeds.\u201dFrom the Right:Right-rated voices are split on the potential outcome of the probe.Noah Rothman (Lean Right bias)stated that Republicans \u201cdo not yet have a smoking gun,\u201d but determined Democrats were prematurely dismissing allegations of misconduct committed by Biden \u201cgiven the degree to which the GOP\u2019s investigations have produced new and discomfiting evidence undermining Biden\u2019s public statements.\u201d A writer in theWashington Examiner (Lean Right)warned that \u201cthe public is sickof and disgusted with politicized death matches\u201d and, \u201cto threaten to kick a president from office is to threaten massive political upheaval of a sort that should be reserved for only rare and serious offenses.\u201d",
