    "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's influence over the Republican Party was put to the test Tuesday in Georgia's2022 midterm election primaries.Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) defeated businessman and former Sen.\u00a0David Perdue, who was backed by former President Donald Trump, in theRepublican Gubernatorial Primary\u00a0in Georgia.\u00a0 Kemp will face politician and lawyer Stacey Abrams in November.\u00a0 Herschel Walker, who was also backed by Trump, safely won theRepublican Senate Primary in Georgia, and will face Democratic Sen.\u00a0Raphael Warnock\u00a0in November.In other primary races Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton defeated Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in theRepublican run-off for Texas Attorney General, and former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders won the Republican nomination for Arkansas Governor.\u00a0 In\u00a0Alabama, Congressman Mo Brooks will face a run-off with attorney Katie Britt for the Republican Senate nomination there.Georgia's races were the main focus from outlets across the political spectrum. Many left and center-rated sources highlighted\u00a0Perdue's loss, while some on the right focused\u00a0on Walker's win and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's victory against a crowded field in the state's 11th Congressional District.\u00a0Some on the right say it's a\u00a0mistake to write off Trump's influence, especially in primaries without an incumbent.\u00a0 Kemp, for instance, was able to use his powers to pass legislation that pleased pro-Trump voters, while also rallying the support of state power players in Georgia.",
