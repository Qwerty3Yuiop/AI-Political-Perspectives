Theaverage price of a gallon of gas in the U.S.hit a record high on Tuesday, andoil prices also hit a 14-year-high.Voices on all sides have beenquestioning U.S. dependence on Russian oilsince the invasion began, and sources across the spectrum analyzed how Biden's announcement may worsen already-high energy costs for U.S. consumers. Right-rated sources often highlightedBiden's previous stances against increasing U.S. oil productionas a reason for high energy costs. Some coverage from left-rated outlets suggested that Biden waited to announce the ban due to fear that the move would raise energy costs for Americans.",
