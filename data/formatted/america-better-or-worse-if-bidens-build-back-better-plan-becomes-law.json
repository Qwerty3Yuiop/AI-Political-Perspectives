    "summary": "A key part of President Joe Biden's agenda is in jeopardy.\u00a0Is it a major loss, or are we better off without it?Moderate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has been a major opponent of Biden's multi trillion-dollar spending plan\u00a0andsaid\u00a0this weekthat he won't vote for it.Many Republicansand business groups,such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, side with Manchin and argue that the plan is bad for the economy. Most other Democrats, as well assome labor unions, have criticized\u00a0Manchin's opposition, with someaccusing him of corruptionin favor of fossil fuels over clean\u00a0energy.\u00a0The $1.75\u00a0trillion plan is a significantly reduced version of Biden's initial $3.5 trillion proposal. Many Democrats say the plan's costs will be offset by the money it raises through a wealth tax and other measures. Republicans tout an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office thatestimates the plan will add $367 billion to the national debtby 2031.Left-rated voices argue that the plan will fight climate change and inject money into impoverished areas, and focus on potential consequences if the plan fails. Right-rated voices say the plan will worsen inflation whilepiling onto the national debt; some paint Democrats' failure to pass the bill\u00a0as an example of Biden's purported shortcomings as president. Some on the lefthighlight poll datathat suggests West Virginians support Build Back Better and frame that as evidence of Manchin's corruption. Some on the righthighlight\u00a0datathat says West Virginians oppose the plan.",
