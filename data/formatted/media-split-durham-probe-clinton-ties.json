    "summary": "Left and right\u00a0media are\u00a0divided over whether a special counsel's investigation shows\u00a0that Hillary Clinton paid to spy on the Trump White House.In a recent\u00a0court filing from special counsel John Durham, who is probing\u00a0the government's investigation of Russian election interference, he accused a tech\u00a0executive\u00a0of working with a\u00a0Clinton campaign lawyer and distorting private\u00a0White House datain an effort to show evidence of collusion between\u00a0former President Donald Trump and Russia.\u00a0The lawyer was\u00a0indicted last year for lying to the FBI about his connections to Clinton. Some on the right said the filing\u00a0wassignificant evidence that\u00a0Clinton paid to spy on Trump, and some\u00a0on the leftcharacterized that narrative as false or exaggerated. Durham said this week that any media misinterpretation of information in\u00a0the filing \"does not in any way undermine the valid reasons for the government\u2019s inclusion of this information.\" Trump\u00a0said the news was \"bigger than Watergate,\" Clinton accused him of\u00a0\"spinning up a fake scandal.\"Many voices on the right\u00a0accuse\u00a0left- and center-rated media\u00a0of ignoring or downplaying the probe due to anti-Trump media bias. Left-rated media often frames Durham's probe as less meaningful, and some accuse Fox News and other right-wing sources of distorting the probe and spreading misinformation about Clinton.\u00a0Some left- and center-rated media said Durham was \"distancing himself\" from conservatives who purportedly politicize his investigation; some on the right said Durham was standing\u00a0by his evidence.",
