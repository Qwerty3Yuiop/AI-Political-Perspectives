    "summary": "A White House officialtweeted Fridaythat the U.S. plans to lift travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international travelers beginning Nov. 8. The announcement applies to both air and land travel. Under the new rule, vaccinated travelers from most countries will be permitted to come to the U.S. for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unvaccinated foreigners will remain mostly banned, and unvaccinated Americans will need a negative COVID-19\u00a0test before returning to the U.S. The White House announced earlier this week thatland borders with Canada and Mexico would reopen on Nov. 8.The news was covered across the spectrum Friday. Some coverage from left- and center-rated sources highlighted how the new guidance will reunite families who were kept apart by pandemic restrictions. Some reports from right-rated sources raised questions about the announcement, such as how the rule would apply to unauthorized migrants at the US-Mexico border, and what travel restrictions would be for children who are not yet eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine.",
