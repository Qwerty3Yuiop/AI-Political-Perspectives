    "summary": "Democrats and Republicans have reached a\u00a0temporary solution to the nation's debt limit dilemma, but the partisan split on how to solve the problem remains.Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y)accepted an offer Thursdayfrom Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to raise the debt limit by $480 billion, which is expected to last into December.\u00a0Eleven\u00a0Republicans and the 50 Democratic senators voted\u00a0to break a\u00a0filibuster on the matter Thursday evening, and the actual measure then passed by a\u00a050-48 party-line vote. It is widely expected to pass the House. Schumer later criticized Republicans, saying \"they played a dangerous and risky\"\u00a0game\u00a0by opposing the debt measure until that point. Republicans say Democrats should use budget reconciliation to raise the debt limit to a fixed amount by themselves, since they hold the majority and already plan to\u00a0use the process to pass trillions of dollars in new spending. Democratic leaders say they won't, arguing that the process should be\u00a0bipartisan. The U.S. Treasurypreviously warned of an economic recessionif the limit wasn't boosted by mid-October.Coverage across the spectrum highlighted the remaining partisan divide and ultimately unresolved debt limit issue, as well as\u00a0Republican disapproval of McConnell's offer; some Republican lawmakers and right-rated voices criticized McConnell for purportedly caving to Democrats. Reports from the right also focused on Republican criticism of Schumer's comments after the speech.",
