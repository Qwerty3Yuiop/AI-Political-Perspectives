    "summary": "Four top U.S. gymnaststestifiedbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday about the FBI\u2019s investigation of former national team doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving the equivalent of a life sentence for multiple sex crimes. Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols called for accountability and said that FBI agents had falsified\u00a0statements, delayed interviews\u00a0after\u00a0complaints, failed to properly report and investigate sexual assault allegations, failed to properly document evidence, and knowingly allowed Nassar to continue abusing minors. The gymnasts often cited aJustice Department OIG reportfrom July on the FBI\u2019s investigation. Days before the hearing, the FBIfired the agent involved in Maroney\u2019s case. FBI Director Christopher Wray also testified at the hearing and apologized for the FBI\u2019s \u201cinexcusable\u201d mishandling of the investigation.Most outlets across the spectrum prominently featured this story on Wednesday\u00a0evening. Coverage was broadly balanced and supportive of the gymnasts regardless of the outlet\u2019s bias rating. Coverage tended to focus\u00a0primarily on one of the gymnasts, usually Simone Biles. Sensationalist language was also common, including \u201cscathing,\u201d \u201cexplosive\u201d and \u201cgut-wrenching.\u201d",
