On Friday, police arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra in connection with the murder. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed later that Ibarra entered the U.S. illegally.

Ron DeSantis\u2019 press secretary Christina Pushawsaid,\u00a0\u201cThe corporate media will blame a woman for exercising alone before blaming an illegal alien for killing her.\u201dThe AP Story:The AP articlewas framed around the potential dangers women face while jogging alone, stating that \u201cCrime statistics indicate that these types of attacks are rare, but they underscore the hypervigilance women must take when going out, even for a run on campus.\u201d The article cited similar incidents in recent years and quoted other women runners\u2019 reactions to Riley\u2019s murder. This was not the only coverage of the incident published by the AP. On Saturday, the outletpublished an article reporting Ibarra\u2019s arrest.\u00a0This article, published before ICE confirmed Ibarra\u2019s immigration status, said Ibarra\u2019s immigration status was not yet known.How the Media Covered It:Right-rated outlets are covering the backlash, often only including quotes critical of the AP.Why the Difference?:Right-rated news sources are more likely to focus on crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants because they\u00a0highlight\u00a0the potential dangers of illegal immigration, an issue of greater importance to the political right.",
