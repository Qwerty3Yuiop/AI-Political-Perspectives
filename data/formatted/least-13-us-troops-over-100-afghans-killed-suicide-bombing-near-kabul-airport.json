    "summary": "Islamic terrorists attacked\u00a0crowds of people near the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan Thursday, in a suicide bombing and gunfire that killed\u00a0nearly 200 people and wounded\u00a0at least 140 more. Among the dead are 13\u00a0U.S. service members and more than 100\u00a0Afghans; it's the deadliest incident for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since 2011. Earlier Thursday, the U.S. and other nations had warned of possible terrorist attacks near the airport due to threats from Islamic militants. The Pentagon has blamed Islamic terror groups for the attacks; the Islamic State claimed responsibility Thursday afternoon. The airport is the epicenter of a massive evacuation effort as thousands flee the country amid the Taliban's return to power. On Thursday evening, President Joe Biden promised retaliation against ISIS-K, the regional affiliate of the Islamic State responsible for the attack,\u00a0saying, \u201cWe will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.\u201d Biden added that this retaliation would not interfere with the Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline. On Friday,military officials said that only one explosion happened near the airport Thursday; two separate explosions were initially reported by sources across the spectrum.Countries including\u00a0the U.S. are racing to evacuate their citizens and allies, many with limited means of escape,\u00a0from\u00a0Afghanistan before the Aug. 31 deadline.Updated 8/27/21 at 8:32 a.m. ET with the Pentagon's clarification.",
