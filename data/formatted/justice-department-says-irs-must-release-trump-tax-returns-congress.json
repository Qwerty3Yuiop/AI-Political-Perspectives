    "summary": "The Treasury Department must release former President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns to the Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel said Friday. Acting Assistant Attorney General Dawn Johnsen wrote in amemothat the committee had \u201cinvoked sufficient reasons for requesting the former President\u2019s tax information,\u201d satisfying the requirement that tax information requested from the executive branch serve a \u201clegitimate legal purpose.\u201d Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who chairs the committee,originally requested the documents in 2019for the stated purpose of studying the IRS\u2019\u00a0mandatory presidential audit program. However, the Trump Justice Department ruled that the committee\u2019s request was politically motivated; thus, the Trump administration refused to release the records and ignored asubpoena, prompting the House tofile a lawsuit.Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with coverage in left-rated outlets slightly more likely to bring up Rep. Neal\u2019s subpoenas than coverage in right-rated outlets. While most headlines across the spectrum used forceful language to convey that the Treasury\u00a0\u201cmust\u201d hand over the documents, headlines inFox NewsandBloombergsaid that the the Treasury\u00a0\u201ccan\u201d release the documents.",
