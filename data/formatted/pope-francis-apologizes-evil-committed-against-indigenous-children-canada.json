    "summary": "Pope Francis on Monday publicly apologized\u00a0for the\u00a0Catholic Church's role\u00a0in the \"evil\" committedagainst several generations of indigenous childrenat Canadian residential schools.The Pope described his six-day visit to Canada as a\u00a0\"penitential pilgrimage\" and expressed regret for the \"many Christians who supported the colonizing mentality of the powers that oppressed the indigenous peoples.\" Between 1881 and 1996, Canada\u2019s government and the\u00a0Catholic Churchseparated over\u00a0150,000 children from their familiesand sent them to residential schools. Students were\u00a0forced\u00a0to\u00a0\"assimilate\" into white Canadian society and were brutally punished if they expressed aspects of\u00a0their indigenous identities.A\u00a0delegation of indigenous peoples with the Assembly of First Nations traveled to the Vatican in April and received an initial apology from the pope. Canada\u2019s\u00a0Catholic Church has nowpledged over\u00a0$50 million in cash and in-kind contributionsto the indigenous groups affected by the \"catastrophic\" school policies\u00a0and anticipated an additional $30 million in donations over the next five years.Coverage from right-rated outletscast doubt on the validity of the 751 unmarked graves extensively highlighted\u00a0by media outlets\u00a0last year, emphasizing how \"not one body\" was found and that indigenous Canadians were aware of the site's existence \"before the media cast light on them.\"Some left-rated reportshighlighted how the Pope's visit \"triggered more pain\" for the indigenous school survivors and that\u00a0thousands of more\u00a0mass graves are \"expected\" to be found.",
