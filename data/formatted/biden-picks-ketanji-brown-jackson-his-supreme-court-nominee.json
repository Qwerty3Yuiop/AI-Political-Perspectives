    "summary": "President Joe Biden has selected Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as his pick to fill\u00a0the Supreme Court seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer at the end of the term this summer.\u00a0 If she is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, which is split 50-50 along party lines, she will be the first black woman on the high court's bench.\u00a0 Her nomination, once sent to the Senate, will be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\u00a0 After confirmation hearings, her nomination will go to the Senate\u00a0floor for a final vote.Judge Brown, 51, has served for eight years as federal trial court judge, and was on ashort list of contendersconsidered by the White House.\u00a0 Last June, she was confirmed for a seat on the D.C. Court of Appeals.\u00a0 Her most prominent decision to date was perhaps an opinion ordering President Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify in the\u00a0House Judiciary Committee's investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. It is believed that her addition to the Supreme Court would not fundamentally shift its 6-3 conservative majjority balance.",
