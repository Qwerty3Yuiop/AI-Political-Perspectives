    "headline": "Fda Panel Recommends Booster Shots Individuals Over 65 And High Risk",
    "summary": "An FDA advisory panel voted unanimously in favor of COVID-19 vaccinebooster shotsfor individuals 65 and older and those at high risk of severe COVID-19 after rejecting booster shots for everyone 16 and older by a vote of 16-2. The panel\u2019s vote influences but does not determine the ultimate decision for approval. Over 2 million Americans have received a booster shot since August 13, according toCDC data released Friday.Coverage across the spectrum varied on framing the votes as a rejection of the \u201c16 and older\u201d approval or an endorsement of the \u201c65 and older\u201d approval. Because the \u201c65 and older\u201d vote was not originally planned and came after the \u201c16 and older\u201d vote, some coverage shortly after the panel\u2019s meeting said only that the panel \u201crejected\u201d booster shots. Coverage in some outlets framed the votes as a blow tothe Biden administration\u2019s plansto widely distribute booster shots.",
