John Katko, the top lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee, who said in a joint statement that, \"there has been a growing consensus that the January 6th attack is of a complexity and national significance that what we need [is] an independent commission to investigate.\"The bill faces opposition from several GOP leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McConnell said Wednesday that he opposes the legislation because it is a \u201cslanted and unbalanced proposal.\u201dFormer President Donald Trumpreleased a statement Tuesday evening describing the bill as a \u201cDemocrat trap,\" and urging McConnell and other GOP leaders to start \u201clistening.\u201dCoverage from across the political spectrum tended to focus on the details of the bill, highlight Republican opposition, and provides peculation as to the bill's likelihood of passing.",
