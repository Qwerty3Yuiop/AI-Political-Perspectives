    "summary": "A new documentary fromDaily Wire's (Right bias) Matt Walsh, titled\"What is a Woman?\", has sparked very different reactions\u00a0across the political spectrum.In the film, Walsh asks\u00a0people in the U.S. and elsewhere \u2014 from\u00a0transgender activists, people who'vetransitioned but\u00a0regret it, andU.S. pediatricianstoa remote African tribe\u2014 to\u00a0define the word \"woman\" and explain how they view gender roles and identities.\u00a0In an interview\u00a0with National Review about the film, Walsh accused progressives of trying to \"rid society of any notion of a shared reality or shared truth,\" and said that the film's title and premise represents a question \"that the gender ideologues can\u2019t answer, and it kind of brings down the whole fa\u00e7ade of gender ideology.\"On Twitter, Walshsaidthat many media critics who were asked to review the film declined, with some responding to the request by condemning the transphobia and\u00a0\"right-wing propaganda\" that the film\u00a0purportedly advances.The right has focused much more on \"What is a Woman?\" than sources on\u00a0the left and center, few of which have offered any coverage of it. One writer for LGBTQ Nation said\u00a0it \"provides ammunition for those who seek to deprive transgender people of access to affirming and life-saving healthcare.\"\u00a0Many on the right\u00a0supported Walsh's points. One Washington Examiner writer said the documentary \"exposes the impossible logical gymnastics gender ideology demands\" and \"documents the ways in which it is harming individuals, their families, and communities.\"",
