    "summary": "The U.S. military is evacuating\u00a0American citizens and Afghans from Afghanistan as people flee the country followingthe government's collapse and Taliban takeover. A Pentagon spokesperson said U.S. military planes can evacuate 5,000 to 9,000 people per day from the\u00a0Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Thousands are trying to escape the country at the airport, creating chaos and confusion; meanwhile, reports are circulating of Taliban fighters complicating airport access and violently breaking up demonstrations.\u00a0The U.S.' self-imposed\u00a0deadline to evacuate Americans from Afghanistan is Aug. 31; the White House said Thursday that U.S. troops may stay longer than that to continue evacuations if there are still Americans in the country.The evacuations are a top story across the political spectrum. Many reports focused on potential danger and consequences some Afghans face if they don't escape, especially women, children and people who worked with the Afghan government or the U.S. military. Others highlightedreports that U.S. aircraft weren't leaving Kabul at\u00a0full capacitythis week, and framed the evacuation operation as falling short.",
