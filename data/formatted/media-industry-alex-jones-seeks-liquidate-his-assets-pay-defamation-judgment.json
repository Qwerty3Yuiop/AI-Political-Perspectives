    "summary": "Alex Jones is seeking to liquidate his personal assets in order to pay his defamation judgement to the families of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting.For Context:In 2022, a Connecticut jury concluded that Alex Jones, host ofInfoWars (Right bias), should pay$965 million in defamation retributionto the family members of those killed in the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. The defamation suit came from a number of statements made by Jones in the aftermath of the shooting, including claims that the massacre was a hoax concocted to restrict gun rights.Details:Jones\u2019 previously filed for bankruptcy, but on Thursday, his attorney submitted a new filing requesting to change to a Chapter 7 liquidation. Included in the expected liquidation is Free Speech Systems, the parent company of InfoWars, Jones\u2019 media outlet. A sale of Free Speech Systems would mean Jones would no longer control the media outlet he founded in the 1990s.Key Quotes:\u201cThere is no reasonable prospect of a successful reorganization,\u201d Jones\u2019 lawyer said in the filing.How the Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum characterized Jones as a \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201dCNN (Lean Left bias)specifically labeled him a \u201cright-wing conspiracy theorist,\u201d adding that he has used InfoWars to \u201cpoison the public discourse with vile lies and conspiracy theories, but also to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars.\u201d A large portion of coverage across the spectrum focused on a recent emotional outburst from Jones during an episode of InfoWars.",
