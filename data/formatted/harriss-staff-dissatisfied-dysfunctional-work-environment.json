    "summary": "On Wednesday,Politico reportedthat aides and officials on Vice President Kamala Harris's staff were dissatisfied with their work environment, with some calling it\u00a0\"tense\" and \"dysfunctional.\" Much of the criticism is aimed at Harris' chief of staff,\u00a0Tina Flournoy; Flournoy reportedly restricts staff and allies' access to Harris, creating tension in the office and among outside donors and supporters. According to Politico, Harris's recent announcement of her trip to the southern border left her staff \"scrambling\" with little time to make necessary preparations.\u00a0While Flournoy was heavily criticized, two anonymous administration officials said Harris is ultimately\u00a0responsible for the way her office is run. Harris's spokesperson Symone Sanders told Politico that staff should raise issues directly, and called the anonymous officials \"cowards.\" Sanders said,\u00a0\"We are not making rainbows and bunnies all day. What I hear is that people have hard jobs and I\u2019m like \u2018welcome to the club.' \"After Politico first published the story, it was widely covered by right-rated outlets and received little coverage from left-rated outlets.Some left-ratedoutlets raised\u00a0the issue of a double standard for women and men in power, ard argued that men would not be criticized for having a \"tough and demanding\" office environment.\u00a0Some right-rated outlets also tended to highlight criticism of Harris's handling of her immigration assignment.",
