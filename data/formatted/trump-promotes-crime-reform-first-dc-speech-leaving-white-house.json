He advocated for\u00a0the death penalty as punishment for convicted drug dealers, claiming that\"you\u2019ll save 500 lives\" by executing a\u00a0drug dealer. Trump suggested police squad cars should\u00a0be parked on \"every corner\" of\u00a0American streets that \"are riddled with needles and soaked with the blood of innocent victims.\"Other ideas that the former president promoted included\u00a0moving homeless people out of cities, reinstating stop-and-frisk policies and\u00a0terminating policies that promote the \"sexualization of minor children.\" Trump alsoclaimedthat he \"ran a second time\" and \"did much better,\"labeling\u00a0the 2020 election a \"catastrophe\" and \"disgrace to our country.\"Hecontinued to tease\u00a0his 2024 presidential runand told the crowd that\u00a0\"we may just have to do it again.\"Left-rated coveragefocused more on how Trump\u00a0repeated his\u00a0\"false election claims\" that led up to\u00a0the \"Jan. 6 insurrection\" and \"praised\" the policies of\u00a0Chinese President Xi Jinping.Right-rated outletswere more likely to label Trump's appearance as a \"homecoming of sorts\" and accentuated that the Biden administration's \"lax criminal-justice policies\" has led to \"surging violent crime rates in nearly every major American city.\"",
