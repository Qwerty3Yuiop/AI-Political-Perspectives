    "summary": "During the second week ofRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, outlets across the spectrum published perspectives on how the conflict might eventually end.The various suggestions for ending the war came as diplomatic talks between Russia and Ukraine consistently failed to produce an end tothe conflict. Talks on Thursdayappeared to fail as well; while Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kulebasaid he proposed a 24-hour cease-fire, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov later said that \u201cno one here wasdiscussing a cease-fire.\u201dPerspectives on the war\u2019s potential endings were more common in center-rated outlets. Voices in left and right-rated outlets tended to focus more on the war's implications for U.S. politics.\u00a0Several voices across the spectrum focused on China\u2019s relationship to the war, including the potential for the country toput pressure on Russia.",
