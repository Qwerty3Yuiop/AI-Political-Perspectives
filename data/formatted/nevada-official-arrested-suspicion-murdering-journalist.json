Telles is suspected of murdering Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who was found\u00a0fatally stabbed Saturday. A judge ruled Thursday that Telles would be held without bail.\u00a0Clark County's sheriff\u00a0said that \"every murder is tragic but the killing of a journalist is particularly troublesome.\"\u00a0The district attorney called the evidence \"compelling\"\u00a0and said he expects Telles to be charged with murder next week.German spent 30 years covering crime and corruption in the Las Vegas area. In recent months,he wrote about claims of bullying and hostility in Telles's office, including allegations that Telles fostered a hostile work environment and had\u00a0an inappropriate relationship with a staffer.German's death and Telles's arrest werecovered prominently by news sources from left to right. Many headlines across the spectrum highlighted how prosecutors said Telles's\u00a0DNA was found under German's fingernails. Right-rated sources focused more on how Telles is a Democrat.National Review (Right bias)writerJim Geraghty (Lean Right bias)cited other recent examples of Democrats in New Jersey and California being convicted in connection to wrongful deaths, and quipped that \"I think we're starting to see why some in that party were so enthusiastic about the notion of abolishing the police.\"",
