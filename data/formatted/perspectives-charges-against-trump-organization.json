    "headline": "Perspectives Charges Against Trump Organization",
    "summary": "The Trump Organization has beencharged with 15 counts of tax fraud and other crimesby New York prosecutors. The Manhattan district attorney's office unsealed an indictment Thursday that detailed charges against the organization for attempting to compensate \"Trump Organization executives in a manner that was 'off the books.'\"\u00a0Chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg was the indictment's focus, and is accused of tax evasion on $1.76 million\u00a0in income dating back to 2005. It's the first criminal case against Trump's company; the former president himself was not charged with any wrongdoing, and accused prosecutors of leading a \"witch hunt.\"Voices across the spectrum analyzed how the charges may impact\u00a0Trump. Legal experts, regardless of potential ideological bias, have drawn different conclusions. Some say New York's continued probes could likely lead to charges against him due to his close ties with the organization;others doubt that scenario, saying the lack of charges against Trump to this point means a\u00a0future charge\u00a0\"appears increasingly unlikely.\"\u00a0Many right-rated voices have accused New York prosecutors of pursuing Trump for politically-motivated reasons, and have framed the charges against the Trump Organization as weak and unlikely to amount to any legitimate legal consequences for the former president.",
