    "headline": "Texas Law Banning Most Abortions Goes Effect",
    "summary": "A Texas abortion law that bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected\u00a0took effect Wednesday after the Supreme Court decided not to act on an emergency petition filed by abortion providers\u00a0to stop the measure.The Heartbeat\u00a0Act (SB 8)bans abortions around the six-week mark, and allows individuals to sue anyone suspected of helping a woman get an abortion.The law allows for a exemption for \"medical emergencies,\" but does not provide an exception for rape or incest.\u00a0 It is one of most restrictive abortion bans in the United States. Critics argue that many women don't yet know they're pregnant at the six-week mark; Texas state Sen. and sponsor of the bill Bryan Hughes (R) called it \u201cthe most powerful pro-life legislation in Texas history.\u201d",
