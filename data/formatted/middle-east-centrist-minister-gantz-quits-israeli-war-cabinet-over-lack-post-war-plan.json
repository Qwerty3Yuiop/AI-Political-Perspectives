    "summary": "Benny Gantz, leader of Israel\u2019s National Unity party, resigned from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s emergency war cabinet on Sunday, saying Netanyahu \u201cprevents us from progressing to real victory.\u201dFor Context:Gantz had previously said he would leave the war government on June 8 unless Netanyahu adopted a new plan for the war, including plans for post-war Gaza. Netanyahu refused, saying Gantz should have issued an ultimatum to Hamas instead. Gantz had planned a press conference for Saturday night, but delayed it after Israel successfully rescued four hostages in an operation that reportedly resulted in 274 Palestinian deaths. Gantz had previously served as the chief of staff for the Israeli Defense Forces; his decision to leave is seen as a significant shift in Israel\u2019s political landscape.Key Quotes:Saying he and his allies joined the war cabinet \u201cbecause we knew it was a bad government,\u201d Gantz said that recently, \u201cfateful strategic decisions are met with hesitation and procrastination due to [narrow] political considerations,\u201d per a translation byThe Times of Israel (Center bias). Netanyahu wrote on X, \u201cBenny, this is not the time to abandon the campaign \u2014 this is the time to join forces.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:Coverage was common across the spectrum on Sunday and Monday, generally aligning on describing Gantz and the impact of his departure. However, Breitbart (Right bias) stood out by highlighting speculation of collaboration between Gantz and the Biden administration, which has also pushed Netanyahu to adopt a plan for post-war Gaza.This summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.",
