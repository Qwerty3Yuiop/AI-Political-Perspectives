    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in challenges brought by Texas and Louisiana against the Biden Administration's deportation policies.For Context:After two hours of oral arguments, it wasn't clear how the court might rule on the case, with the six conservatives justices appearing indecisive. In September 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)announcedthat it would focus on deporting\u00a0people deemed risks\u00a0to national security, public safety, and border security. Officials from Texas and Louisiana, along with others,saidthose priorities\u00a0contradict\u00a0federal laws requiring deportations of\u00a0other unauthorized immigrants who might not fit that specific criteria. A U.S. district judge agreed and vacated the new policies in June, and the Supreme Courtupheldthat ruling but agreed to hear arguments in the case.Key Quotes:Liberal Justice Elena Kagan argued that conservative-controlled courts stopped \"a federal immigration policy in its tracks.\" Conservative Justice Samuel Alito accused the U.S. solicitor general, who was arguing for the administration, of advocating for \"a rule of special hostility to state standing.\"How the Media Covered It:Right-rated media often\u00a0framed the policies as having encouragedrecord levels of migrants arriving at the southern border, and some suggested it was a ploy by the Biden Administration to deport fewer people. Left- and center-rated outlets focused more on how\u00a0the court didn't indicate a clear consensus on the matter during Tuesday's arguments.",
