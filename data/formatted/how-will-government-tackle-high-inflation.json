    "headline": "How Will Government Tackle High Inflation",
    "summary": "High prices are impacting just about everyone, from grocery stores and gas pumps to the White House and 2022 candidates.Consumer inflation isat its highest point in 40 years, andprices for producersare also near record highs. Despite high inflation,retail spending rose faster than expectedin January, which acts as evidence of a strong economy along withcontinued jobs growth. Reports across the spectrum say that Federal Reserve officials voiced concern about inflation during their January meeting and discussed raising interest rates faster than previously planned to combat high prices, potentially as early as March.Reports across the spectrum highlighted the political pressure inflation puts on Biden and Democrats heading into the2022 midterm elections, and how concerns about inflation conflict with Biden's spending plans. Many sources focused on how inflation hurts voters by raising prices andweakening wages. Some coverage from left-rated sources highlighted voices who were optimistic about inflation ending sooner, and\u00a0argued that higher interest rates could cause lower wages and fewer jobs. Reports from right-rated sources more often focused on the extent of high retail prices and framed Biden's spending plans as excessive and a driver of inflation.",
