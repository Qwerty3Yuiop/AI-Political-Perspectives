    "headline": "Taxes Will Biden S Tax Bill Solve Debt Crisis And Fund Medicare",
    "summary": "The Biden Administration unveiled a new tax proposal Tuesday aimed at reducing the national deficit by $2 trillion over the next decade and funding Medicare programs into the 2050s. The key points of the proposed legislation are a tax increase from 3.8% to 5% on those earning more than $400,000 per year and increasing Medicare\u2019s ability to negotiate prescription drug prices.Biden\u2019s Argument:In a piece published in The New York Times Opinion, President Biden said some Republican lawmakers have \u201cthreatened our economy unless I agree to benefit cuts,\u201d writing that \u201conly in Washington can people claim that they are saving something by destroying it.\u201d Regarding the tax increase, Biden stated, \u201cwhen Medicare was passed, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans didn\u2019t have more than five times the wealth of the bottom 50 percent combined, and it only makes sense that some adjustments be made to reflect that reality today.\u201dCounterargument:The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board deemed the proposal a \u201chuge tax increase paired with prescription-drug rationing that does nothing to reform the health entitlement.\u201d The piece argues the proposed legislation shows \u201chow destructive taxes inevitably expand\u201d and determines the end game for giving Medicare more negotiating power is to \u201ccontrol the prices and access to all pharmaceutical treatments.\u201d The piece concludes the bill has no chance of passing and exists \u201cmainly to bludgeon Republicans as wanting to push seniors off their retirement ice floes.\u201d",
