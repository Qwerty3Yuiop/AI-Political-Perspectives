    "headline": "Trumps Controversial Immigration Ad Incorrectly Blames Democrats Illegal Immigrants Rampage",
    "summary": "President Trump's new midterms ad on immigration sparked controversy this week over allegations of racism, with many pointing out it incorrectly blames Democrats for allowing Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant who was eventually convicted of murdering two sheriff's deputies, back into the country. He was readmitted to the U.S. while President George W. Bush was in office. Some have also said that Democrats are too eager to push back on Trump's immigration rhetoric, and by doing so, they reinforce the misconception that the party wants open borders.",
