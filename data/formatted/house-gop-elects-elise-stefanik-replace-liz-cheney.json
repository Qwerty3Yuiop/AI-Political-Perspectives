    "headline": "House Gop Elects Elise Stefanik Replace Liz Cheney",
    "summary": "Two days after theyvoted to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.)as GOP Conference Chair,  House Republicans elected Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) to fill the position. The contrast between Stefanik\u2019s support for former President Donald Trump and Cheney\u2019s outspoken opposition to Trump\u2019s false election fraud claims marks a political shift for Republicans. Stefanik was challenged for the role by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who opposed Stefanik\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d positions and gained 46 votes against Stefanik\u2019s 134.In a statement posted to Twitter, Stefanik said, \u201cHouse Republicans are united in our focus to fight on behalf of the American people to save our country from the radical Socialist Democrat agenda of President Biden and Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nCoverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to contain analysis of what Stefanik\u2019s role would mean for the Republican party moving forward. Some coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted quotes from Republican leaders congratulating Stefanik.",
