    "summary": "A string of recent attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen on commercial and naval vessels in the Red Sea is sparking concern over the U.S. Navy\u2019s ability to protect global trade.For Context:Since the start of Israel\u2019s recent fighting against Hamas fighters in Gaza, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have been attacking ships passing through the Red Sea.\u201c19th Century Backup Plan\u201d:A writer inBloomberg (Lean Left bias)dismissed fears that the attacks posed a threat to the global economy. The writer outlined the numerous shutdowns the canal has faced since opening in 1869. Each time, shipping has rerouted around Africa. The writer concluded, \u201cThe Suez should still be used, when it\u2019s safe, as the time and cost savings are of great benefit. But knowing there\u2019s a 19th century backup plan is enough assurance that the global economy won\u2019t crash at the next sign of mayhem.\u201dNaval Deterioration:In theWall Street Journal Opinion (Lean Right bias), a retired U.S. Navy captain attributed the attacks to a deterioration of the U.S. Navy. A declining fleet of ships in the Navy, plus a global perception that Americans are disinterested in fighting, \u201cmight explain Iran\u2019s boldness in the face of U.S. naval patrols.\u201d The retired captain called on Congress to increase the budget of the Navy, warning, \u201cFailure to do so imperils global trade as well as America\u2019s place in the world and the safety of its people.\u201d",
