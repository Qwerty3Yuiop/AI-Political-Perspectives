    "summary": "U.S. Special Envoy for Haiti Daniel Foote resigned Thursday to protest what he called \u201cinhumane\u201d deportations of\u00a0asylum-seeking Haitian migrants to Haiti. Many of the migrants in questiondid not come directly from Haiti, but instead lived in Central and South American countries for years before coming to the U.S. Additionally, Haiti is recovering from a devastating Augustearthquakethat killed 2,200 people andimpacted 800,000. In his resignation letter, Foote said: \u201cI will not be associated with the United States\u00a0inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs to daily life.\u201d State Department spokesman Ned Price criticized Foote, who was appointed in late July 2021, saying he had \u201cresigned and mischaracterized\u201d the situation instead of \u201cparticipating in a solutions-oriented policy process.\u201dCoverage was prominently featured across the spectrum on Thursday. Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides, with a few exceptions; while most headlines called Foote a \u201cU.S.\u201d diplomat, for instance,Fox News\u2019headline said he was \u201cBiden's.\u201d Some left-rated outlets likeCNNframed the resignation as a protest of \u201cU.S. policy\u201d on an issue the Biden administration was \u201cgrappling with.\u201d",
