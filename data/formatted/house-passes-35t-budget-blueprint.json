    "summary": "On Tuesday night, the\u00a0House of Representatives passed the blueprint for a $3.5 trillion budget plan. The rule proposed to proceed with the plan passed with a 220 to 212 vote; all Democrats voted in favor, and all Republicans opposed it. House leadership also struck a deal with moderate Democrats on a path towards voting on the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in late September.If the budget resolution is adopted\u00a0by the House, the Democrats could\u00a0use a process called budget reconciliation to employ\u00a0a simple majority to pass the legislation without any Republican support.",
