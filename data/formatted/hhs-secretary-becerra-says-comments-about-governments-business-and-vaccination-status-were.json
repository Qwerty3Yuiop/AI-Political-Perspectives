    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra sparked\u00a0controversy on Thursday afteran interview with CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar. Keilar asked, \u201cI wonder if you can answer that criticism: \u2018It\u2019s none of the government\u2019s business knowing who has or hasn\u2019t been vaccinated.\u2019 What do you say?\u201d Becerra responded, \u201cIt is absolutely the government\u2019s business, it is taxpayers\u2019 business, if we have to continue to spend money to try to keep people from contracting covid and helping reopen the economy.\u201dBecerra later tweetedthat his comments were \u201ctaken wildly out of context\u201d and that the \u201cgovernment has no database tracking who is vaccinated.\u201dCoverage was more prominent in right-rated outlets, with Fox News featuring the story at the top of its homepage. Coverage in several outlets across the spectrum took Becerra\u2019s comments to mean that it was the government\u2019s business to know who had been vaccinated. Coverage in some left-rated outlets highlighted Becerra\u2019s claim that his\u00a0remarks were taken out of context.",
