    "summary": "Monday is the 22nd anniversary of theSeptember 11th terror attacks, drawing widespread media coverage across the spectrum.A National Holiday?:An opinion forNew York Daily News (Left bias)argued that 9/11 should be made into a national holiday. It said since many young adults today are not old enough to remember the attacks, a day of significance would help enshrine 9/11\u2019s legacy. The piece angled itself from a place of national unity, saying, \u201cThe unity felt on this one day each year transcends all boundaries.\u201dIn The Classroom:A report fromThe Hill (Center bias)included perspectives from several teachers across America on how 9/11 is a part of their classrooms. It reported that 9/11\u2019s legacy is stronger on the East Coast, and while teachers further west may viscerally grasp the day\u2019s significance, students are less likely to fully understand it. One teacher likened today\u2019s youth learning about 9/11 to his own school experience when learning about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Post-9/11 Politicians:An opinion forNational Review (Right bias)made note of the large amount of significant Republican and Democrat politicians currently in office that have post-9/11 military experience. The piece briefly examines American military involvements of the past, and how 9/11 and the War on Terror have shaped the American political landscape to date. The writer says it\u2019s impossible to generalize this diverse group of leaders, yet hopes they\u2019ve \u201clearned the right lessons.\u201d",
