    "headline": "Supreme Court Supreme Court Declines Rule Trump Immunity Argument",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court declined the request from Special Counsel Jack Smith to issue a judgment on former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that he is immune from prosecution over his actions in the aftermath of the 2020 election.For Context:In August, the Department of Justicecharged Trump with four crimesin connection with the 2020 election and the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump\u2019s legal team attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing that Trump has legal immunity for his actions as president during the election. The federal judge overseeing the case denied this motion. Trump\u2019s team appealed the decision, and Smith requested the United States Supreme Court to intervene, bypassing the federal appeals court.Details:In asking the Supreme Court to intervene in the case before the federal appeals court, Smith made whatCNN (Lean Left bias)labeled an \u201cextraordinary gamble.\u201d Smith argued that waiting for the appeals court to rule on the case would delay the trial's scheduled March start date,writing, \u201cthe resolution of the question presented is pivotal to whether the former President himself will stand trial \u2013 which is scheduled to begin less than three months in the future.\u201d Trump's legal team argued that Smith\u2019s appeal to bypass the appeals court was disingenuous. Outlets across the spectrum are predicting that the decision will most likely delay the trail\u2019s start date.How the Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum covered the decision prominently on Friday but mainly offered analysis since few details were released by the court.",
