    "headline": "Npr Report Donald Trump Jr Draws Scrutiny",
    "summary": "A report published by NPR claiming that Donald Trump Jr. lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 and contradicted Michael Cohen's recent account of real estate efforts in Russia has drawn scrutiny from some right-leaning sources for being misleading, as the article eliminates a portion of the transcript where Trump Jr. admits that then-candidate Trump was pursuing a project in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.",
