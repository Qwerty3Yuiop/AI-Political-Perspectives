    "summary": "Rudy\u00a0Giuliani has been called on to testify before a\u00a0special grand jury in Georgiainvestigating\u00a0efforts by former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0and his supporters tooverturn the 2020 election.Giuliani\u2019s lawyers on Monday revealed that\u00a0an Atlanta prosecutor labeled him an official \"target\"of the criminal probe.\u00a0Giuliani, who previously served as Trump's personal lawyer, is seen as a prominent leader\u00a0of the pro-Trump\u00a0legal team thathighlighted alleged claims of voter fraudand\u00a0filed numerous lawsuits to block election results from battleground\u00a0states.\u00a0Giuliani's attorney Robert Costello said that people are \"delusional\" if they believe Giuliani\u00a0will reveal details of his private conversations with Trump. While\u00a0Giuliani attempted to avoid travel by citing a recent heart stent procedure, he is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to testify\u00a0in Atlanta on Wednesday.In response to the\u00a0efforts of Giuliani and his legal team,a group of bipartisan senators\u00a0introduced legislation last month thatwould\u00a0increase the number of Congress members required to object election results. The\u00a0January 6 committee investigating the Capitol riot is also attempting to\u00a0uncover the \"culmination of an attempted coup\" tooverturn the election.Some reports suggested the probe could be connected totheinvestigation into the handling of classified recordsfound atMar-a-Lago. Other reports highlighted how\u00a0Giuliani has\u00a0been under investigation for three yearswithout being indictedand that President Biden \"boasted\" about readying lawyers to contest voting results leading up to the 2020 election.",
