    "summary": "President Joe Biden apologized after a curt encounter with a CNN reporter at a solo news conference Wednesday following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins asked Biden why he felt so \"confident\" Putin would change his behavior. Biden replied, \"\"I'm not confident he'll change his behavior. What in the hell, what do you do all the time?...I said what will change their behavior is if the rest of the world reacts to them and diminishes their standing in the world.\" After Collins pressed Biden for an answer on why he said he considered the meeting \"constructive,\"\u00a0he replied, \"If you don't understand that, you're in the wrong business,\" before finally walking away. Biden's response garnered wide backlash from reporters on social media.\u00a0Later,Biden addressed reportersbefore boarding a plane and apologized for his exchange with Collins.\u00a0\u201cI apologise for having been short,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cYou never ask positive questions...Look, to be a good reporter, you\u2019ve gotta be negative. You\u2019ve gotta have a negative view of life, it seems to me, the way you all ... you never ask a positive question.\u201dSomecriticized Bidenfor\"demeaning\" behavior toward a female reporter. Some on the right used the incident to draw parallels between Biden's relationship with the media and Trump's relationship with the media; some right voices also highlightedthe fact\u00a0that Biden sometimes\u00a0pre-selects journalists during press conferencesand\"flips out\" when pressed by reporters.
