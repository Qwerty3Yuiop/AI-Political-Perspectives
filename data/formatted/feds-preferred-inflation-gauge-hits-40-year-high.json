Both numbers were higher than economists predicted.Aseparate reportreleased Friday by the Labor Department showed thatemployers spent 5.1% more on compensating workersin the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period a year earlier, which marked the fastest annual pace on records back to 2001.Left- and center-rated sources oftenhighlighted the wage growthmore prominently than right-rated sources did, which instead tended tofocus primarily on high inflation. AWall Street Journal (Center bias)report said the wage increases are \"keeping pressure on historically high inflation.\" A New York Times report said Friday's numbers are \"likely to keep the central bank on track for futurerate increases.\" A Fox Business report said the compensation growth was \"another troubling indication that inflation is broadening throughout the economy.\"",
