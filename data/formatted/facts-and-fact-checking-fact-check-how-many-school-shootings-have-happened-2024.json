    "summary": "Sources that track the \"number of U.S. school shootings\" often use different criteria and\u00a0definitions of \"school shootings,\"\u00a0leading to public confusion about the issues of gun safety, school safety, and violent crime.Different Data:There are two commonly cited sources tracking U.S. \"school shootings.\"The K-12 Violence Project, run by data scientistDavid Riedman, has a \"K-12 School Shooting Database\" counting\u00a0any incident \"when a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time, or day of the week.\"\u00a0This tracker counted 330 school shootings in 2024.EducationWeek (Center bias), a news organization,uses more limited criteriaand counted 39 school shootings in 2024. The K-12 Violence Projectcounted 346 school shootings in 2023, versus 37 countedby EducationWeek.How the Media Covers It:Many sources, especially on the left and center but also some on the right, cite the K-12 Violence Project data when reporting on the \"number of school shootings\" in a given timeframe.The Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)is among the sources thatusethe EducationWeek data.Why the Difference:People on the left are generally in favor of gun restrictions and may gravitate toward data sources that emphasize problems with guns. People on the right are generally less supportive of gun restrictions and may gravitate toward data sources that make gun problems seem less severe.This summary was updated throughout 2024.
