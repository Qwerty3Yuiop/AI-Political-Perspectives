    "summary": "After the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI concluded that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself and there is no \u201cclient list,\u201d many media outlets and prominent voices from both the right and left have remained skeptical - sometimes pointing the finger at each other.MAGA Becomes The \u2018Deep State\u2019:An opinion by Chris Cillizza forThe Daily Beast (Left)took the DOJ and FBI\u2019s conclusions at face value and described Republicans and Trump supporters who were skeptical of the Epstein files over the years as conspiracy theorists. Cillizza argued, \u201cThis is what happens when the dog catches the car. Or, to put a finer point on it, when you and the people around you become the very \u201cDeep State\u201d you have spent years attacking.\u201d\u2018The Left\u2019 Pivots:Scott McKay ofThe Spectator (Right)wrote in an opinion, \u201cThe Left, which is a collection of people with very little interest in Epstein\u2019s pedo ring when it was obvious a bunch of their heroes and financial backers were involved, have now come out of the woodwork to claim that the reason for the demurral by Attorney General Pam Bondi and others is that Trump himself was on the Epstein list.\u201d McKay said he doesn\u2019t believe that to be the case because the Democrats would have used it for political leverage in 2016 instead of the \u201cidiotic\u201d Steele dossier, and that \u201cTrump and his people now recognize\u2026 the amount of collateral damage you get from outing Mossad in the Epstein case quickly becomes more than anybody can bear.\u201dCommon Ground:Prominent influencers and journalists have also expressed skepticism toward the DOJ and FBI\u2019s conclusions.Tucker Carlson (Right), in a podcast episode where he spoke with Breaking Points hostSaagar Enjeti (Center),said, \u201cThe current DOJ under Pam Bondi is covering up crimes, very serious crimes by their own description. Why are they doing that?\u201dCenk Uygur (Left)wrote, \u201cI agree with Tucker Carlson, that it's strange that the neocon crowd, like Mark Levin, are very quiet about the Epstein files. They don't seem as outraged as the rest of Trump voters.\u201dGlenn Greenwald (Center)said, of President Trump\u2019s downplaying of the Epstein skepticism, \u201cHow anyone who is a Trump supporter can listen to that and not feel completely condescended to and devalued and ignored is something I\u2019ll never understand.\u201dWritten by the AllSides staff (of humans).Learn more.Support our mission.",
