    "summary": "When Facebook, Instagram and WhatsAppshut down for most of Monday, the consequences were felt across the globe.The outage obstructed many social media users in the U.S. from their favorite form of entertainment but had much more serious implications elsewhere. Facebook says it\u00a0has 3 billion users worldwide; it\u00a0is\u00a0used internationally\u00a0as an information hub\u00a0by many governments, healthcare networks, school systems and other public service entities. WhatsApp, a communication app\u00a0with\u00a02 billion users\u00a0across over 180 countries, is similarly essential to basic communication, information sharing and business in other countries. Since the apps enable free communication between anyone with a WiFi signal, they are especially popular in Latin America and other regions where a lack of business competition makes mobile phone costs extremely high.The shutdown's worldwide impact was covered by left- and center-rated news sources, which often highlighted how the outage impacted business, healthcare, government operations and basic communication. Few right-rated news outlets, if any, offered coverage of or perspectives on the outage's impact beyond North America.",
