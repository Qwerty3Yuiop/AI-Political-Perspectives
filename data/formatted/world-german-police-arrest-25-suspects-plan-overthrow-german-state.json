    "headline": "World German Police Arrest 25 Suspects Plan Overthrow German State",
    "summary": "In a nationwide series of raids on Wednesday, German police arrested 25 suspects in a plot to overthrow the German government by force.Key Quotes: \"The accused are united by a deep rejection of state institutions and the free democratic basic order of the Federal Republic of Germany, which over time has led to their decision to participate in their violent elimination and to engage in concrete preparatory actions for this purpose,\" a statement by the German federal prosecutor's office said.For Context: The right-wing\u00a0group led by Prince Heinrich XIII, known as the Reichsb\u00fcrger Movement, was planning to replace the government with its own order, headed by Heinrich. Wednesday's raids reportedly covered 130 properties belonging to 52 suspects in 11 German states. The movement is a loose alliance of primarily right-wing groups that believe the German constitution prior to World War II was never properly nullified and that the current, reunified Germany is therefore not valid.How the Media Covered it: Sources across the political spectrum prominently covered the arrests, with many noting the history and objectives of the Reich Citizen. Left-rated sources emphasized the group's right-wing views more than right-rated sources did.",
