    "summary": "While speaking to a crowd in front of Warsaw's Royal Castle in Poland on Saturday,President Joe Bidenclosed his speech\u00a0with a bold and\u00a0seemingly unscripted remark that sparked a quick rebuttal fromthe White House.\"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,\" Biden said, referring toRussian President Vladimir Putinandhis ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Biden's comment\u00a0was widely interpreted as a\u00a0call\u00a0for regime change in Russia, but a White House official swiftly clarified after the president's speech that this was not the case.\u00a0\"The president\u2019s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,\"\u00a0the official told reporters.Most reports from across the spectrum emphasized\u00a0that this was the second time the White House has had to \"clean up\" the president's remarks duringhis four-day\u00a0trip to Europe.\u00a0Whilespeaking to U.S. troops in\u00a0Poland on Friday,Biden implied that\u00a0they might be getting deployed to Ukrainewhen saying \"you're gonna\u00a0see when you're there.\"The Washington Post (Lean Left bias)emphasized how some officials saidBiden's comment regarding Putin \"was an honest acknowledgment of reality\"and predicted that his words\u00a0\"almost certainly will be used as part ofRussia\u2019s propaganda.\"Fox News (Right bias)interviewed Russia \"expert\" and\u00a0former Defense Intelligence Agency officer\u00a0Rebekah Koffler, who believes that\u00a0\"Putin heard loud and clear a call for regime change.\"",
