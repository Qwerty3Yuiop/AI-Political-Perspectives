    "summary": "Why did New Yorkerspick Democrat Tom Suozzi over Republican Mazi Pilipto fill the seat left vacant after the House expelled George Santos?Key Quotes:Former President Donald Trump called Pilip a \u201cvery foolish woman\u201d after the election, suggesting she was \u201cstill a Democrat\u201d and lost because \u201cshe didn\u2019t endorse me\u201d and failed to turn out Trump\u2019s supporters.\u2018The issue of immigration fell short\u2019:National Review\u2019s (Opinion rated Right)Jim Geraghty wrote that while \u201cturnout is low,\u201d and \u201cthe electorate is usually not as tuned in as in a November,\u201d the GOP\u2019s \u201cpitch to the suburbs\u201d on immigration failed, and Trump\u2019s wing of the party alienated voters. Geraghty also highlighted a Truth Social post in which Trump wrote, \u201cI WANT TO BE LOVED.\u201d\u2018The blueprint to take down Trump\u2019:A writer inNewsweek (Center bias)labeled Suozzi a \u201ccentrist\u201d whose campaign could be \u201ca blueprint for how the 2024 election could unfold.\u201d Echoing analyses in some other outlets, the Newsweek analysis argued that \u201c abortion, immigration and crime\u201d \u2014 which Suozzi focused on \u2014 \u201care sure to play a key role in the presidential election.\u201d\u2018Your boring-but-stable ex\u2019:Democratic strategist Melissa DeRosa wrote in theDaily Beast (Left bias)that Suozzi\u2019s victory \u201cisn\u2019t quite the bellwether some want it to be,\u201d because conditions were optimal for Democrats. Suozzi previously held the seat, she said, and \u201cDemocrats in New York took back a seat we never should have given up to begin with.\u201d DeRosa also cited Suozzi\u2019s relatively conservative stances on the border.",
