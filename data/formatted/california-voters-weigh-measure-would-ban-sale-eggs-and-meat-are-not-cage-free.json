    "summary": "Californians will weigh in on Proposition 12 during midterm elections, a measure that aims to ban the sale of meat and eggs from animals raised in cages. Supporters have said that the new regulation would ensure animals are treated humanely, while opponents counter that it will cause prices to skyrocket as production costs increase. Several animal rights groups have also opposed the measure, saying it doesn't go far enough.",
