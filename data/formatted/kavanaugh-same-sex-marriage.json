    "headline": "Kavanaugh Same Sex Marriage",
    "summary": "Although Kavanaugh's judicial record has no decisions related to LGBT rights, some have expressed fear that he will vote against the interests of the minority community. During his confirmation hearing, Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris asked if he thought Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, was correctly decided. His refusal to answer the question prompted some to speculate that he will work to reverse the decision, while others noted that it is standard procedures for nominees to abstain from providing their opinions on any given case.",
