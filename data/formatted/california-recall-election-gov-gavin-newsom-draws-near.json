    "summary": "California's upcoming\u00a0special election\u00a0on whether to\u00a0recall\u00a0Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is\u00a0set for Sept. 14. Every California\u00a0voter has been sent a\u00a0ballot at their address for the option to vote by mail, or on election day. More than 50% of voters must vote \"yes\" to the recall for Newsom to be removed.\u00a0The recall effort stems largely fromCalifornians' frustrations with Newsom's\u00a0handling of the COVID-19 pandemicand purportedly overbearing public health edicts. Forty-six candidates signed up to run against Newsom; in\u00a0April, the petition to recall himreached over 1.7 million signatures, meeting the threshold needed to schedule a recall election. Many sources across the spectrum say conservative talk show host Larry Elder is the frontrunning challenger.Coverage in California and around the country has covered the recall effort, Newsom's challengers, and the chances of him being voted out. Some left-rated sources highlighted data on early voting that shows a lead for Newsom; some on the right highlighted how Elder and others are moving to win over groups from whom Newsom needs more support, such as Latinos and young people. Sources across the spectrum have also concentrated Newsom's cash advantage; some on the leftsay that advantage\u00a0might not matter, and some on the right focused on prominent Newsom donors, such asbillionaire George Soros.",
