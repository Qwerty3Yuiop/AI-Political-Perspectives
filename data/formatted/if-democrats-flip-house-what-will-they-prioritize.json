    "headline": "If Democrats Flip House What Will They Prioritize",
    "summary": "With Democrats largely projected to flip the House, perspectives vary on their potential agenda, with some positing they will reform campaign ethics, outlaw gerrymandering, and bolster voting rights, while others say they will prioritize impeachment and increase spending.
