    "summary": "The U.S. Senate approved the framework of the Biden administration's $3.5 trillion budget plan on\u00a0Wednesday morning with a 50-49 vote along party lines.\u00a0The procedural vote allows the Senate to move towards a final vote on the budget.\u00a0The plan now goes to the House, where progressives have refused to vote on the infrastructure bill until the House approves the budget plan. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he hopes the package will pass in mid-September.\u00a0Meanwhile, the final details will be negotiated by a dozen Senate committees, with some Democrats wary of the price tag.Outlets on the left were more likely to praise Biden for his\u00a0\"expansive\" vision.",
