    "summary": "Politicians and commentators in the U.S. and abroad were quick to point fingers after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into separatist-contested regions of eastern Ukraine.Who\u2019s to blame for this crisis? Answers varied widely but generally aligned with each accuser\u2019s prior biases.Conservative commentator Candace Owensblamed NATO for expanding eastward, saying, \u201cWE are at fault.\u201d The governments ofChinaandIranseemed to agree, calling out NATO\u2019s purportedly \u201cprovocative actions.\u201d However,former U.N. ambassador Madeleine Albrightwrote inThe New York Times (Opinion rated Left)that \u201cIf Mr. Putin feels backed into a corner, he has only himself to blame.\u201d The New York TimesEditorial Boardseemed to agree, framing Russia\u2019s claims of NATO aggression as afabricated pretext\u00a0for invasion.Generally, the political right was more likely to place blame onPresident Joe Bidenand NATO; the political left was more likely to blame Putin. The line wasn\u2019t absolute, however; inSlate (Left), author Fred Kaplan partly blamed former President George W. Bush for trying to expand NATO, andThe Dispatch (Lean Right)editorJonah Goldbergcalled Putin \u201cthe primary driver of the Ukraine crisis.\u201d",
