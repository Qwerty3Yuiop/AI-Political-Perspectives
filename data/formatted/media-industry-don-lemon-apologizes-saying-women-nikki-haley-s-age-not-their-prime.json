I think it\u2019s the wrong road to go down. She says people, you know, politicians or something are not in their prime. Nikki Haley isn\u2019t in her prime. Sorry. A woman is considered to be in their prime in 20s and 30s and maybe 40s.\u201d When CNN This Morning co-host Poppy Harlow pushed back, Lemon deferred to Google, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying I agree with that.\u201dThe Response:Lemon\u2019s remarks were widely criticized. In a fundraising email, Haley wrote, \u201cBTW it\u2019s always the liberals who are the most sexist.\u201d CNN chairman Chris Licht reportedly called Lemon\u2019s words \u201cupsetting, unacceptable, and unfair to his co-hosts\u201d in a Friday morning editorial call.
