    "summary": "New classified intelligence has reportedly led the Energy Department (DOE) to conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic most likely began witha leak from a laboratory in China.The Details:The Wall Street Journal reported that \"according to a classified intelligence report,\" the DOE shifted its stance and now joins the FBI in believing COVID-19 most likely leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The New York Times (Lean Left bias)publisheda similar report.\u00a0The articles\u00a0say\u00a0the DOE and other agencies agree that the virus wasn't part of a Chinese biological weapons program.For Context:The FBI believes the theory with \"moderate confidence,\"\u00a0and the DOE holds \"low confidence,\" while the National Intelligence Council supports thenatural animal-to-human transmissionorigin theory. Other agencies, including the CIA, remain undecided.\u00a0The Wuhan lab has been scrutinized\u00a0since the pandemic began, particularly over concerns about loose safety protocols andU.S.-funded \"gain of function\" research. A Senate GOP report in October 2022 said thevirus \"most likely\"leaked from the lab.How the Media Covered It:The news was a top story from sources across the spectrum. Some left-rated sources focused more on the low confidence rating and the fact that other federal agencies disagree with the lab leak theory. Right-rated sources more often highlighted voices who've supported the theory since early in the pandemic, when many mainstream news sourcesdescribed it as a \"debunked conspiracy.\"",
