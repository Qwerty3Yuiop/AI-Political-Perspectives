Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng also called it a \u201cdistraction,\u201d butadded,\u201cWe get it, and we have listened.\u201d The pound returned to around $1.12 on Monday, about the value it held prior to the announcement of the tax plan.Truss\u2019 plan would have abolished the U.K.\u2019s top tax bracket,which taxes income over 150,000 pounds per year at 45% \u2014 even as the U.K. faced nearly10%inflation in the 12 months ending in August.\u00a0The proposal drew criticism from some members of Truss\u2019 own Conservative Party, and the liberal Labour Party criticized Truss\u2019 entire economic agenda, which\u00a0included\u00a0othertax cuts.Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Monday,particularly in business-focused outlets, often describing the reversal as a \u201cdramatic about-face.\u201d Several outlets described the reversal as shameful for the U.K. government; theFinancial Times (Center bias)called it\u201cembarrassing,\u201dand several headlines\u00a0called it\u201chumiliating.\u201d",
