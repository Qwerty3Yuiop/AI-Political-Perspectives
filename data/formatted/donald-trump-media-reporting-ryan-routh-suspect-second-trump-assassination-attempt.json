In 2002, he reportedly\u00a0barricaded himself in an office during a three-hour standoff following a traffic stop.\u00a0It appears RouthsupportedTrump in 2016, but in 2020 donated to multiple Democrats.\u00a0Facebook and X\u00a0suspended Routh\u2019s accounts, preventing people from seeing his previous posts.Pro-Ukraine Stances:Routh has\u00a0expressed staunch support for Ukraine. In April, he reportedly expressed a desire to kill Russian President Vladimir Putin in a post directed at Elon Musk on X. In 2022, Routh ostensibly appeared in apromotional videofor Ukraine\u2019s far-right Azov Brigade, which notably has ties to Nazism. Lean Left outletsSemaforandThe New York Timespreviously interviewed Routh about his Ukraine support.\u00a0Ukraine's international legionsaidit had nothing to do with Routh, while a Kremlin spokesmansaid, \"playing with fire has its consequences.\"How The Media Covered It:The story is still developing.\u00a0The Times stopped short of confirming Routh\u2019s alleged 2002 run-in with officials, writing that \u201ca man with the same name and similar age\u201d was arrested.Fox News (Right bias)and others on the right\u00a0framed much of their coverage around Routh's\u00a0prior offenses.",
