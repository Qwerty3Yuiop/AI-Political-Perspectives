    "summary": "In a 6-3 decision,the Supreme Court on Friday overruled a federal ban on bump stocks \u2014 devices that \u201callowa shooter of asemiautomatic firearmto initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.\u201dFor Context:The \u201cban\u201d functioned by clarifying that the definition of \u201cmachinegun\u201d in the Gun Control Act (GCA) and National Firearms Act (NFA) included bump stocks. Former President Donald Trump backed the ban after a shooter used rifles equipped with bump stocks to kill 58 people and injure hundreds\u00a0at a music festival in Las Vegas, NV in 2017.Majority Opinion:Writing for court\u2019s conservative majority, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, \u201cWe hold that a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a \u2018machinegun\u2019 because it cannot fire more than one shot \u2018by a single function of the trigger.\u2019\u201d In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that \u201cCongress can amend the law\u201d if it wished to ban bump stocks.Dissenting Opinion:In a dissenting opinion joined by the other two liberal justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the majority was using a definition of \u201cmachinegun\u201d that \u201cis inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory text and unsupported by context or purpose,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:Coverage was common and initially similar across the spectrum Friday morning.",
