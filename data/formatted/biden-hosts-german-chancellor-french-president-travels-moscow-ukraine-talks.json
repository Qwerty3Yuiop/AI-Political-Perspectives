    "summary": "World leaders held more in-person talks on the Ukraine crisis Monday amid a Russian military build-up along the Ukrainian border.French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to\u00a0Moscow to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to\u00a0Washington, D.C. tostrategize with President Joe Biden; voices across the spectrum have addressedGermany's reluctance to offer military support in the crisis. U.S. intelligence suggests that Putin has assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons\u00a0needed for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine along the border. Russia\u00a0remains adamant that it doesn't intend to invade, and Putin has criticized\u00a0the U.S. and other NATO countries for purportedlyignoring Russian security concerns and demandspertaining to Ukraine.Sources across the spectrum highlighted Monday's meeting between Biden and Scholz in the context of ongoing questions about Germany's role in the crisis and its dependence on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a planned project to transmit\u00a0Russian natural gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Some reports from left-rated outlets framed Macron's meeting with Putin as productive; some coverage from right-rated outlets framed Putin as uninterested in a solution.",
