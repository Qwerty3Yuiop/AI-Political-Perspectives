    "summary": "About 7.5\u00a0million jobless Americanslost their COVID-19 pandemic-era\u00a0unemployment boost of $300 per week onLabor Day \u2014 a holiday that has solicited\u00a0different interpretations from across the spectrum.The jobless were initially granted $600 a week from April to July 2020, butCongress and the Trump administration reduced the payment\u00a0to $300 when reviving the program in December. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,there are currently a record number of job openings, though hiring shortages persist across some industries; some research suggests that unemployed people who lose benefitsmight have a harder time finding a job. If the\u00a0Biden administration's$3.5 trillion federal budget planis passed, many social safety net programs would likely be expanded.Center- and left-rated sources covered the news more prominently, many of which\u00a0framed the cutoff as harmful for the unemployed and described it as the \"most abrupt\" end to government aid in U.S. history.\u00a0Some alsopointed outhow the Biden administration saidstates can redirect other federal funds to extend jobless benefits, yet no states have taken action to do so. Left-rated\u00a0voices often\u00a0took the stance that the act will\u00a0\"reduce spending\" and \"increase poverty,\" while\u00a0highlighting\u00a0families who were\"left scrambling\"and\u00a0\"remain vulnerable.\" Right-rated\u00a0voices were more likely to see the termination\u00a0of the pandemic unemployment benefits as a win for small businesses, and argued\u00a0that purportedly lucrative\u00a0payments caused people to stay home rather than getting a job.",
