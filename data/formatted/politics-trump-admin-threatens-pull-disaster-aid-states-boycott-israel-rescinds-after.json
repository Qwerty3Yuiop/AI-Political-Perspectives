    "summary": "The Trump administration announced on Friday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would deny federal disaster aid to states that boycotted Israeli firms, though it has nowrescindedthe conditions.The Details:FEMA said states must follow \u201cterms and conditions\u201d that require they wouldn\u2019t cut \u201ccommercial relations specifically with Israeli companies\u201d to qualify for funding. The terms applied to at least $1.9 billion allotted for rescue equipment, emergency salaries, and backup power systems, among other things, according to documents reviewed byReuters (Center bias), which first reported the news on Monday. Later on Monday, however,Just The News (Lean Right)reported the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)updated the noticesto no longer include the conditions.DHS Update:The DHSwroteon Monday evening, \u201cThere is NO FEMA requirement tied to Israel in any current NOFO. No states have lost funding, and no new conditions have been imposed. FEMA grants remain governed by existing law and policy and not political litmus tests. DHS will enforce all anti-discrimination laws and policies, including as it relates to the BDS movement, which is expressly grounded in antisemitism. Those who engage in racial discrimination should not receive a single dollar of federal funding.\u201dSaagar Enjeti (Center)reported, \u201cOk after speaking w/ folks here's whats going on: An original guidance from DHS explicitly stated that federal disaster funding was barred from states that allowed boycott of Israel. The WH changed this explicit language after widespread outcry BUT the DHS tweet makes it clear the admin reserves the right to deny these funds on BDS grounds based on the Anti-Boycott Act.\u201dCriticisms:When the news first broke on Monday, several commentators across the spectrum condemned the initial policy change.Matt Walsh (Right)wrote, \u201cThere is just no way to reasonably claim that this qualifies as \u2018America First.\u2019\u201dCenk Uygur (Left)wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely humiliating for America to be controlled by a foreign country like this.\u201dGlenn Greenwald (Center)wrote, \u201cThe Trump Admin -- yet again -- prioritizes the foreign country they revere over the interests of American citizens.\u201dWritten by the AllSides staff (of humans).Learn more.Support our mission.",
