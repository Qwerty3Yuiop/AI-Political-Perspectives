    "summary": "Will the Supreme Court agree that former President Donald Trump has presidential immunity from his federal charges?For Context:On Wednesday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments regarding Trump\u2019s claim that he has presidential immunity from thefederal charges he faces pertaining to the 2020 election. The court is expected to hear arguments in late April.How Will They Rule?Across the spectrum, outlets are predicting that the Justices rule against Trump and deny his immunity argument.Newsweek (Center bias)quoted Greg Germain, a law professor at Syracuse University in New York, stating, \u201cIt's an interesting legal issue when phrased in the abstract, because a president should certainly be immune from criminal prosecution for some core official acts, but not for acts done for personal gain or unconnected with the president's official duties. The president should be immune from wartime decisions, for example.\u201dHow Will It Impact the DOJ Case?Until the Supreme Court hears arguments and issues a ruling, the Justice Department\u2019s case against Trump is halted. The trial was slated to begin in March, but it will most likely be delayed until at least the summer, assuming the Justices do not rule that Trump has immunity from the charges. Some outlets are speculating that the delay will push the trial past the November presidential election.How the Media Covered It:Outlets across the spectrum deemed this development a win for Trump, determining that his strategy in his legal proceedings has been to delay past the election.",
