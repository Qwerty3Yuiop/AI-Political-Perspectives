    "summary": "Thousands of fake Twitter accounts are praising former President Donald Trump and criticizingFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantisandformer U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, an Israeli tech firm said.The Details:The firm, Cyabra, told theAssociated Press (Lean Left bias)that it did not know who created the network of bots, but they were likely created within the U.S.\u00a0in the last 11 months. The bots were reportedly discovered by identifying patterns in account pages, follower lists, and posts.For Context:Haley and DeSantis are two high-profile alternatives to Trump in the2024 Republican presidential primary. DeSantis polls higher than other challengers but has not announced his candidacy, while Haley has announced her campaign and receives about as much support as former Vice President Mike Pence. The bots\u2019 presence echoes the prevalence of fake accounts in 2016 and 2020,\u00a0whenRussia and others attempted\u00a0to influence U.S. voters online.How the Media Covered It:Coverage somewhat sparse across the spectrum and\u00a0largely focused\u00a0on AP\u2019s report. Some coverage differed on the political impact of bots. While AP said bots \u201cremain a potent force in shaping online political discussion,\u201d and theNew York Post (Lean Right bias)said Russian hackers \u201cperfected\u201d social media algorithm manipulation in 2016,National Review (Right bias)noted a recent study which found that Russia\u2019s 2016 efforts \u201chad no measurable impact in changing minds or influencing voter behavior.\u201d",
