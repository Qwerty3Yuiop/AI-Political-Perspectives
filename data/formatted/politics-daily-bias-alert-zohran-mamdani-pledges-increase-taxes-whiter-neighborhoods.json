    "summary": "Democratic socialist New York City mayoral candidateZohran Mamdanihas pledged to increase taxes on \u201cricher and whiter neighborhoods,\u201d which outlets from the right and center have highlighted, while outlets from the left have largely ignored it.The Details:In acampaign promotion sheet, Mamdani pledged to \u201cShift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods.\u201d Mamdani stood by his proposal in a TVinterviewwithNBC News\u2019 (Lean Left)Meet The Press, when he said, \u201cThat is just a description of what we see right now. It\u2019s not driven by race. It\u2019s more of an assessment of what neighborhoods are being under-taxed versus over-taxed,\u201dFor Context:Mamdanidefeatedformer New York Governor Chris Cuomo in the Democratic primary last week \u2013 a result media across the spectrum described as \u201cstunning.\u201d Mamdaniwonneighborhoods with higher median household incomes, young people, and the Asian vote, while Cuomo won lower-income neighborhoods, 55+ voters, and the black vote. Mamdani will run against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who was a Democrat but recently switchedto an Independent, as well as\u00a0Cuomo (now in the Fight and Deliver party) and Republican Curtis Sliwa.How The Media Covered It:Several outlets from the right and center, such asBBC (Center),The Hill (Center),The New York Post (Lean Right),Newsweek (Center), andThe Washington Examiner (Lean Right)have highlighted Mamdani\u2019s pledge about \u201cwhiter\u201d neighborhoods. Outside of the television coverage from NBC, where the interviewer questioned Mamdani on it, AllSides did not find an outlet from the left that mentioned the \u201cwhiter\u201d phrasing. For instance,NPR (Lean Left)interviewed Mamdani on July 1 but didn\u2019t mention it in coverage or ask about it.Written by the AllSides staff (of humans).Learn more.Support our mission.",
