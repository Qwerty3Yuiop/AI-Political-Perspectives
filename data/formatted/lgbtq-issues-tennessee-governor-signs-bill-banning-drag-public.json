    "summary": "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) signed a law effectively banning drag performances in public.The Details:The bill,Senate Bill 3, bans \u201cadult cabaret performances\u201d anywhere they \u201ccould be viewed by a person who is not an adult.\u201d The bill\u2019s definition of \u201cadult cabaret performance\u201d includes both sexual performers and \u201cmale or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest, or similar entertainers, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration.\u201d Lee also signed a bill banning gender transition care for trans minors.For Context:The political right focused more on drag queens as a\u201cculture war\u201dissue in 2022, with right-wing media personalities and lawmakers\u00a0asserting they were sexual in nature, and therefore inappropriate for children. Some of this attention focused on drag queen story hours, in which\u00a0drag queens read\u00a0books to children at libraries. Members of theProud Boyshave protested outside drag events\u00a0on multiple occasions, including as recently as last month.The Twist:Lee himself reportedly dressed in women\u2019s clothing in a high school yearbook photo. When asked about it, Lee said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to conflate \u201csomething like that to sexualized entertainment in front of children.\u201dHow the Media Covered It:Coverage was far more common on the left than on the right. While some left-rated sources called the bill \u201canti-drag,\u201d aDaily Wire (Right bias)news update referred to it as \u201cpro-child.\u201d LGBTQ outlets were particularly opposed to the bill, with one headline accusing Lee of a \u201ccruel attack\u201d on LGBTQ people and drag queens.",
