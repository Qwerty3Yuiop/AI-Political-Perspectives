    "headline": "Politics Senate Passes Foreign Aid Bill",
    "summary": "The Senate passed a $95 billion bipartisan foreign aid bill early Tuesday morning that would\u00a0provide supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.Key Details: The package passed by a 70-29 vote. Twenty-two\u00a0Republicans supported it, and two Democrats, Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and\u00a0Peter Welch (D-VT),\u00a0opposed the bill, as did Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA)\u00a0indicated that he will not bring the vote to the floor of the House in its present form.Key Quotes:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been years, perhaps decades, since the\u00a0Senate\u00a0has passed a bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, not just the security of our allies, but also the security of western democracy,\u201d said\u00a0Senate\u00a0Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said,\u00a0\u201cThe Senate understands the responsibilities of America\u2019s national security and will not neglect them. History settles every account. And today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink.\u201dFor Context: The proceedings have taken place amid ariftbetween the GOP establishment and some House Republicans with\u00a0more isolationist views.How the Media Covered it: Sources across the political spectrum noted the rarity of an all-night session in the Senate \u2014\u00a0a session that saw a number of Republican Senators speak out against the legislation, wanting a focus on border security\u00a0to be included in the bill. Many sources also noted the difficulty of the bill passing in the House, where it is headed next.",
