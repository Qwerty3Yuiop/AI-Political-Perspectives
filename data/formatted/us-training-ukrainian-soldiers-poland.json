    "summary": "President Joe Biden's remark that U.S. troops stationed in Poland are\u00a0training Ukrainian forces to defend againstRussia's invasionwas contradicted\u00a0by other U.S. officials. So, what's actually happening?On Monday, Bidenimplied that he talked to U.S. troops\"about helping train the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland.\"\u00a0On Tuesday, a\u00a0Pentagon spokesperson said U.S. troops were \"liasing\" with Ukrainian forces in Poland, but \"not training in the classic sense that many people think of training.\" The\u00a0head of U.S. European Command also said he doesn't believe \"we are in the process of currently training military forces from Ukraine in Poland.\" When asked about the comment, the White House communications director said she couldn't add further detail, \"except to say that there is regular interaction\" between U.S. and Ukrainian troops. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suggested later Monday that Biden may have revealed \"classified secrets on national television.\"Right-rated sources, and some on the left like\u00a0Politico (Lean Left bias), oftenframed Biden's remark as a gaffe. Some on the right wondered if Biden was misinformed, misspoke, or if he revealed a military secret, and argued that any of those would be evidence of dysfunction\u00a0andBiden's inability to navigate the conflict. One report from CNN moved to clarify Biden's comment, and focused on anonymous sources who said that U.S.\u00a0troops in Poland are\u00a0instructing Ukrainians on how to use weapons that the West sent to\u00a0Ukraine.",
