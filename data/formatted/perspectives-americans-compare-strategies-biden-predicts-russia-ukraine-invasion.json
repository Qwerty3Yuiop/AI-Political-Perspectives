    "summary": "President Joe Biden said this week that he believes Russia will invade Ukraine astensions continue to growbetween the two nations.While Biden originally stated that a \"minor incursion\"\u00a0would elicit\u00a0a different response from the U.S. than a full-on invasion, his administration spent the last few days \"cleaning up that remark\" and said\u00a0\"Russia will pay a heavy price\" if any\u00a0troops enter Ukraine. Russia hascontinued to bolster\u00a0its military presenceon the Ukraine border amid weeks of diplomatic talks with the U.S. and NATO, which Moscow's lead negotiator said hit a \"dead end.\"Left-rated voices were more likely to emphasize thatplacing more economic sanctions on Russiawould be more efficient than sending defensive troops into Ukraine.CNN (Left bias)noted that a Russia-Ukraine invasion could cause \"gas prices to soar\" and lead to\u00a0\"the biggest clash of regular conventional armies in Europe since World War II.\"The New York Times editorial board\u00a0(Left bias)wrote that \"invading Ukraine isn\u2019t worth the price\" for Russia as it would raise tensions with the U.S. \"to dangerous levels\" and bring\u00a0\"untold misery down on the Russian economy.\" Right-rated voices were more likely to believe that the U.S. needs to strengthen its military presence in order to assure protection from Russia's armed forces.National Review (Right bias)wrote that the U.S. Navy and NATO \"need more attack submarines\" in the Atlantic before Europe becomes\u00a0a continent the White House\u00a0\"cannot reach or aid.\"",
