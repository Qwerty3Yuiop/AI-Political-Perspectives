Will he make the trip?White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said last week that the administration is \"not currently planning a trip by the President of the United States to Ukraine.\" During avisit to Polandlast month, Biden said that \"they will not let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what's going on in Ukraine.\" The White House had said before the trip that a potential visit to Ukraine hadn't been explored. In aninterviewwith CNN that aired Sunday, Zelesnkyy said\u00a0\"I think [Biden's] the leader of the United States and that's why he should come here to see,\" and predicted that Biden would eventually make the trip.Some sources across the media spectrum framed a potential visit by Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris as unlikely. Coverage from left-rated sources sometimes highlighted Zelenskyy's prediction that Biden would eventually go to Ukraine. Some reports from right-rated sources painted Zelesnkyy's comments as a challenge to Biden.",
