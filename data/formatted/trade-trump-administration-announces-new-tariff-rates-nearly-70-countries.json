    "headline": "Trade Trump Administration Announces New Tariff Rates Nearly 70 Countries",
    "summary": "Followingmonths of negotiations, the White House has released a revised list of tariff rates for nearly 70 countries, set to take effect on August 7.The Details:Thenew tariff ratesvary considerably. Notable rates include 15% for Iceland and Israel, 30% for South Africa, 39% for Switzerland, and 20% for Taiwan and Vietnam. However, Brazil's rate, although listed at 10%, is expected toincrease to 50%. Canada, also not listed, is expected toincur a 35% tariff, reportedly due to President Donald Trump\u2019s concerns over illicit drugs crossing the northern border and Canada\u2019s announcement that it willrecognize a Palestinian state. \u00a0Not all countries have managed to reach a trade agreement with the US, and those not listed in the announcement will be subject to a 10% tariff.For Context:The announcement of these new rates comes after afour-month-long negotiation processbetween the US and its trading partners. The goal of these negotiations was tolock in one-for-one agreements, some of which are reflected in the new list. Some US businesses have pushed back, as arguments for and against Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs arebeing heard in the US Court of Appeals.How the Media Covered It:TheNew York Post (Lean Right bias)highlighted Brazil's increased rate and the one-for-one agreements that the White House sought to lock in.The Washington Times (Lean Right)focused on thecountries that didn't offer a satisfactory dealduring negotiations and the fact that the new levies won't take effect until a week after the initial August 1 deadline.The Guardian (Left)provided a comprehensive list of all the countries and their respective tariff rates.\u00a0Coverage fromReuters (Center)was brief and focused on the rates for India, Taiwan, and South Africa.Revised by the AllSides staff (of humans) after a first draft from our custom AI.Learn more.Support our mission.Suggest an improvement to this summary.",
