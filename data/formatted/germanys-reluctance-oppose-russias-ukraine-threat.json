    "summary": "News coverage\u00a0across the political spectrum is pointing out how Germany isn't joining the U.S. and its European allies in opposition toRussia's military buildup on the Ukrainian border.The U.S. and other nations from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union are preparing troops and sending weapons to Ukraine in response toRussia's possible invasion of the country. Germany's reaction has been different, as it reportedly blocked\u00a0Estonia from transferring German-origin military equipment to Ukraine. New\u00a0German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said over the weekend that there \"would be a high price\"\u00a0for a Russian incursion into Ukraine and said Germany \"will jointly act\" with allies. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s navy chief resigned\u00a0after saying\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin probably deserves \"respect.\"Voices and analysts across the spectrum, from NBC News and theNew York Times (Lean Left bias)to National Review andWall Street Journal's opinion section (Lean Right), were united inhighlightingGermany's hesitanceto challenge Russia, with many describing it as the possible \"weak link\" in the conflict.\u00a0Right-rated voices were often more critical of Germany and suggested thatNord Stream 2, a gas pipeline direct from Russia to Germany that's expected to move roughly 55 billion cubic meters of gas each year, is a significant conflict of interest that Putin will try to capitalize on. Some left- and center-rated sources focused on Germany's militarization during 20th-century wars as a potential reason for its current reluctance to play a role in a potential armed conflict.",
