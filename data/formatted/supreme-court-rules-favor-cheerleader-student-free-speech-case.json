    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 on Wednesdaythat a Pennsylvania school district violated the First Amendment by suspending a cheerleader, Brandi Levy, from the junior varsity team for a\u00a0year over a profanity-laden Snapchat rant. Public schools can still regulate some off-campus speech, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, adding, \u201cCircumstances that may implicate a school\u2019s regulatory interests include serious or severe bullying or harassment targeting particular individuals; threats aimed at teachers or other students; the failure to follow rules concerning lessons, the writing of papers, the use of computers, or participation in other online school activities; and breaches of school security devices.\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the court's decision ignored precedent and that Levy's rant could have harmed the school's athletic program.Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides. Some coverage pointed to different\u00a0arguments from Justice Thomas' dissent. Some right-rated outlets likeWashington Examinerinstead featured\u00a0Wednesday's other Supreme Court rulings, includinglimiting police ability to conduct warrantless searchesandstriking down a California ruleallowing labor organizers to visit farm laborers in fields.",
