    "summary": "President Joe Biden's recent remarks about handguns and gun laws sparked criticism from fact-checkers and conservative voices.Speaking to reporters at the White HouseMonday after meeting\u00a0with Uvalde shooting victims' families, Biden said that when he visited a New York trauma hospital 20-25 years ago and asked why the death rate had gone up, a trauma doctor told him that \"a 9mm bullet blows the lung out of the body.\" Biden then said there is \"no rational basis\" for owning \"high caliber\" weapons for self-protection or hunting. He also drew a historical comparison, and falsely claimed\u00a0that people couldn't buy\u00a0cannons when the 2nd Amendment was passed. According to Shooting Industry magazine, 9mm pistolsaccounted for 57%of all U.S.-made handguns in 2019. The Beretta M9, a semiautomatic 9mm handgun, is the service pistol\u00a0used by the United States Armed Forces.Right-rated outlets covered Biden remarks prominently. Many framed his characterization of 9mm handguns as misleading; highlighted how 9mm handguns are used widely by civilians; and pointed out how Biden's 2nd Amendment comment had beendeemed false by fact checkersacross the spectrum for concealed carry and self-protection. Some conservative voices and politicians accused Biden of encouraging a ban on handguns similar tothe one recently proposed in Canada.\u00a0Few left-rated outlets covered the remarks. Those that did, such as the Washington Post, didn't offer other context or scrutiny of Biden's remarks about handguns and the 2nd Amendment.",
