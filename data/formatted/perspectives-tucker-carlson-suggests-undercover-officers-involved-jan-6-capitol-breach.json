    "summary": "On Monday, right-rated news outletRevolver Newspublished a story calling for probes into whether the government may have had undercover agents within extremist groups that participated in the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Fox News host Tucker Carlson laterpicked up the story on his Tuesday night show. The argument\u00a0points\u00a0to the indictments of several people\u00a0who were allegedly\u00a0involved in Capitol breach planning. Those indictments allegedly reference\u00a0several\u00a0co-conspirators who\u00a0were not indicted. Carlson speculated the unindicted co-conspirators were not charged\u00a0because those people are undercover law enforcement officers; and,\u00a0if this\u00a0the case, the government would have known about the breach, and\u00a0could have acted to stop the violence, but failed to do so.Some right-rated outlets, along with Fox News,\u00a0picked up Revolver News'\u00a0story. On Wednesday, Twitter\u00a0highlighted the story, saying that \"some people who participated in the attacks were named as 'unindicted co-conspirators'...and according to legal experts, undercover agents cannot be named as unindicted co-conspirators.\"Carlson later respondedto the Twitter highlight, saying, \"so in an effort to shut us down Twitter just confirmed what we suggested was true! Thanks Twitter! They are morons!\" Headlines fromcenter-andleft-ratedoutlets tended to shoot the article down as a false conspiracy; some, including a professor Snopes cited, still hold it could be\u00a0\"possible that there were undercover FBI agents who had infiltrated extremist organizations that participated in the attack on the Capitol.\"",
