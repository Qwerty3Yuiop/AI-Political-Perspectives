Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A Clark County, Nevada official has been <strong>arrested on suspicion of murdering a Las Vegas-area journalist.</strong></p>

<p>County Public Administrator Rob Telles was arrested Wednesday night after police&nbsp;<strong>recovered evidence from his home tying him to the crime scene</strong>. Telles is suspected of murdering Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who was found&nbsp;fatally stabbed Saturday. A judge ruled Thursday that Telles would be held without bail.&nbsp;Clark County's sheriff&nbsp;said that "every murder is tragic but the killing of a journalist is particularly troublesome."&nbsp;The district attorney called the evidence "compelling"&nbsp;and said he expects Telles to be charged with murder next week.</p>

<p>German spent 30 years covering crime and corruption in the Las Vegas area. In recent months, <strong>he wrote about claims of bullying and hostility in Telles's office</strong>, including allegations that Telles fostered a hostile work environment and had&nbsp;an inappropriate relationship with a staffer.</p>

<p>German's death and Telles's arrest were <strong>covered prominently by news sources from left to right</strong>. Many headlines across the spectrum highlighted how prosecutors said Telles's&nbsp;DNA was found under German's fingernails. Right-rated sources focused more on how Telles is a Democrat.&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review (Right bias)</a> writer <a href="/news-source/jim-geraghty-media-bias">Jim Geraghty (Lean Right bias)</a> cited other recent examples of Democrats in New Jersey and California being convicted in connection to wrongful deaths, and quipped that "I think we're starting to see why some in that party were so enthusiastic about the notion of abolishing the police."</p>
