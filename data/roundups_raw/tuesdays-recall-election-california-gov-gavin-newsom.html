Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The recall election of California Gov. Gavin Newsom is set for Tuesday, with roughly 7.8&nbsp;million ballots cast as of Monday. <a href="/story/california-recall-election-gov-gavin-newsom-draws-near">More than 1.7 million Californians signed a petition to recall Newsom</a>, mainly over gripes with his COVID-19 pandemic restrictions; ballots have to&nbsp;be postmarked, put in drop boxes or returned in-person by Tuesday. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-california-recall-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-sees-surge-of-support-as-recall-election-looms-poll-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polls</a> addressed by sources across the spectrum suggest Newsom's chances of remaining in office are good, and have improved in recent weeks; Democrats hold a nearly 2-to-1 voter registration advantage in California. Conservative Larry Elder is the frontrunner to contend with Newsom out of the 46 challengers on the ballot. Newsom has reportedly spend roughly $36 million on the anti-recall effort; Elder had reportedly raised $4.5 million by the start of last month. Counties must certify their results by Oct. 14.</p>

<p>The recall has made headlines on all sides, with many analyzing the recall's potential consequences, both for California and national politics. Left-rated sources often highlighted polls and pundits who projected the recall to fail; some left-rated voices framed the possibility of Elder winning as disturbing and dangerous.&nbsp;Right-rated sources often concentrated on Newsom's fundraising efforts and support he's received from national political figures, including President Joe Biden; some accused Democrats of fear-mongering to help Newsom remain in office.</p>
