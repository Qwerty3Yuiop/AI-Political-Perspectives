Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>On Tuesday, ABC News&nbsp;suspended "The View" host Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhITfM4bqO8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she said the Holocaust was "not about race,"</a>&nbsp;but about "man's inhumanity to other man" and that it involved "two white groups of people."</p>

<p>Goldberg later <a href="https://twitter.com/WhoopiGoldberg/status/1488320164517101574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apologized</a>&nbsp;on Twitter for the comments, saying she "stands corrected" and that "she should have said [the Holocaust] is about both" race and inhumanity. Before the apology and during her pre-taped segment for "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert, Goldberg&nbsp;also said that the Nazis "had issues with ethnicity, not with race, because most of the Nazis were white people and most of the people they were attacking were white people." She made the initial comments when The View&nbsp;hosts were discussing <a href="/news/2022-02-01-0740/there-s-simple-reason-demands-ban-books-maus-are-soaring">the banning by a Tennessee school board of "Maus,"</a> a graphic novel about Nazi death camps during World War II.&nbsp; The school board cited profanity and nudity as reasons for banning&nbsp;the book, which has won a Pulitzer Prize.</p>

<p>The comments and suspension were covered across the spectrum, with more attention coming from right-rated outlets. Some on the right highlighted ABC insiders who <a href="/news/2022-02-01-1356/whoopi-goldberg-deep-s-t-and-should-be-fired-abc-insiders-claim">purportedly called for Goldberg to be fired</a>, and framed her comments on Colbert's show as her <a href="/news/2022-02-01-0742/whoopi-doubles-down-holocaust-remarks-despite-apology-they-had-issues-ethnicity">"doubling down" on her previous remarks</a>. One writer for <a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review (Right bias)</a> took a different stance, arguing that <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/whoopi-goldergs-suspension-from-the-view-is-illiberal-and-irrational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldberg's suspension was unwarranted</a> and&nbsp;that her "only crime was being wrong in public." Some opinions from the left, including from <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Left)</a> and <a href="/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias">NBC News (Lean Left)</a>, said Goldberg's remarks <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/opinions/whoopi-goldberg-ron-desantis-holocaust-comments-filipovic/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimized the Holocaust</a> and could enable bad actors <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/whoopi-goldberg-s-holocaust-comments-view-could-inadvertently-help-fascists-ncna1288360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"to try to appropriate Nazi imagery and Jewish suffering."</a>&nbsp;<em>Editor's Note: this summary initially said that Goldberg's Twitter apology came before her comments on Colbert's show. That was untrue and has been corrected.</em></p>
