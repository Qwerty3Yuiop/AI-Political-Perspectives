Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Donald Trump claimed that the <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-us-economy-adds-73000-jobs-july-falling-short-expectations">latest jobs report</a> was rigged, and fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer, sparking bipartisan criticism.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>"The BLS estimates a mere 73,000 jobs were added last month, almost all in healthcare and social assistance. It also revised down gains for May and June by a combined 258,000, to a total of 33,000 new jobs, one of the biggest downward revisions in years," according to the <a href="/news-source/wall-street-journal-opinion">Wall Street Journal Opinion (Lean Right bias)</a>. Trump said,&nbsp;"Today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad."</p>

<p><strong>How The Left Covered It: </strong>Voices on the left <a href="/news/2025-08-04-0640/economy-and-jobs-politics-17-hours-ago-white-house-doubles-down-baseless-rigged">said</a> Trump's moves were baseless and authoritarian.&nbsp;One <a href="/news-source/cnn-editorial">CNN Opinion (Left)</a> piece said Trump was trying to remake reality and "acting without restraint," adding that "Trump’s personal embarrassments often lead him to pursue authoritarian outcomes." <a href="/news-source/vox-news-media-bias">Vox (Left)</a> <a href="/news/2025-08-04-0641/economy-and-jobs-jobs-numbers-were-bad-so-trump-fired-messenger">noted</a>&nbsp;that "When BLS released similar downward revisions in August 2024, Trump&nbsp;complained&nbsp;that the Biden administration was 'caught fraudulently manipulating Job Statistics to hide the true extent of the Economic Ruin they have inflicted upon America.'”</p>

<p><strong>How The Right Covered It:</strong> Opinions published in more pro-establishment outlets on the right, such as The Wall Street Journal and&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/national-review-opinion-media-bias">National Review (Right)</a> <a href="/news/2025-08-04-0643/economy-and-jobs-trump-shooting-messenger">agreed</a> with those from the left that Trump was shooting the messenger without solid evidence that the report was 'rigged.' <a href="/news-source/cnn-business-media-bias">CNN Business (Lean Left)</a> and the Journal <a href="/news/2025-08-04-0645/economy-and-jobs-trump-says-bureau-labor-statistics-orchestrated-scam-here-s">explained</a> how the BLS report works and provided explanations for why the numbers sometimes include large revisions. In contrast, a piece in <a href="/news-source/american-spectator">the American Spectator (Right)</a> <a href="/news/2025-08-04-0648/economy-and-jobs-trump-should-have-fired-mcentarfer-long-ago">supported</a> Commissioner Erika McEntarfer's firing, saying, "She was a Biden appointee whose tenure at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been characterized by disarray."</p>
