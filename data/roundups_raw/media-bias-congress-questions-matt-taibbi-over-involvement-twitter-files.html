Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Journalist <a href="/news-source/matt-taibbi-media-bias">Matt Taibbi (Center bias)</a> was questioned by Congress on Thursday about his <a href="/tags/twitter-files?search=twitter%20files">Twitter Files</a>&nbsp;reporting.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Taibbi was called as a witness by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) during a hearing for the House Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. The committee was <a href="/news/2023-01-10-1026/politics-house-gop-eyes-new-committee-probe-weaponization-federal-government">formed by House Republicans</a> to investigate the Federal Government’s role in censorship via Twitter after Taibbi’s reporting on the Twitter Files&nbsp;<a href="/story/technology-latest-twitter-files-detail-governments-push-content-moderation">showed regular communications</a> between Twitter executives and federal agencies.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Taibbi became engaged in tense confrontations with several Democratic representatives who questioned his standing as a “so-called journalist”, and <a href="/news/2023-03-09-1238/politics-twitter-files-hearing-erupts-matt-taibbi-refuses-reveal-sources-heated">asked for further information</a> about when he was approached by Twitter owner Elon Musk to be involved in the project. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) accused Taibbi of being partial because he was called to be a witness by Republicans. Taibbi insisted he unearthed federal efforts to censor both left and right-wing organizations in his reporting.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> The story received&nbsp;little coverage from Left and Center-rated sources. Right-rated sources elevated Taibbi’s claims that Democrats were trying to bait him into revealing a source, a first amendment violation, and that Taibbi found censorship towards both the left and right. HuffPost focused more on Democrats’ questioning regarding Taibbi’s integrity as a journalist, and noted Jordan previously alleged federal agencies were unfairly targeting conservatives.</p>
