Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The U.S. is home to many religious&nbsp;communities. How do they differ when it comes to views on abortion?<br />
	<br />
	<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/views-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data </a>from <a href="/news-source/pew-research">Pew Research Center (Center bias)</a> shows vastly different beliefs on abortions between religions in the U.S. Eighty-three percent of people who practice Judaism say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, along with 82% of Buddhists and 68% of Hindus. Among Muslims (55%), Orthodox Christians (53%), historically black Protestants (52%) and Catholics (48%), people are more divided. Support for abortion access in all or most cases is much lower among Evangelical Protestants (33%), Mormons (27%) and Jehovah's Witnesses (18%). For some religious people, including many Christians,&nbsp;life begins at conception. For others, such as many Jewish people, it begins at birth.&nbsp;<br />

	Many sources across the political spectrum have covered the <a href="/story/supreme-court-overturn-roe-v-wade-draft-opinion-leak-casey"><em>Roe v Wade</em> Supreme Court&nbsp;leak</a> in the context of religion and faith. News coverage from right-rated outlets often framed&nbsp;the possibility of <em>Roe </em>being overturned as a win for Christians, and painted <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/05/the-scapegoating-of-the-catholic-church/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pro-choice&nbsp;protests at Catholic churches</a> as attempts to suppress religious freedom. Many on the right also highlighted protests at the homes of Supreme Court justices and&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-religion-oregon-salem-0cc228f77cc0ac2d531f4b1e462dfcbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Molotov cocktail&nbsp;incident at the office of a pro-life group&nbsp;in Wisconsin</a> as evidence that Christians were under attack for their pro-life stances. Conversely, some reports from the left highlighted religions in which abortion access is widely promoted and supported, and framed abortion opponents as a religious minority.</p>
