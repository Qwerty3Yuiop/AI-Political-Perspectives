Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>In a <a href="/story/president-biden-lays-out-crime-prevention-strategy">speech about gun violence and crime prevention</a> Wednesday, President Joe Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?512889-1/president-biden-attorney-general-garland-deliver-remarks-gun-crime-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: "Those who say the blood of lib- - 'the blood of patriots,'&nbsp;you know, and all the stuff about how we're going to have to move against the government. Well, the tree of liberty is not watered with the blood of patriots. What's happened is that there have never been - if you wanted or if you think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons." Biden continued by advocating for more gun control, saying "there has always been the ability to limit — rationally limit — the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it."<br />
	<br />
	Many right-rated news outlets reported on the comments, and many right-rated voices reacted to them. Some voices said Biden's words were confusing or disillusioned; others took them as a threat, and a warning from Biden that the public&nbsp;would be unable to fight back against a tyrannical U.S. government. Conversely, the comments received little to no coverage from left- and center-rated news sources; some&nbsp;right-rated outlets <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/media-ignore-bidens-threat-to-nuke-americans-lets-compare-that-to-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subsequently&nbsp;reported on that&nbsp;lack of coverage</a>. Business Insider was one of the only non right-rated sources that offered original reporting on the story; it described Biden's comments as a joke and a&nbsp;mockery of "people who think they needed guns to take on the US government."</p>
