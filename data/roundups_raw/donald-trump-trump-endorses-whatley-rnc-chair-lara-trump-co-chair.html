Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former President Donald Trump has endorsed North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley to serve as RNC chair.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Trump also endorsed his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, for co-chair, and said his senior campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, would serve as de facto chief operating officer.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Last week, reports surfaced that current <a href="/news/2024-02-07-0734/politics-ronna-mcdaniel-rnc-chairwoman-plans-step-down">RNC chair Ronna McDaniel told Trump she would step down</a> after the South Carolina primary on February 24.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> “RNC spokesperson Keith Schipper said in a statement on Monday, “Chairwoman McDaniel has been on the road helping elect Republicans up and down the ballot and she will continue working hard to beat Biden this fall.” DNC Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd said, “Whatley already threatened our democracy once before when he spread lies about the results of the 2020 election. Trump is rewarding him in just the latest display that democracy will be on the ballot this November.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>Most media across the spectrum noted Trump’s nomination of a family member in headlines. Outlets from the Left and Center often leaned more into Whatley’s defense of Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
