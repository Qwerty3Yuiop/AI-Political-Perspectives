</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Teachers' unions across the country have expressed concerns about returning to in-person learning without proper COVID-19 safety protocols, despite how many health authorities and politicians are calling for a full return to in-person learning.</p>

<p>Leaders of the Chicago Teachers Union recently <a href="/story/chicago-reaches-deal-teachers-resume-person-classes-after-covid-19-standoff">resolved a week-long standoff with city officials</a> after a&nbsp;new COVID-19 safety plan was approved. Classes had been canceled for four straight days amid concerns about surging COVID-19 cases and a lack of access to tests. Many&nbsp;teachers' unions are also saying that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has been facing <a href="/story/new-cdc-covid-19-quarantine-guidance-welcomed-some-criticized-others">bipartisan criticism</a> for <a href="/story/cdc-criticized-confusing-covid-19-protocols-promises-do-better">"confusing"&nbsp;COVID-19 protocols</a>, has&nbsp;not been "communicating well enough&nbsp;with educators."</p>

<p>Left-rated voices were more likely to criticize&nbsp;the effectiveness of COVID-related government regulations, with one writer arguing that the&nbsp;Chicago Teachers' Union always wanted to return to in-person learning but "the city’s lackluster pandemic safety" prevented that.&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/bloomberg-media-bias">Bloomberg's&nbsp;(Lean Left bias)</a>&nbsp;editorial board&nbsp;believes Democrats need to "break the grip" of teachers' unions on&nbsp;the public school system." Right-rated voices <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/collaboration-between-cdc-and-teachers-union-doesnt-help-our-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have long criticized teachers' unions</a> for using "political clout to stifle innovations&nbsp;that could improve U.S. education." One opinion piece from&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> argued that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/school-students-covid-teachers-unions-remote-learning-chicago" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">funding students directly</a> "would empower families to access educational alternatives" and that more data will soon reveal&nbsp;"the academic, social, and emotional costs" of virtual learning for young children.</p>
