Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Pentagon is ordering all U.S. military personnel to get vaccinated against COVID-19 immediately. <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/25/2002838826/-1/-1/0/MEMORANDUM-FOR-MANDATORY-CORONAVIRUS-DISEASE-2019-VACCINATION-OF-DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE-SERVICE-MEMBERS.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a memo dated Aug. 24</a>, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin directed military department heads "to immediately begin full vaccination" of any unvaccinated troops.&nbsp;Austin made the call following "careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President." The announcement also follows <a href="/story/fda-gives-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-full-approval">the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</a>; unvaccinated troops will be required to receive Pfizer-BioNTech's&nbsp;vaccine, which is the only COVID-19 vaccine with full FDA approval.&nbsp;Austin's memo did not impose a hard deadline or outline specific consequences for those who don't follow the order. A Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday that roughly 68% of all military personnel are fully vaccinated; the numbers vary by department, with 40% of the Army fully vaccinated compared to 73% of the Navy.<br />
