Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Following the <a href="/story/russia-brittney-griner-released-prisoner-swap-arms-dealer">U.S.-Russia prisoner exchange</a> that saw WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was arrested in Russia in February, freed in exchange for <a href="/story/world-was-griner-trade-diplomatic-victory-or-concession-russia">Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout</a>, another imprisoned American, Paul Whelan, is receiving media attention and increased calls for his release.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Whelan?:</strong> Whelan, 52, is a former U.S. Marine that served in Iraq and was later dishonorably discharged for larceny. Following his service, he went on to work in Michigan at BorgWarner, an auto-manufacturer. In late 2018, Whelan traveled to Russia to attend a wedding. While there, he was arrested by the Russian Federal Security Service.</p>

<p><strong>Why Was He Arrested?:</strong> Russian authorities claim Whelan traveled to Russia as part of an intelligence operation. Authorities allege that while in Russia, Whelan met with a Russian citizen and acquired a USB drive that contained classified materials. In 2020, Whelan was sentenced to 16 years in prison and is currently being held at a labor camp. Speaking with CNN following Griner’s release, Whelan stated that he “was arrested for a crime that never occurred.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media is Covering It: </strong>Whelan’s ongoing imprisonment is being brought back up across the spectrum in light of him not being included in the exchange. Fox News stated Whelan was “left behind,” and outlined how the Biden Administration sought to include Whelan in the exchange, but Russia refused. CNN interviewed Whelan over the phone, where he expressed disappointment and described the conditions of the Russian labor camp.</p>
