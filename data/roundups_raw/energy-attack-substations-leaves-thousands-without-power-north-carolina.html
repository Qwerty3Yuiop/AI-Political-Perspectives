Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>An apparent attack on electrical substations in Moore County, North Carolina on Saturday left thousands without power and prompted emergency declarations from local officials.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>Roughly 35,000 homes remained without power Monday morning, according to <a href="https://poweroutage.us/area/county/496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerOutage.us</a>.&nbsp;At a press conference on Sunday, Moore County's sheriff said some substations had been shot at by gunfire in a "targeted" attack. The county declared a state of emergency, issued a curfew on Sunday, and closed schools on Monday.&nbsp;The outages could reportedly last until Thursday, and the FBI is now investigating.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote:&nbsp;</strong>"As utility companies began responding to the different substations, evidence was discovered that indicated that intentional vandalism had occurred at multiple sites," the Moore County Sheriff's Office <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MCSheriffOffice/posts/pfbid0g5iWaV6DrimDxiMhb9oQ4qcNqUJsxsSKP9ycWDG84DxbXQnKhNUmHCKeMYCzypd1l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> in a Facebook post. The sheriff also said Sunday that his office had "not been able to tie anything" to <a href="http://www.thepilot.com/news/controversial-drag-show-ends-early-following-power-outage/article_576fbe72-7355-11ed-9e6c-bf04b3a3e425.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that the attack&nbsp;may have been an attempt to disturb a local drag show that was held on Saturday night.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>The attack and outages were a top story from news sources across the political spectrum Monday. Left- and center-rated sources often highlighted the possible drag show connection; right-rated sources didn't.</p>
