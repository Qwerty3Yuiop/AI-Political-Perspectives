Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Congressman Mark Green (R-TN) has officially resigned from Congress to embark on an undisclosed business venture, narrowing the Republicans’ already slim majority in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p><strong>The Details</strong>:&nbsp;Green, a retired US Army officer, <a href="https://markgreen.house.gov/2025/6/rep-mark-green-retires-from-the-u-s-house-of-representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced his intention</a> to step down last month but made the resignation official on Friday, effective July 20. In his <a href="https://x.com/RepMarkGreen/status/1941126588982342109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">departure statement</a>, Green expressed gratitude to his constituents for their trust and support. As he transitions into the private sector, he has hinted at establishing a venture to combat the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but did not provide specifics on this endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>: “While I cannot give the details here, I will be doing something specifically designed to help America compete against the CCP, but this time in business," said Green.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>:&nbsp;Green's departure comes shortly after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a Republican-led initiative. His exit poses a challenge for the GOP's control of the House, a concern amplified by upcoming battles such as the potential government shutdown in the fall.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/cnbc">CNBC (Lean Left bias)</a>&nbsp;focused on the challenges that House Speaker Mike Johnson may face in corralling the Republican majority, given the slim margin for defections. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/new-york-post">The New York Post (Lean Right)</a>&nbsp;focused on the implications for key GOP goals, such as Johnson's plan to pursue another reconciliation bill later this year. Outlets across the political spectrum noted that the loss of Green's seat, even temporarily, could further disrupt the Republicans' control in the House.</p>
