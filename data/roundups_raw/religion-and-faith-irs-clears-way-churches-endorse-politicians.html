Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said churches and houses of worship can now endorse political candidates without endangering their tax-exempt status.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The announcement came in a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25993244/national-religious-broadcasters-ruling.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">court document</a> on Monday regarding a case where the plaintiffs sued over the 1954 Johnson Amendment, arguing it infringes on free speech rights. The amendment,&nbsp;named after then-Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, requires&nbsp;“certain organizations, including churches, to refrain from participating or intervening in campaigns for public office as a condition for their non-profit, tax-exempt status.” The court filing argued,&nbsp;“Bona fide communications internal to a house of worship, between the house of worship and its congregation, in connection with religious services, do neither of those things, any more than does a family discussion concerning candidates. Thus, communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The Johnson Amendment has rarely been enforced, with only one church losing tax-exempt status due to its political activism, according to <a href="/news-source/npr-media-bias">NPR (Lean Left bias)</a>. However, some churches say investigations cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;President Donald Trump has said he wants to eliminate the amendment.&nbsp;Not everyone sees the amendment as a free speech matter, though.&nbsp;Diane Yentel, President and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, said the change could allow politicians to funnel campaign money tax-free.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong><a href="/news-source/fox-business-media-bias">Fox Business (Lean Right)</a> and <a href="/news-source/just-news-media-bias">Just the News (Lean Right)</a> <a href="/news/2025-07-09-0843/taxes-irs-clears-way-churches-endorse-political-candidates">stuck</a> to the facts of the ruling. NPR added the context that endorsements from the pulpit aren't popular. <a href="/news-source/straight-arrow-news-media-bias">Straight Arrow News (Center)</a> was the only outlet of the four to include opposition to the ruling.&nbsp;</p>
