Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Donald Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright said past versions of the National Climate Assessment (NCA) are being reviewed after the Trump administration took them off government websites.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/05/politics/video/chris-wright-trump-energy-secretary-climate-report-src-digvid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a> Wright why past climate reports were taken off government websites, to which he responded, “Because we’re reviewing them and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those.” He also said he “was not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports.” Wright previously <a href="https://x.com/SecretaryWright/status/1952370967780454744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on X, “The ceaseless repeating from the media, politicians and activists claiming that climate change is making weather more dangerous and severe is just nonsense. That is just NOT true.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> In addition to removing past reports from government websites, the Department of Energy (DOE) released a report in July suggesting that climate change is not as severe as previously thought. <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Lean Left bias)</a> noted, “In stark contrast to the National Climate Assessments, which take years to research with multiple rounds of peer review, the five-person Trump report took just two months to research and write, with no peer review.”<br />
	<br />
	<strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> <a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias">The Hill (Center bias)</a> included that “there is a scientific consensus that climate change is exacerbating extreme weather.” CNN highlighted a coalition of scientists planning a response to the DOE’s report and removal of past NCAs, saying these scientists “want to counter what they interpret as the Trump administration’s attempts to wipe credible, widely accepted climate science off the record.” <a href="/news-source/townhall-bias">Townhall (Right bias)</a> published an opinion piece supporting Wright’s stances, writing, “Unlike President Biden, who was an avowed climate alarmist and subsidized the stupid green transition, Trump is a climate realist who advocates for American energy dominance.”<br />
