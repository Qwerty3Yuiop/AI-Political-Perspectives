Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>On Sunday, former President Donald Trump sat down for&nbsp;an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/transcripts/full-transcript-read-meet-the-press-kristen-welker-interview-trump-rcna104778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Kristen Welker on NBC’s “Meet the Press."</p>

<p><strong>Key Details</strong>: During the broadcast, Trump emphasized that it was his decision, after consulting with lawyers,&nbsp;to challenge the 2020 election results.&nbsp;He didn't answer&nbsp;questions about the Capitol riot, such as whether he watched it unfold on television&nbsp;or if he made certain phone calls that day.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>: “You know who I listen to? Myself. I saw what happened. I watched that election, and I thought the election was over at 10 o’clock in the evening,” Trump told NBC.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: Trump faces indictments in <a href="/story/donald-trump-trump-surrenders-face-4th-criminal-indictment-georgia">Georgia</a> and in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal court</a> accusing him of trying to overturn the 2020 election by conspiring&nbsp;with others.&nbsp;He has denied the charges and&nbsp;pleaded not guilty. Special counsel Jack Smith has been focusing on Trump's role in the riot and state of mind post-election.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it</strong>: Some left-rated sources suggested that&nbsp;Trump turned questions about the war in Ukraine, abortion policy, and fiscal policy into a rehash of the 2020 election. Some right-rated sources highlighted how&nbsp;Trump defended his call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he&nbsp;asked officials to look for more votes that could possibly change the election&nbsp;results in that state.</p>
