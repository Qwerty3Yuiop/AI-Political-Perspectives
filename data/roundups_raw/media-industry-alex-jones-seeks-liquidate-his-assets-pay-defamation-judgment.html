Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Alex Jones is seeking to liquidate his personal assets in order to pay his defamation judgement to the families of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> In 2022, a Connecticut jury concluded that Alex Jones, host of <a href="/news-source/infowars" target="_blank">InfoWars (Right bias)</a>, should pay <a href="/story/criminal-justice-alex-jones-ordered-pay-965-billion-sandy-hook-victims-families" target="_blank">$965 million in defamation retribution</a> to the family members of those killed in the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. The defamation suit came from a number of statements made by Jones in the aftermath of the shooting, including claims that the massacre was a hoax concocted to restrict gun rights.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> Jones’ previously filed for bankruptcy, but on Thursday, his attorney submitted a new filing requesting to change to a Chapter 7 liquidation. Included in the expected liquidation is Free Speech Systems, the parent company of InfoWars, Jones’ media outlet. A sale of Free Speech Systems would mean Jones would no longer control the media outlet he founded in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> “There is no reasonable prospect of a successful reorganization,” Jones’ lawyer said in the filing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Outlets across the spectrum characterized Jones as a “conspiracy theorist.” <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias" target="_blank">CNN (Lean Left bias)</a> specifically labeled him a “right-wing conspiracy theorist,” adding that he has used InfoWars to “poison the public discourse with vile lies and conspiracy theories, but also to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars.” A large portion of coverage across the spectrum focused on a recent emotional outburst from Jones during an episode of InfoWars.</p>
