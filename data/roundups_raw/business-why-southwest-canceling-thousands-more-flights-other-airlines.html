</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-southwest-airlines-cancels-thousands-flights-expected-cancel-more">Southwest Airlines</a> canceled <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/cancelled/yesterday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 2,500</a> more flights on Wednesday — many times more than other airlines — amid nationwide flight troubles due to winter storms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Latest Developments: </strong>A Denver International Airport official told <a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias">The Hill (Center bias)</a> that about <a href="/news/2022-12-29-0622/business-estimated-1000-travelers-slept-denver-airport-monday-amid-southwest">1,000</a> travelers were forced to sleep at the airport Monday night after Southwest’s cancellations. Baggage claims&nbsp;also filled&nbsp;up with <a href="/news/2022-12-29-0617/business-unclaimed-luggage-piles-airports-following-southwest-cancellations#">luggage</a> as airports managed both the expected surge of holiday travelers and travelers with canceled flights. Rival airlines like Delta and United began <a href="/news/2022-12-29-0619/business-rival-airlines-cap-fares-southwest-cancellations-continue">capping ticket prices</a>&nbsp;in some cities to help stranded travelers, a move praised by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How Did This Happen? </strong>Airlines have faced <a href="/news/2022-08-24-0604/airline-crew-shortages-delayed-flights-leave-passengers-angry-frustrated-worst">staffing issues</a> since the travel industry&nbsp;began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic; according to a <a href="/news-source/bloomberg-media-bias">Bloomberg (Lean Left bias)</a> report, a Southwest executive warned of an <a href="/news/2022-12-29-0621/business-southwest-air-memos-showed-growing-alarm-eve-epic-winter-storm">“operational emergency”</a> due to staffing shortages in key cities days before the recent winter storms. However, unions representing Southwest’s pilots and flight attendants pointed to vulnerable and <a href="/news/2022-12-29-0435/technology-southwest-didn-t-heed-calls-upgrade-tech-meltdown-unions-say">outdated computer systems</a>, which struggled&nbsp;amid the chaos and reportedly forced flight attendants to keep track of passengers manually. Furthermore, one&nbsp;Southwest flight was <a href="/news/2022-12-29-0624/business-southwest-airlines-flight-diverted-milwaukee-due-potential-mechanical">diverted</a> from its destination on Wednesday due to a “potential mechanical issue.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Thursday morning, including in local outlets across the country. While coverage&nbsp;was mostly nonpolitical regardless of the outlet’s bias rating, coverage from the right was slightly more likely to focus on Buttigieg.&nbsp;<em>Update 10:10 a.m. ET: Previous version incorrectly stated that the 1,000 Denver travelers were stranded Wednesday night, instead of Monday night.&nbsp;</em></p>
