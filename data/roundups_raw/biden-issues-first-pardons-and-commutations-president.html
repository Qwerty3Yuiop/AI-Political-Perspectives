Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President&nbsp;Joe Biden&nbsp;announced Tuesday that he granted clemency to 78 individuals.<br />
	<br />
	The moves mark the first time Biden has used his constitutional clemency powers as president. Three people were pardoned, and 75 received commutations of their sentences.&nbsp; All are people who were&nbsp;convicted of low-level drug offenses or nonviolent crimes.&nbsp;Two of the pardons were people with low-level drug offenses, and the third was given to an 86-year-old former U.S. Secret Service agent who was&nbsp;accused of trying to sell a copy of a Secret Service file in 1964.<br />
	<br />
	Reports across the spectrum highlighted how all the people granted clemency were nonviolent offenders. Reports from left- and center-rated sources often highlighted the community service performed by some of the people Biden pardoned. Coverage from the right more often focused on the specific details of the offenses in question. One report from Washington Examiner highlighted <a href="/story/biden-approval-ratings-remain-low">Biden's low approval ratings</a> and connected them to purported public discontent with Biden's approach to criminal justice.</p>
