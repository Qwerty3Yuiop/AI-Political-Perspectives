</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A gunman killed three people and injured five more in a shooting at Michigan State University (MSU) on Monday before taking his own life, according to police.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>The shooting began at an academic building and moved to the nearby student union area and other buildings. Hundreds of officers responded as students sheltered in place.&nbsp;Four hours after the first shots were reported, police said they confronted the suspect several miles from campus, who then died&nbsp;from a self-inflicted gunshot.&nbsp;The suspect had no known ties to&nbsp;MSU as a student or employee.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</strong>"This truly has been a nightmare that we are living tonight, but we have remained laser-focused on the safety of our campus, our students, and our surrounding community," the MSU deputy police chief said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to</a> the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 67 U.S. shootings&nbsp;in which at least four people were killed or wounded so far in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Sources across the spectrum covered the news as a top story Tuesday. Some right-rated sources, such as Fox News, highlighted the suspect's race; left- and center-rated sources usually didn't.</p>
