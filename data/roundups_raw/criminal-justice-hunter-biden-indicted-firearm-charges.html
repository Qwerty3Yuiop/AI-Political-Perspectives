Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Hunter Biden was indicted Thursday by Special Counsel David Weiss for allegedly lying on a government form and possessing a firearm while being an active user of illegal drugs.</p>

<p><strong>Indictment Details:</strong> The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23977714-hunter-biden-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indictment contains three charges</a>. Two allege that in 2018, Biden lied on a government form required to purchase a firearm. As stated in the indictment, the form “requires that the prospective purchaser certify truthfully that he or she is not an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” Biden has admitted to being an active user of crack cocaine during this period of time. Biden signed this form “when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.” Biden also faces a criminal charge for possessing a firearm while “knowing that he was an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance as defined in Title 21, United States Code, Section 802.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Back in June, Biden appeared to reach a <a href="/blog/hunter-biden-reaches-plea-deal-over-taxes-firearm-charges">plea deal with federal prosecutors</a> in which he agreed to plead guilty to two tax-related charges and participate in a pretrial diversion agreement for the firearm related charges. That plea deal <a href="/blog/hunter-bidens-plea-deal-falls-apart">fell apart in July</a> after the two sides failed to reach an understanding on the stipulations of the agreement.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Outlets across the spectrum covered the indictment prominently Thursday, connecting the charges to the <a href="/story/politics-biden-impeachment-political-theater-or-legitimate-misconduct-probe">impeachment probe</a> launched against President Joe Biden this week.</p>
