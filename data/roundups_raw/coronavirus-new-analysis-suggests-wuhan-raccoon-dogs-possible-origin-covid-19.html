Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A new analysis by an international group of researchers&nbsp;found evidence that COVID-19 originated from infected animals sold at a market in Wuhan, China.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> A French scientist uncovered genetic data uploaded by Chinese researchers to the global virology database GISAID. The data suggested raccoon dogs sold at the market could have been carrying the virus; it&nbsp;disappeared from the database shortly after appearing, but the findings were presented to the World Health Organization on Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>The findings come just weeks after the U.S. Department of Energy <a href="/blog/lab-leak-theory-returns-after-doe-report">changed its&nbsp;stance</a> on COVID-19's&nbsp;origins to believing it likely&nbsp;leaked from a lab in Wuhan, rather than originating through natural transmission. The&nbsp;change prompted widespread&nbsp;media coverage and debate. The new analysis, which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, was first reported on by <a href="/news-source/atlantic">The Atlantic (Left bias)</a>. Several of the analysis’ authors reached&nbsp;similar conclusions in a February 2022 analysis that was first shared with <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean left)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Outlets across the spectrum weighed the claim differently, but most agreed it doesn't prove anything for certain. <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner">Washington Examiner (Lean Right)</a> elevated comments from a Rutgers University lab director who said&nbsp;the claim “should not be taken at face value” because the data cited “has not been made available for analysis.”</p>

Through a swirl of data obfuscation by Chinese authorities and politicalization within the United States, and rampant speculation from all corners of the world, many scientists have stood by the notion that this outbreak—like&nbsp;most others—had purely natural roots.
