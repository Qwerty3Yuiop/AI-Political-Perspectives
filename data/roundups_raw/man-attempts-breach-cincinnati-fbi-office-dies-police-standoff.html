Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A man <strong>attempted to breach an FBI office in Cincinnati</strong> before fleeing and dying in a police standoff hours later.</p>

<p>According to police and<a href="https://twitter.com/FBICincinnati/status/1557902772359528449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> FBI Cincinnati</a>, a subject armed with an AR-15-style rifle tried to breach the building's visitor screening facility and <strong>fired a nail gun at personnel</strong> Thursday morning. The breach triggered an alarm, and the person fled onto the interstate. He was later killed in a standoff with police in a rural area off Interstate 71.</p>

<p>The suspect was a 42-year-old man who sources across the political spectrum say <strong>was at the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021</strong>. He had reportedly posted on social media in recent days about wanting to harm FBI agents in response to the FBI's raid of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida; his social media accounts have since been wiped or suspended. No one else was killed or injured.</p>

<p>Left- and center-rated news sources <strong>covered the story much more prominently</strong> than right-rated sources did, and many highlighted the suspect's connection to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and posts encouraging violence against the FBI. Some left-rated voices had already written about the <a href="/news/2022-08-10-0705/what-comes-after-search-warrant">possibility of political violence</a> in response to the Mar-a-Lago raid before the attack in Cincinnati.</p>
