Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Missile strikes on a train station in eastern Ukraine killed at least 50 people and injured over 100 on Friday, according to Ukrainian authorities.<br />
	<br />
	Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said that "Russians carried out two missile strikes on railway station in Kramatorsk, where evacuation of civilians was taking place" and that "Russian war criminals not only deliberately targeted thousands of people; they've used cluster munitions." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attack represented&nbsp;"an evil without limits."<br />
	<br />
	Russia denied launching any missiles in the Kramatorsk area Friday, calling the attack a Ukrainian provocation and alleging&nbsp;that the missiles used "are used only by the Ukrainian armed forces." Ukrainian authorities say thousands of people, mostly women and children, were awaiting evacuation at the station when the missiles hit.<br />
	<br />
	The attack was covered prominently across the political spectrum. Many highlighted photos appearing to show that Russia wrote "for children" on one of the missiles used in the attack; some reported that they couldn't confirm who wrote the words on the missile.&nbsp;</p>
