Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Last week, a New Jersey businessman testified that he bribed Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are charged with <a href="/story/criminal-justice-sen-menendez-faces-new-obstruction-justice-charge" target="_blank">18 criminal counts in the wide-reaching bribery case</a>. Prosecutors allege Menendez accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for favorable actions toward the governments of Egypt and Qatar. Both Menendez and his wife pleaded not guilty to the charges. Nadine Menendez’s trial is delayed until July while she undergoes treatment for breast cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Details: </strong>Last week, a New Jersey businessman named Jose Uribe testified that he bribed Menendez in 2019 by giving Mendenz’s wife a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for Menendez stopping a criminal probe involving Uribe and an associate of his. Uribe pled guilty to a handful of charges in March and agreed to cooperate with the investigation into Menendez. During his plea, Uribe stated, “I knew that giving a car in return for influencing a United States senator to stop a criminal investigation was wrong.” The former New Jersey attorney general Gurbir Grewal also testified last week, stating that Mendendez contacted him about the case involving Uribe. Additionally, an FBI investigator testified that while listening in on a dinner conversation between the Menendez couple and a group including an Egyptian government official, she heard Nadine Menendez state, “What else can the love of my life do for you?”</p>
