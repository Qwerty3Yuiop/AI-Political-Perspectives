Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was admitted into the critical care unit at the Walter Reed Military Medical Center following symptoms indicating a severe bladder issue.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Austin was admitted to critical care after undergoing a series of tests and examinations indicating an emergent bladder issue. Non-surgical procedures were carried out under general anesthesia to address the problem. Before admittance, Austin transferred his official responsibilities to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks. This action has canceled Austin's planned meetings with NATO defense ministers and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels; the meetings will now be held virtually.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>In early December, <a href="/story/joe-biden-lloyd-austin-white-house-criticized-over-defense-secretarys-hospitalization">Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer</a> and later admitted to intensive care due to complications from surgery. <a href="/blog/lloyd-austins-secret-hospitalization-sparks-security-concerns">This hospitalization led to a significant controversy</a> as it wasn't disclosed to senior military leaders, Congress, or the White House. Austin later apologized for this lack of transparency.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> <a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias">The Hill (Center bias)</a> provided a timeline of Austin's health condition history. <a href="/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias">NBC News (Lean Left bias)</a> emphasized Austin's plan to resume his duties, asserting that Austin's office has been providing the White House and National Security Council with regular updates on his health. The piece also noted how this transparency marked an improvement over previous communication mishaps. <a href="/news-source/daily-wire">The Daily Wire (Right bias)</a> focused heavily on the controversy surrounding the lack of transparency about Austin's previous hospitalization and the subsequent political reactions, including calls for Austin’s resignation.</p>
