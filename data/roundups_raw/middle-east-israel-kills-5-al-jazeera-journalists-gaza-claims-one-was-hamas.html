Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><a href="/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias">Al Jazeera (Lean Left bias)</a> claimed five of its journalists were killed by a targeted Israeli strike on a media tent near Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital on Sunday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, was a Hamas operative posing as a journalist.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The journalists reportedly killed in the strike were Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa. The IDF said Sharif was a Hamas member responsible for “advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops,” and that it had disclosed intelligence information confirming his affiliation with the group. The claim has been disputed by Al Jazeera and the American nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Al Jazeera <a href="/blog/al-jazeera-state-funded">claims</a> that it is both “independent” and “funded in part by the Qatari government.” In January 2024, the IDF <a href="/story/middle-east-prominent-al-jazeera-journalist-among-those-killed-idf-strike">killed two Al Jazeera journalists</a> who it said were in a vehicle with “a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops.” In May 2024, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet <a href="/story/middle-east-israeli-government-orders-al-jazeera-cease-operations">voted unanimously to suspend Al Jazeera’s operations in Israel</a>. In September 2024, the IDF <a href="/story/middle-east-israeli-forces-raid-and-shut-down-al-jazeera-s-west-bank-office">raided Al Jazeera’s West Bank office</a>, confiscating the network’s equipment and shutting it down for a 45-day period, which has since been <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/7/israel-extends-closure-of-al-jazeera-office-in-occupied-west-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended</a>. According to the CPJ, <a href="https://cpj.org/full-coverage-israel-gaza-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">186 journalists have been killed in the Gaza war</a> so far.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>As of Monday morning, the only outlets from the right that AllSides found to cover the story were <a href="/news-source/breitbart">Breitbart (Right)</a> and <a href="/news-source/daily-mail">The Daily Mail (Right)</a>. Breitbart led by saying Al Jazeera left out Israel’s accusations that Sharif was a Hamas operative, “suggesting instead that Israel had ‘claimed responsibility,’ language typically used to describe terrorism.” Several outlets from the left and <a href="/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias">BBC News (Center)</a> included statements from the CPJ.</p>
