Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv>A Space Force commander was reportedly relieved from his post after he criticized the U.S. military on a conservative podcast. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeier appeared on The Steve Gruber Show to discuss his new book, which claims that Marxist beliefs are becoming more common in the armed forces. On the podcast, Lohmeier said he has witnessed “fundamentally incompatible and competing narratives of what America was, is and should be.”  Lohmeier also said that "the military's inclusion and equity industry and the trainings we're receiving in the military via that industry are rooted in critical race theory which is rooted in Marxism." A Defense Department official <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/15/politics/space-force-lohmeier-fired-after-comments/index.html" target="_blank">said in a statement to CNN</a> that Lohmeier was relieved from his command “due to loss of trust and confidence in his ability to lead.” A Department of Defense directive states that active duty service members may not participate in partisan activities, such as speaking before a partisan gathering; Lieutenant General Stephen Whiting will begin an investigation into Lohmeier's comments to see if they constitute prohibited partisan political activity.  

Some coverage from the left and center tended to highlight the Defense Department's response, as well as Lohmeier's history of speaking about these issues. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight details of Lohmeier's allegations, and pushback from GOP lawmakers. </div> <h2 class="mb-2 leading-6 text-lg text-gray-500 font-medium mt-4 p-0">
