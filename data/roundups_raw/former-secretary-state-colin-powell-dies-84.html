Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former Secretary of State Colin Powell died at the age of 84&nbsp;from COVID-19 complications, his family said Monday.&nbsp;Powell, who was fully vaccinated, was being treated at Walter Reed National Medical Center and was reportedly also suffering from multiple myeloma. After decades of military service, Powell served as Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H. Bush and then as Secretary of State for President George W. Bush.&nbsp; He was a four-star general who was often mentioned as a possible candidate for president, but never ran. President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/18/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-passing-of-general-colin-powell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement Monday</a> calling Powell a "dear friend and a patriot of unmatched honor and dignity."<br />
	<br />
	The news was covered prominently across the spectrum Monday, with most recalling Powell's military career and work as Secretary of State. Some left-rated sources framed Powell's handling of the Iraq War in a negative light.&nbsp;</p>
