Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>New York City is set to pay $21,500 to 320 people involved in protests that took place in the Bronx in the summer of 2020 in response to the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis.</p>

<p><strong>Details: </strong>A class-action lawsuit argued New York City Police mistreated demonstrators by using a police tactic known as “kettling.” The lawsuit states that officers confined protesters until the city’s 8:00 P.M. curfew took effect, at which point they arrested the demonstrators for violating the curfew, with officers reportedly beating and pepper spraying some of the demonstrators. The lawsuit still needs to be approved by a federal judge. Should it go through, ABC News reports it would be the “highest per-person settlement award in a mass arrest class action lawsuit,” totaling nearly $7 million.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>One of the protesters involved in the lawsuit is quoted by ABC News stating, “the violence unleashed upon us that night was intentional, unwarranted, and will be with me for the rest of my life. What the NYPD did, aided by the political powers of New York City, was an extreme abuse of power,” A statement from the NYPD said that “much of the NYPD's policies and training for policing large-scale demonstrations have been re-envisioned based on the findings of the department's own, self-initiated analyses and on the recommendations from three outside agencies who carefully investigated that period.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> The verdict was covered evenly across the spectrum.</p>
