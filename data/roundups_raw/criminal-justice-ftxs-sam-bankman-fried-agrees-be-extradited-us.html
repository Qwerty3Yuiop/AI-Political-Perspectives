Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>FTX&nbsp;founder&nbsp;Sam Bankman-Fried&nbsp;has agreed to extradition from the Bahamas to the&nbsp;United States, where he will face charges for wire fraud stemming from the <a href="/story/banking-and-finance-heres-what-we-know-about-ftx-collapse">collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange platform</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong>:&nbsp;"Whatever trail that got him here this morning, it did not involve me,"&nbsp;said Bankman-Fried's Bahamian lawyer Jerone Roberts. "We understood that Mr. Bankman-Fried intended to waive his extradition," said Franklyn Williams of the Bahamas Department of Public Prosecutions.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: The exact timeline for the transfer is unclear, but the necessary documents are being drafted despite Bankman-Fried's Bahamian attorney claiming he had not been part of the extradition agreement. Bankman-Fried was <a href="/story/banking-and-finance-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-bahamas-charged-fraud">arrested in the Bahamas</a> on Dec.&nbsp;13&nbsp;after an arrest request was made by the U.S. government.&nbsp;FTX allegedly defrauded customers by using their assets in&nbsp;<a href="/story/business-why-did-ftx-collapse-and-what-does-it-mean-crypto">risky investments</a> in Alameda Research, a company also run by Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;The charges include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, violation of campaign finance laws, and commodities and security fraud.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it</strong>: The extradition agreement was covered by sources across the&nbsp;political spectrum. Many media outlets noted that Bankman-Fried says&nbsp;he had no knowledge of customer money being used to fund investments at Alameda, while he has admitted to making managerial mistakes.</p>
