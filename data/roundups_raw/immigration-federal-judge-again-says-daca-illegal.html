Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A revised version of the&nbsp;Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has again been deemed illegal by a federal judge who issued the same ruling previously.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>Judge Andrew Hanen <a href="http://file:///C:/Users/habre/Pictures/Saved%20Pictures/179143490068.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">affirmed</a> his 2021 ruling that former President Barack Obama exceeded his authority when he implemeted the program. Current recipients can keep and extend their protections, but no new applications will be processed.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>The Department of Homeland Security "is enjoined from implementing Final Rule DACA until a further order of the Court, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court of the United States," Hanen wrote. "As we have long maintained, we disagree with the District Court's conclusion that DACA is unlawful, and will continue to defend this critical policy from legal challenges," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Biden administration had&nbsp;revised DACA in an effort to bolster its legal status. There were more than 580,000 DACA participants at the end of 2022, <a href="https://www.fwd.us/news/daca-anniversary/#:~:text=Some%20580%2C000%20individuals%20make%20up,and%20Immigration%20Services%20(USCIS)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to</a> government data.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Sources across the spectrum covered the news. Bias reflected root differences on immigration. Right-rated sources focused more on Hanen's reasoning; left and center-rated sources focused more on the Biden administration's response. <a href="/news-source/reuters">Reuters (Center bias)</a> described Hanen as "Republican-appointed." Many on the left and center said new applications "would not be allowed." <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> highlighted how&nbsp;Hanen DHS can "accept" new applications but "may not grant any."</p>
