</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>What are the takeaways from Donald Trump's and Joe Biden's <a href="/story/2024-presidential-election-joe-biden-donald-trump-win-michigan-primaries">wins Tuesday night in Michigan</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Trump Versus Haley</strong>: While&nbsp;former President Donald Trump won easily over former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley (roughly 68.1% to 26.5%), Haley scored a big enough percentage to&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4490043-trumps-victories-overshadow-weaknesses-in-reelection-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise some questions</a> about Trump's standing in&nbsp;the general election among moderate Republicans and independent voters. Haley plans to stay in the race at least past Super Tuesday on March 5.</p>

<p><strong>Joe Biden's Support of Israel</strong>: Roughly 100,000 voters in Michigan voted "uncommitted" to protest President Biden's support of Israel. After this stronger-than-anticipated protest vote (13.2% of Democratic voters), the Biden campaign and Democratic officials planned to double their efforts to win back former supporters.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: Some&nbsp;have said&nbsp;they'd&nbsp;prefer <a href="/blog/when-there-s-election-nobody-wants">younger or alternate candidates</a>, but based on the primaries so far, voters seem to prefer Trump and Biden over the other options.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It</strong>: Some sources on the left framed Haley's performance as an issue for Trump, while some sources on the right framed it as a landslide Trump win. Others across the spectrum highlighted the impact of the "uncommitted" Democratic vote on Biden's performance.</p>
