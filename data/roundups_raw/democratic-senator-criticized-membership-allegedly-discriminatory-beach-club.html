Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse&nbsp;received criticism this week for defending his membership to an exclusive Rhode Island Beach club that some claim have discriminatory policies against people of color. In <a href="https://www.golocalprov.com/news/its-a-long-tradition-in-ri-whitehouse-defends-familys-membership-in-all-whi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Friday&nbsp;interview with local news site&nbsp;GoLocal Providence</a>, Whitehouse was asked if&nbsp;club had admitted any minorities&nbsp;since 2017, when <a href="https://www.golocalprov.com/news/VIDEO-Senator-Whitehouse-Wont-Quit-All-White-Exclusive-Private-Club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoLocal first posed the question</a>. “I think the people who are running the place are still working on that and I’m sorry it hasn't happened yet," Whitehouse replied. “It's a long tradition in Rhode Island and there are many of them and I think we just need to work our way through the issues." <a href="https://www.golocalprov.com/news/VIDEO-Senator-Whitehouse-Wont-Quit-All-White-Exclusive-Private-Club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoLocal also reported</a> that Whitehouse pledged to leave the club in 2006 when he ran for the Senate. A spokesperson for the senator&nbsp;said Monday that the beach club&nbsp;has no&nbsp;"restrictive policy” surrounding race or ethnicity.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/20/style/summer-places-at-bailey-s-beach-the-ruling-class-keeps-its-guard-up.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2003 the&nbsp;New York Times described Bailey's Beach Club</a>, also known as&nbsp;Spouting Rock Beach Association,&nbsp;as a place for America's “ruling class," with members such as the Vanderbilt family and the Astor family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some on the left accused&nbsp;Whitehouse of hypocrisy for advocating for racial equality in the Senate, yet belonging to a purportedly discriminatory club; many reports from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted the claim that the club doesn't allow minorities. Some <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/imagine-if-sheldon-whitehouse-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right-rated outlets</a>&nbsp;claimed that Whitehouse would be criticized much more harshly if he were a Republican instead of a Democrat.</p>
