Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said the “more experienced” President Joe Biden would be better for Russia than former President Donald Trump, the GOP’s likely 2024 presidential nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> In an interview with state-owned Russian TV channel Rossiya 1, Putin said he found Biden “predictable,” while emphasizing that Russia would work with “any U.S. leader whom the American people have confidence in.” This indirect endorsement from an American adversary sparked reactions from Trump, who labeled it a “great compliment” and cited his prior sanctioning of&nbsp;the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as a reason for Putin's opposition.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Trump has previously received criticism for his purportedly cozy relationship with Putin; along with allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Trump famously revealed highly classified information to Russia’s foreign minister and ambassador early on in his presidency. Meanwhile, Biden has made his support for Ukraine a key pillar of his 2024 pitch to voters, making Putin's remarks appear counterintuitive.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>While most headlines framed Putin’s remarks as indicating a personal preference for Biden, a translation by <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> said Putin was specifically asked, “Who is better for us: Biden or Trump?” While coverage across the spectrum noted Trump’s recent comments about NATO, some right-rated outlets highlighted Trump’s reaction to Putin’s remarks, and some left-rated outlets characterized Putin as having “an ulterior motive.”</p>
