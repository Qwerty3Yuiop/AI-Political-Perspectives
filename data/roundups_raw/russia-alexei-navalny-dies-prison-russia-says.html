</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Russian opposition party leader Alexei Navalny died Friday in a Russian penal colony, the Federal Prison Service said.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>Navalny, 47, was one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's biggest foes. Russian officials said Navalny lost consciousness after feeling&nbsp;unwell during a walk, and efforts to revive him were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for Navalny <a href="https://twitter.com/Kira_Yarmysh/status/1758457690429305206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't immediately confirm his death</a> Friday morning and said they were traveling to the prison to learn more.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>"All the necessary resuscitation measures were carried out, but they failed to achieve a positive result,"&nbsp;Russian authorities said.&nbsp;"His death in a Russian prison and the fixation and fear of one man only underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built,"&nbsp;Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. "While awaiting further information, let’s be clear: This is Putin’s sole responsibility," Josep Borrell, head of Foreign Affairs for the European Union, said.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>Navalny had&nbsp;been imprisoned since 2021 on a range of charges, including extremism and contempt.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Sources across the spectrum covered Navalny's death as a top story Friday. Many reports highlighted critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
