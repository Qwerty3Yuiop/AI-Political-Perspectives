Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The funeral for Tyre Nichols was held in Memphis, TN on Wednesday. The service was attended by over 2,000 people, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Rev. Al Sharpton, and film director Spike Lee.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Nichols died three days after being <a href="/story/violence-america-released-footage-shows-memphis-police-beating-tyre-nichols">beaten by members of the Memphis Police Department</a>, who have since been fired and <a href="/story/criminal-justice-five-former-memphis-police-officers-charged-murder">charged with murder</a>. The incident <a href="/story/violence-america-protests-ensue-after-bodycam-footage-nichols-beating-released">sparked protests</a> and <a href="/story/race-and-racism-race-and-police-brutality-debated-following-death-tyre-nichols">renewed calls for police reform</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> “For this to happen to him is just unimaginable,” said Nichols’ mother, adding, “I promise you, the only thing that’s keeping me going is the fact that I really truly believe my son was sent here on an assignment from God.” Vice President Harris spoke at the service, calling for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and stating, “mothers around the world, when their babies are born, pray to God when they hold that child — that that body and life will be safe, for the rest of his life. Yet we have a mother and a father who mourn the life of a young man who should be here today.” Rev. Sharpton said that black Americans “cannot continue to live under these double standards and under these conditions.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>The service was covered more frequently and prominently in left- and center- rated outlets, but coverage itself was consistent. The New York Post called the incident “horrific.” The Guardian outlined ongoing legislative reform efforts mentioned by Harris and Sharpton during the service.&nbsp;</p>
