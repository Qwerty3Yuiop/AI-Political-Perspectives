Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The US State Department may require applicants for tourist and business visas from certain high-risk countries to post a bond of up to $15,000 as part of a 12-month pilot program.</p>

<p><strong>The Details</strong>: The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/05/2025-14826/visas-visa-bond-pilot-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">program</a> is intended to curb visa overstays and is part of President Donald Trump's agenda of tightening requirements for visa applicants. It may require bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 from visa applicants from countries with high visa overstay rates, deficient internal document security controls, or that offer citizenship by investment without a residency requirement. The countries affected by this program have not been specified yet, but will be listed once the program takes effect. The bond could be waived depending on an applicant's individual circumstances and will not apply to citizens of countries enrolled in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/visa-waiver-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visa Waiver Program</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>: The State Department notice says: "Aliens applying for visas as temporary visitors for business or pleasure (B-1/B-2) and who are nationals of countries identified by the Department as having high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or offering Citizenship by Investment, if the alien obtained citizenship with no residency requirement, may be subject to the pilot program.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>:&nbsp;Last week, the State Department announced that many visa renewal applicants would have to submit to an additional <a href="https://immigration.columbia.edu/news/us-department-state-will-require-person-interviews-most-visa-renewals-starting-september-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-person interview</a>, which was not required in the past. The State Department also proposed that applicants for the Visa Diversity Lottery have a valid passport from their country of citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It</strong>: <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">AP News (Left bias)</a>&nbsp;focused on the potential financial burden the bond may impose on visa applicants, making the process potentially unaffordable for many.&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right)</a>&nbsp;highlighted that the proposal is consistent with an executive order signed by Trump to protect the American people, and that it reinforces the administration’s commitment to enforcing immigration laws in the U.S. and safeguarding national security.</p>
