Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor in Donald Trump’s Georgia election interference case, visited the home of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis at least 35 times prior to when they claim their relationship began, a new court filing alleges.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> In January, a co-defendant of Trump <a href="/story/donald-trump-fulton-county-da-accused-improper-relationship-special-prosecutor">accused Willis of engaging in a romantic relationship with Wade</a> prior to him being hired for the case, arguing this creates a conflict of interest and alleging that Willis benefited financially from Wade being hired onto the case.&nbsp; <a href="/story/donald-trump-da-da-trump-case-acknowledges-personal-relationship-denies-wrongdoing">Willis acknowledged the relationship existed earlier this month</a>, but denied any conflict of interest and disputed claims she financially benefited from Wade’s hiring. Willis claimed the relationship began in 2022, after Wade was hired onto the RICO case. Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case, stated previously that Willis and Wade could be disqualified from the case if a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest is established.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> The filing was submitted by Trump’s legal team. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24439600-trump-supplemental-exhibit-wade-cell-phone-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It cites cell phone data obtained from AT&amp;T and analyzed by Charles Mittelstadt</a>, a criminal defense investigator. Mittelstadt claims the data reveals a “minimum of 35 occasions when Mr. Wade’s phone connected for an extended period to either one of those towers in closest proximity” to Willis’ residence prior to when Willis and Wage claimed their relationship began.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Outlets across the spectrum covered the development prominently and consistently on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
