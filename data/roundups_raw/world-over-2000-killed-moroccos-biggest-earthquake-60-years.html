Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Nearly 2,500 people are confirmed dead and thousands injured after a 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit Morocco on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>The quake's epicenter was in&nbsp;Morocco's High Atlas Mountains, southwest of the city of&nbsp;Marrakech. Officials say areas with older buildings experienced the most destruction. <a href="https://twitter.com/volcaholic1/status/1700493184332136488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video</a> shows some villages reduced to rubble, and several aftershocks added to the damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;King Mohammed VI ordered three days of national mourning, and directed food and water to be sent to those who lost homes.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it:&nbsp;</strong>Left- and center-rated sources covered the earthquake much more prominently than right-rated sources did. Many focused on recovery efforts and harrowing stories from survivors.</p>
