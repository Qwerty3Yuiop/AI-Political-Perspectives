Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A cyberattack is&nbsp;not thought to have triggered widespread outages for AT&amp;T customers in the U.S. on Thursday, the company announced.</p>

<p><b>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</b>"Based on our initial review, we believe the outage was caused by the application &amp; execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network, not a cyberattack," AT&amp;T <a href="https://twitter.com/ATTNEWS/status/1760838842322661545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> on X Friday.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>The outage sparked federal agencies to investigate a possible cyberattack amid broader concerns about hacking threats from <a href="/news/2023-03-30-1342/russia-secret-trove-offers-rare-look-russian-cyberwar-ambitions">Russia</a> and <a href="/news/2024-01-31-1610/china-us-disrupts-chinese-hacking-campaign-targeting-critical-infrastructure">China</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Sources across the spectrum covered the update, but not as prominently as they covered the initial outage.</p>
