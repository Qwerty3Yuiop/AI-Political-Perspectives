Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech on Friday that he&nbsp;had no legal authority to change the outcome of the 2020 election, rebuking the claim&nbsp;made by former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"President Trump is wrong,"&nbsp;Pence said during&nbsp;his speech at a Federalist Society event in Florida.&nbsp;"Frankly there is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president." Pence's recent comments are&nbsp;the strongest rejection of Trump’s efforts to change the results of the 2020 election,&nbsp;which he has kept relatively quiet on since Joe Biden took over as president. The former vice president, who <a href="/story/mike-pence-launches-conservative-advocacy-group">launched a conservative advocacy group</a>&nbsp;last&nbsp;April,&nbsp;also suggested that the Republican Party would take back the White House in&nbsp;2024. Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-slams-old-crow-mitch-mcconnell-pence-he-was-wrong-2022-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released a "fiery" statement</a> on Friday night in response to Pence's comments, calling the former vice president “an automatic conveyor belt” for the "Old Crow" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell&nbsp;to get Biden elected President "as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>Pence's comments were prominently covered across the spectrum, with most outlets emphasizing how Trump and Pence's relationship has&nbsp;"<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/03/pence-says-he-and-trump-dont-see-eye-to-eye-on-jan-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soured</a>" in <a href="/blog/one-year-later-reflections-january-6-us-capitol-riot-differ">the year since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot</a>. Some left-rated outlets noted how Pence "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/us/politics/pence-trump-election.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stopped short of completely breaking</a>" off from Trump's base, which remains a large portion of the Republican Party. Many right-rated voices such as <a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review (Right bias)</a>&nbsp;expressed how&nbsp;it was "<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/good-for-mike-pence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good</a>" to&nbsp;see Pence criticize&nbsp;Trump "forcefully and by name," highlighting how the former vice president's&nbsp;"commitment to the U.S. Constitution and deep faith&nbsp;made him do the right thing in the face of tremendous pressure."</p>
