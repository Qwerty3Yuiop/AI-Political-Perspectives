Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former President Donald Trump is safe following an apparent assassination attempt at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Reportedly, an individual targeted Trump, and the Secret Service fired at him before finding his weapon in a bush. A “law enforcement source” reportedly told <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Lean Left bias)</a> a person has been detained in connection with the incident. <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> cited a “U.S. official” who said, “This does not appear to be some random guy with an AK-47 walking outside Trump's club.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Trump survived <a href="/blog/misinformation-watch-did-google-omit-trump-assassination-attempt-searches-design">an attempt on his life</a> at a rally in Butler, PA, in July.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote:</strong> “President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity. No further details at this time,” said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. Trump told Fox News host Brett Baier, “Tell everybody I am fine and the Secret Service did a great job.” Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/1835403813475570113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on X, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>Fox News prominently noted that authorities are treating the case as an assassination attempt. <a href="/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias">BBC (Center bias)</a> mentioned the July attempt on Trump’s life. CNN’s initial coverage was short and did not include much context beyond its reporting.</p>
