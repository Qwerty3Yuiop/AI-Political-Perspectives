Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>In a 3-hour <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6rAgS1KiUvLRNP4HfUePpA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast episode</a> released Wednesday, podcast host&nbsp;Joe Rogan talked with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta about COVID-19 vaccines, <a href="/blog/joe-rogan-ivermectin-and-false-stories-weekend-media-bias">ivermectin</a>, and more. Rogan said CNN “outright lied” when it said he had taken “horse dewormer”; Rogan says he's taken&nbsp;a prescribed dose of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin, rather than the veterinary form of the drug, which <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-treatments-evolving-threat/story?id=75946569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some people have taken</a> contrary to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FDA warnings</a>. Gupta replied that CNN “shouldn’t have said that.”&nbsp;Gupta also tried to convince Rogan to support COVID-19 vaccines for groups Rogan had previously said didn't need it; Gupta&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/13/health/sanjay-gupta-joe-rogan-experience/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later wrote</a> that the effort&nbsp;was “probably futile” because “his mind was made up.” Rogan said he had attempted to get vaccinated earlier this year but was held back by scheduling conflicts. Rogan also suggested people should “get vaccinated and then get sick” to get the best protection. After Gupta pushed back on that comment, Rogan added that it wasn’t his intention to, as Gupta put it, “recommend people get infected.”</p>

<p>Coverage was sharply divided between left- and right-rated outlets. Left-rated outlets tended to focus on Rogan “admitting” he’d almost gotten vaccinated. Right-rated outlets tended to focus on Gupta “admitting” CNN had improperly framed his use of ivermectin.&nbsp;<em>Update 10/14/21 3:01 ET: Previously stated the episode was released Thursday. The episode is dated on Wednesday, Oct. 13&nbsp;on Spotify.</em></p>
