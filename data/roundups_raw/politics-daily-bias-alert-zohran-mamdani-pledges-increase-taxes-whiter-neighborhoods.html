Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Democratic socialist New York City mayoral candidate <a href="/story/elections-how-did-zohran-mamdani-win-nycs-mayoral-primary">Zohran Mamdani</a> has pledged to increase taxes on “richer and whiter neighborhoods,” which outlets from the right and center have highlighted, while outlets from the left have largely ignored it.</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>In a <a href="https://x.com/NRCC/status/1940772524281008145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign promotion sheet</a>, Mamdani pledged to “Shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods.” Mamdani stood by his proposal in a TV <a href="https://x.com/dcexaminer/status/1939338740154998786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with <a href="/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias">NBC News’ (Lean Left)</a> Meet The Press, when he said, “That is just a description of what we see right now. It’s not driven by race. It’s more of an assessment of what neighborhoods are being under-taxed versus over-taxed,”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Mamdani <a href="/story/politics-socialist-zohran-mamdani-wins-new-york-s-democratic-mayoral-primary">defeated</a> former New York Governor Chris Cuomo in the Democratic primary last week – a result media across the spectrum described as “stunning.” Mamdani <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-mamdani-nyc-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won</a> neighborhoods with higher median household incomes, young people, and the Asian vote, while Cuomo won lower-income neighborhoods, 55+ voters, and the black vote. Mamdani will run against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who was a Democrat but r<a href="/story/politics-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-run-re-election-independent">ecently switched</a> to an Independent, as well as&nbsp;Cuomo (now in the Fight and Deliver party) and Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Several outlets from the right and center, such as <a href="/news-source/npr-media-bias">BBC (Center)</a>, <a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias">The Hill (Center)</a>, <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">The New York Post (Lean Right)</a>, <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek (Center)</a>, and <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner">The Washington Examiner (Lean Right)</a> have highlighted Mamdani’s pledge about “whiter” neighborhoods. Outside of the television coverage from NBC, where the interviewer questioned Mamdani on it, AllSides did not find an outlet from the left that mentioned the “whiter” phrasing. For instance, <a href="/news-source/npr-media-bias">NPR (Lean Left)</a> interviewed Mamdani on July 1 but didn’t mention it in coverage or ask about it.</p>
