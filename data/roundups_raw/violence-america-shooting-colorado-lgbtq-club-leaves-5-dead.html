Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A shooting at an LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs left at least five people dead and 25 injured early Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</strong>"At least two heroic people confronted and fought with the suspect and were able to stop the suspect from continuing to kill (and) harm others," Colorado Springs's police chief said during a news conference Sunday morning. "We owe them a great debt of thanks." The city's mayor added that "We are a strong community that has shown resilience in the face of hate and violence in the past, and we will do so again."</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>The suspect, who was <a href="https://coloradosprings.gov/police-department/article/news/deadly-shooting-club-q-colorado-springs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested</a>, reportedly possessed multiple guns, including a rifle. In 2021, a man with the same name and age as the&nbsp;suspect was arrested in Texas in connection to a bomb threat. Colorado has been the scene of some of the country's deadliest mass shootings, including Columbine High School in 1999 and the 2012&nbsp;Aurora movie theater shooting.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it:&nbsp;</strong>Many left-rated outlets made the shooting their top story Monday morning; center- and right-rated sources highlighted it less prominently. Reports from the left often focused on anti-LGBTQ sentiment in Colorado Springs; NBC's headline said it "had some in the community anticipating tragedy," and the <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Lean Left bias)</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/shootings-colorado-gun-politics-springs-7f079c7feebc32cc8ad46f2724844c18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;the club&nbsp;had been "a cherished safe spot for the LGBTQ community in the conservative-leaning city." Coverage across the spectrum focused on the suspect's history and reports of his bomb threat arrest.</p>
