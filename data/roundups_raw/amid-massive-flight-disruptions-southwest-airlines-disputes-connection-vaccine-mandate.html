Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Amid a series of massive flight disruptions,&nbsp;Southwest Airlines <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/11/days-after-forcing-covid-shot-on-workers-southwest-airlines-cancels-1800-flights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denounced&nbsp;“unfounded rumor and speculation”</a> that&nbsp;the&nbsp;company’s recent decision to mandate vaccinations spurred cancellations and delays. The airline <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthwestAir/status/1446915196438581254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446915196438581254%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthefederalist.com%2F2021%2F10%2F11%2Fdays-after-forcing-covid-shot-on-workers-southwest-airlines-cancels-1800-flights%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attributed the "high volume of cancellations"</a>&nbsp;and delays to “weather challenges” in Florida and&nbsp;“unexpected air traffic control issues in the same region.” Southwest canceled a total of 1,826 flights and delayed 1,784 flights on Saturday and Sunday,&nbsp;<a href="https://flightaware.com/live/cancelled/today" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to data from FlightAware</a>. The disruptions continued into Monday with over 360&nbsp;cancellations and 1,300&nbsp;delays.&nbsp;Other airlines were not as severely&nbsp;impacted by these issues; airlines such as American and Spirit canceled&nbsp;2% of flights over the holiday weekend.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) on Friday&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-09/southwest-air-pilots-seek-to-block-covid-vaccination-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a motion to temporarily block the airline's COVID-19 vaccine mandate</a>&nbsp;until an ongoing lawsuit over alleged U.S. labor law violations is resolved; the airline emphasized that the matter won't "require negotiation" moving forward. SWAPA&nbsp;released a statement that <a href="https://www.swapa.org/news/2021/press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed pilots and airline staff were not planning a sickout&nbsp;over the company's vaccination requirements</a>, saying that&nbsp;"management's poor planning" and "external operational challenges" were more probable causes of the cancellations.</p>

<p>Coverage was prominent across the spectrum, with many outlets citing conflicting tallies for the total number of flights&nbsp;canceled. Right-rated voices&nbsp;were more likely to link&nbsp;the cancellations to&nbsp;vaccine mandates protests, a <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1447327311095910402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">narrative advanced by Texas Republicans Ted Cruz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1447611432170889226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chip Roy</a> on Twitter.&nbsp;Some left-rated voices criticized those outlets for making such a connection "even though they offered no evidence of it."</p>
