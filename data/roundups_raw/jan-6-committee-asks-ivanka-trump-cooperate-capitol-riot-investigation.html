Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The House Jan. 6 committee sent a <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-20.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Ivanka%20Trump%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Enclosures_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> to <a href="/news/2022-01-03-1145/ny-ag-subpoenas-ivanka-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-civil-investigation">Ivanka Trump</a> on Thursday asking her to voluntarily cooperate with its investigation.</p>

<p>The committee’s letter included questions about a Jan. 6 phone call by former President Donald Trump which Ivanka Trump reportedly witnessed, internal White House communications surrounding tweets sent by the former president, Donald Trump’s lack of action to deploy the <a href="/news/2021-12-13-1642/meadows-wrote-national-guard-would-protect-pro-trump-people-jan-6-report">National Guard</a>, and efforts by Fox News’ <a href="/news/2022-01-04-1656/house-committee-requests-cooperation-sean-hannity-inquiry-capitol-riot">Sean Hannity</a> and others to dissuade Donald Trump from talking about his election fraud allegations. <a href="/news/2022-01-06-1317/liz-cheney-republicans-looking-other-way-capitol-attack">Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.)</a> told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-liz-cheney-calls-trump-unfit-future-office/story?id=82039304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News (Lean Left)</a> earlier this month that “We have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence.”</p>

<p>Coverage made top headlines in most major outlets on the left and center, as well as some major outlets on the right. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum. Coverage from the left and center tended to describe the Capitol riot more specifically; the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jan-6-ivanka-trump/2022/01/20/7e542a6c-7a15-11ec-9102-d65488c31bb1_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post (Lean Left)</a> referred to it as “when his supporters attempted to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden as president that day,” and the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jan-6-committee-requests-ivanka-trump-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Examiner (Lean Right)</a> called it only “the riot.”</p>
