Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>During former President Donald Trump’s presidency, his businesses received at least $7.8 million from governments and officials from countries like China and Saudi Arabia, a <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2024-01-04.COA%20DEMS%20-%20Mazars%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staff report</a> by House Democrats said Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>In the report, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/oversight-democrats-release-report-proving-trump-pocketed-millions-from-at-least" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that the payments by 20 different countries violated the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which forbids federal officials from accepting gifts without congressional approval. Most of the payments, totaling $5.57 million, came from China.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Donation Disagreement: </strong>A spokesman for Trump told <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> that House Democrats were “desperate to <a href="/story/politics-house-votes-formally-approve-biden-impeachment-inquiry">save face for Hunter Biden</a>,” adding that “foreign profits were donated in full to the United States Treasury.” However, the House report said these donations excluded part-owned properties and “still allowed former President Trump to retain significant emoluments in the form of revenues, which its policy excluded from the funds designated for donation.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage often reflected partisan views on Trump and was generally featured less prominently in right-rated outlets. While a <a href="/news-source/breitbart.">Breitbart (Right bias) </a>headline framed the report as mere allegations, <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> said Trump had engaged in “the kind of conduct the G.O.P. is grasping to <a href="/story/politics-oversight-committee-subpoenas-hunter-and-james-biden-impeachment-probe">pin on President Biden.</a>”</p>
