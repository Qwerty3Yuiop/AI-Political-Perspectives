Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Israeli forces rescued four hostages from Gaza on Saturday who had been abducted from the Nova Music Festival during Hamas’ October 7 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)&nbsp;said the hostages were rescued from two different houses at the Nuseirat refugee camp and found in good medical condition. Hamas reported that 274 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed and hundreds more were wounded during the operation. Israel reported one death, a police officer from its special counterterrorism unit.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Since the two sides exchanged hostages during a temporary ceasefire in December, the IDF has <a href="/blog/misinformation-watch-israel-gaza-conflict#9">offered periodical updates on hostages</a>, most of which have been recovered bodies or confirmed deaths. Per <a href="/news-source/axios">Axios (Lean Left bias)</a>, 120 hostages are still held in Gaza, 42 of whom have been confirmed dead.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Several outlets included context on President Biden and French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron’s joint press conference in Paris, where they welcomed the return of the hostages. <a href="/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias">BBC News (Center bias)</a> included context that the Israeli military estimated less than 100 people died in the rescue operation. Axios said a U.S. official told it that “the U.S. hostage cell in Israel” supported the rescue operation. <a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review (Lean Right bias)</a> noted that just seven hostages have been rescued alive so far.</p>
