Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>At least 12 major U.S. cities set all-time records for homicide in 2021. What's to blame?</p>

<p>Of the dozen that set new records, five surpassed all-time highs&nbsp;that were set or tied just last year.&nbsp;Philadelphia had 13% more homicides this year (521 as of Dec. 6) than last year, and broke its record of 500 that was set in 1990. Philadelphia's total was more than&nbsp;the nation's two biggest cities, New York (443 as of Dec. 5) and Los Angeles (352 as of Nov. 27).&nbsp;According to the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-crime-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">murders increased 30% in the U.S. in 2020</a>, the largest single-year jump in 60 years. Meanwhile, the data shows that the number of arrests fell&nbsp;24% in 2020. Other cities that set all-time homicide records in 2021 include Portland, Oregon; Austin, Texas; and Rochester, New York.</p>

<p>Reports across the spectrum acknowledged how depleted police forces and lower arrest rates in some of the cities contributed to the spikes. Coverage of the news from right-rated sources often highlighted how many of the cities are run by Democrats, and explained how leaders in those cities <a href="/story/californias-theft-penalties-bail-policies-spotlight-amid-crime-wave">moved to cut police funding and lower criminal penalties or incarceration rates</a>&nbsp;over the past two years since the murder of George Floyd. Reports from left-rated outlets often highlighted the COVID-19 pandemic and its many social and cultural consequences as potential factors for higher murder rates. <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/how-do-we-stop-homicide-crisis-think-small-opinion-1660295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One writer for Newsweek (Center bias)</a> highlighted how cities can focus on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and community outreach to curb violent trends.</p>
