Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Trump administration withheld billions of dollars in federal funding from state and local schools that were expected to be released on Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The total amount of funding is estimated to be between $5 and $6.8 billion, according to <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek (Center bias)</a>, and included over $1.2 billion that would have gone to schools in Florida and California. Services that are expected to be impacted by the cut include professional guidance for teachers, after-school initiatives, English language lessons, and support for migrant families. Newsweek reported speaking to a Trump administration official who said the withholding is part of an ongoing funding review and shouldn't be called a freeze.</p>

<p><strong>How Left Media Covered It: </strong>The move was heavily covered by outlets from the left, who often highlighted opposition to it. <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left)</a> prominently wrote, “The administration offered little explanation, saying only that the funds were under review. It gave no timeline for when, or if, the money would be released.” It also led with a quote from an education professional who called the move "catastrophic."</p>

<p><strong>How Right Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong><a href="/news-source/newsmax">Newsmax (Right)</a> was the only outlet from the right that AllSides found to cover the story. Its report focused heavily on voices from the Trump administration and others who supported withholding the funds, and didn't cite any voices who opposed or criticized the move.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The Trump administration has slashed or reviewed significant government spending since taking office in January. Track many of the administration’s cuts with AllSides <a href="/blog/tracking-trumps-cuts-federal-agencies-and-funding">here</a>.</p>
