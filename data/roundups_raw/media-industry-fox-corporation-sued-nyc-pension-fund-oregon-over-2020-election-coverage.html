Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>New York City’s pension funds and the state of Oregon filed a lawsuit against the Fox Corporation on Tuesday. The NYC pension fund and the Oregon Public Employee Retirement Fund both hold shares in Fox, and the two groups allege the media company breached its fiduciary duty by “peddling known falsehoods” following the 2020 election.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The Oregon Public Employee Retirement Fund holds $5.2 million worth of shares in the Fox Corporation, according to <a href="/news-source/epoch-times-media-bias">The Epoch Times (Lean Right bias)</a>. New York City’s pension funds hold $28.1 million worth of shares in the Fox Corporation, according to the <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Lean Left bias)</a>. In April, Fox <a href="/blog/fox-news-settles-lawsuit-over-coverage-2020-election-fraud-claims">settled a defamation lawsuit</a> filed by Dominion Voting Systems. Fox agreed to pay $787.5 million to settle Dominion’s claims that the network knowingly aired false claims that Dominion voting machines were used to manipulate election results.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> New York City Comptroller Brad Lander stated, “Fox’s board of directors has blatantly disregarded the need for journalistic standards and failed to put safeguards in place despite having a business model that invites defamation litigation.” Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum <a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/oregon-attorney-general-rosenblum-sues-fox-corporation-board-for-breach-of-fiduciary-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a>, “The directors’ choices exposed themselves and the company to liability and exposed their shareholders to significant risks. That is the crux of our lawsuit, and we look forward to making our case in court.”</p>
