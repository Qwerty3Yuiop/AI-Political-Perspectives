Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>As evacuations continued this week for Americans and vulnerable Afghans out of Kabul, the conversation about Afghanistan shifted from the troop withdrawal itself to the Biden administration’s strategy for evacuation and withdrawal. <a href="/story/us-and-allies-warn-high-terror-threat-kabul-airport">Thursday’s suicide bombings</a>, which killed at least 13 American soldiers and dozens of Afghans, added greater intensity to the debate. President Joe Biden once again <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?514304-1/president-biden-terrorists-we-hunt-make-pay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defended the withdrawal</a> on Thursday, telling reporters that he would not be deterred by terrorist attacks. Biden reaffirmed his commitment to evacuating all Americans who sought evacuation by <a href="/story/biden-says-us-pace-meet-aug-31-afghanistan-withdrawal-deadline">Aug. 31</a> and said that evacuation efforts would continue for remaining Americans and vulnerable Afghans even after American&nbsp;troops left the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Voices in left-rated outlets were mixed, including writers who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/26/has-bidens-withdrawal-afghanistan-made-us-safer-clearly-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized the withdrawal</a>, called for others not to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/opinion/afghanistan-democrats-midterms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">politicize Afghans’ suffering</a>, said the chaotic withdrawal was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/26/whats-happening-afghanistan-is-horrible-how-else-was-us-involvement-going-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inevitable</a>, and pointed to America’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/opinion/afghanistan-us-withdrawal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20-year military presence</a> itself as the issue. Voices in right-rated outlets were broadly critical of the evacuation strategy and of President Joe Biden specifically, including writers who said Biden was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-harris-blinken-sullivan-afghanistan-withdrawal-crisis-evacuation-taliban-kabul-11629921554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incompetent</a>, criticized the military’s coordination with the Taliban to provide security, called out a purported “<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/was-it-inevitable-that-wed-hand-the-taliban-a-kill-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kill list</a>” of names given to the Taliban to facilitate airport access, and accused Biden of <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/biden-just-prepared-the-public-for-abandoning-americans-in-afghanistan/?utm_source=recirc-desktop&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=right-rail&amp;utm_content=corner&amp;utm_term=first" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoning Americans</a>.&nbsp;</p>

It was called “The Incompetence Dodge,” and it argued that American policymakers and pundits routinely try to rescue the reputation of bad ideas by attributing their failure to poor execution. At the time, they were writing about the liberal hawks who were blaming the catastrophe of the Iraq war on the Bush administration’s maladministration rather than rethinking the enterprise in its totality.
