Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>During a service at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, a woman opened fire in a hallway outside the sanctuary, leading to two injuries.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The shooter, identified as Genesse Moreno, was reportedly wearing a trenchcoat and carrying a backpack, was armed with a long rifle, later identified with the words “Free Palestine” written on it. Moreno is believed to have entered the building with a 7-year-old boy. Moreno was reportedly confronted by off-duty officers from the Houston police and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. The woman was killed, and the 7-year-old boy was shot and critically injured. A 57-year-old man was shot as well, but has since been discharged from the hospital. Law enforcement officials reportedly uncovered anti-semitic writings by Moreno following the shooting.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote:</strong> A <a href="https://www.lakewoodchurch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement on the Lakewood Church</a> website reads, “Our community is devastated by today’s events and grateful for the swift actions of law enforcement. May the healing hands of God touch the lives of everyone involved and provide comfort during this difficult time.” <a href="/news-source/abc-news-media-bias">ABC News (Lean Left bias)</a> quoted <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/lakewood-church-shooting-motive-unknown-pro-palestinian-message/story?id=107158963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">police stating</a>, “We do believe that there was a familial dispute that has taken place between her ex-husband and her ex-husband's family.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Coverage varied by outlet. <a href="/news-source/daily-beast-media-bias">The Daily Beast (Left bias)</a> provided further context to the shooter’s identity and past criminal history, while <a href="/news-source/breitbart">Breitbart (Right bias)</a> mechanics of the shooting, emphasizing that the shooting was stopped by a “good guy with a gun.”</p>
