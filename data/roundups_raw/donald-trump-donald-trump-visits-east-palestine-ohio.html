Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former President Donald Trump paid a visit to East Palestine, Ohio on Wednesday in wake of the ongoing environmental crisis from the train derailment.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Trump donated water and supplies to the town, driving home to event attendees that they “are not forgotten”. While sympathizing with the community and echoing sentiments that something must be done to fix the situation, he also used the visit as an opportunity to angle against President Joe Biden.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Trump <a href="/story/politics-donald-trump-begins-campaign-republican-primaries">recently began his 2024 presidential campaign</a>. His visit comes while Biden is visiting Ukraine and Poland. Neither President Biden nor Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg have visited East Palestine since the accident. Earlier this week <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109886306007974589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Truth Social, Trump claimed</a> the announcement of his trip is what prompted <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/18/fema-sends-help-to-east-palestine-after-refusing-for-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assistance from FEMA</a>. Notable Democrats have <a href="https://twitter.com/SecretaryPete/status/1628133840391704592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1628133840391704592%7Ctwgr%5Eb5c656e4bf4b1b8dd001648fb841caab0ee0fc8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-2892045793607897688.ampproject.net%2F2301261900000%2Fframe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> actions by Trump and Republicans during his presidency helped cause the derailment.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> Trump told the audience “I sincerely hope that when… they get back from touring Ukraine, that he's got some money left over.” Obama-era Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said “If he wants to visit, he's a citizen. But clearly, his regulations and the elimination of them, and no emphasis on safety, is going to be pointed out.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Left and Center-rated sources brought more attention to Trump’s donation of some campaign-branded bottled waters and rolling back of Obama-era safety regulations. Across the spectrum, outlets covered the events under the pretense of an upcoming Presidential campaign.</p>
