Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>As the nation grappled with the Uvalde elementary school shooting, some began scrutinizing how law enforcement officers responded to the violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exact timeline was still somewhat unclear on Thursday, with the <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Center bias)</a> calling the events “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/uvalde-school-shooting-politics-texas-shootings-56a4d01fb1cda19947db89fcb6bd85fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">murky</a>” and pointing to “contradictory accounts” by police. On Tuesday, a Texas Department of Public Safety official told <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Left bias)</a> that law enforcement had exchanged fire with the shooter before he began targeting children; another Texas DPS official said the shooter was killed 40 minutes to an hour after police first encountered him. That official also said police “did contain him in a classroom” — <a href="/news/2022-05-25-0848/victims-texas-school-shooting-killed-single-classroom-authorities-say">a classroom full of students</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a video posted online, frustrated families outside Robb Elementary School urged a group of police officers to enter the building as the shooting took place; some even suggested attempting to stop the shooter themselves. The Border Patrol agents who eventually killed the shooter reportedly considered it a “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/border-patrol-agents-saw-taking-down-uvalde-gunman-as-suicide-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suicide</a>” mission to attack his barricaded position; at least one&nbsp;agent&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/25/border-patrol-agent-injured-texas-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">injured</a> in the assault, but none died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coverage was widespread and prominent from outlets across the political spectrum on Thursday, particularly regarding the video of families gathered outside the school, and many framed the police response in a questionable light. Some coverage reflected polarized attitudes towards police; a <a href="/news-source/vice-media-bias">Vice (Left bias)</a> headline said the police timeline had “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkp7gm/police-timeline-texas-school-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of holes,</a>” and a <a href="/news-source/vice-media-bias">Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)</a> article praised a “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/see-it-picture-shows-shrapnel-wound-on-uvalde-hero-border-patrol-cops-head" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hero</a>” Border Patrol agent.</p>
