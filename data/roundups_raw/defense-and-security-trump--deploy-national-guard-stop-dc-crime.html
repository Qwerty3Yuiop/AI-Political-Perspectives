Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><em>Updated 8/11/25 1:28pm ET</em></p>

<p>President Donald Trump announced plans on Monday to deploy National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. in an effort to "stop violent crime." Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/washington-post-media-bias">The Washington Post (Lean Left bias)</a>&nbsp;reported that the Trump administration plans to temporarily assign over 100 FBI agents to the Capitol for nighttime patrol.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>The move comes after Trump’s announcement on Sunday that he would be <a href="/story/violence-america-trump-discusses-plans-address-crime-homelessness-dc">ramping up efforts to mitigate D.C. crime</a>. The efforts are in response to what the president <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-claims-dc-crimes-trounce-stats-from-notoriously-violent-cities-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims</a> are above average crime rates in the Capitol, despite overall crime there reportedly being down 35% in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote:</strong>&nbsp;Trump said Monday, "Something's out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly&nbsp;– like we did in the southern border. I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor, and worse. This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back."</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Trump <a href="/story/violence-america-trump-discusses-plans-address-crime-homelessness-dc">directed homeless people</a> in D.C. to move out “immediately” on Sunday, and his administration said it would consider deploying the National Guard to the Capitol or taking full federal control last week. About 900 FBI agents have recently been reassigned to assist with immigration enforcement and reform. Trump’s “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/making-the-district-of-columbia-safe-and-beautiful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful</a>” executive order from March states, “As the capital city of the greatest Nation in the history of the world, [D.C.] should showcase beautiful, clean, and safe public spaces.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>News media across the political spectrum credited The Washington Post with the initial FBI report but were otherwise vague about sources prior to Trump's announcement.&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> was critical of FBI reassignments, stating, “It can be challenging for FBI agents to make meaningful contributions to such assignments, given that the bureau’s agents are investigators not trained in patrol-focused policing.” <a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias">The Hill (Center)</a> said Trump is “threatening to federalize the District of Columbia” but also quoted positive remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Both The Hill and <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right)</a> detailed more context around the Trump administration’s reasoning for the move than the Times. New York Post also highlighted Trump’s assertion that he would give homeless people places to stay outside the Capitol.</p>
