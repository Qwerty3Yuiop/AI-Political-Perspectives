Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Sam Brinton, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy’s Office of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition, was charged with grand larceny in connection with the theft of luggage at a Las Vegas airport. Brinton is also facing charges for a similar incident at an airport in Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Brinton’s appointment to the DOE made headlines, as they are the first openly non-binary employee of the federal government. Brinton faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine for the theft of a bag at the Las Vegas Airport. Brinton is scheduled to appear in a Minnesota court on Monday, where they face up to five years in prison.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>CNN quoted a department spokesperson stating, “Sam Brinton is no longer a DOE employee. By law, the Department of Energy cannot comment further on personnel matters.” Fox News quoted Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) stating, “when people are appointed to critical positions with important national security responsibilities, Americans must be confident they can be trusted. The department must launch a thorough investigation into the vetting process. They have to respond to legitimate oversight inquiries. It’s in our national security interest.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) <a href="https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1601223377988902912?s=20&amp;t=NaHWx4jfWoCaTRB3kdOP5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that “a person clearly unfit for a high-level national security role was hired because the Admin prioritizes wokeness over competence.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Brinton’s larceny charges have been covered far more in right rated outlets, with Brinton’s non-binary identity a frequent focus of coverage.</p>
