Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>After the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI concluded that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself and there is no “client list,” many media outlets and prominent voices from both the right and left have remained skeptical - sometimes pointing the finger at each other.</p>

<p><strong>MAGA Becomes The ‘Deep State’:</strong> An opinion by Chris Cillizza for <a href="/news-source/daily-beast-media-bias">The Daily Beast (Left)</a> took the DOJ and FBI’s conclusions at face value and described Republicans and Trump supporters who were skeptical of the Epstein files over the years as conspiracy theorists. Cillizza argued, “This is what happens when the dog catches the car. Or, to put a finer point on it, when you and the people around you become the very “Deep State” you have spent years attacking.”</p>

<p><strong>‘The Left’ Pivots: </strong>Scott McKay of <a href="/news-source/spectator-world-media-bias">The Spectator (Right)</a> wrote in an opinion, “The Left, which is a collection of people with very little interest in Epstein’s pedo ring when it was obvious a bunch of their heroes and financial backers were involved, have now come out of the woodwork to claim that the reason for the demurral by Attorney General Pam Bondi and others is that Trump himself was on the Epstein list.” McKay said he doesn’t believe that to be the case because the Democrats would have used it for political leverage in 2016 instead of the “idiotic” Steele dossier, and that “Trump and his people now recognize… the amount of collateral damage you get from outing Mossad in the Epstein case quickly becomes more than anybody can bear.”</p>

<p><strong>Common Ground:</strong> Prominent influencers and journalists have also expressed skepticism toward the DOJ and FBI’s conclusions. <a href="/news-source/tucker-carlson-media-bias">Tucker Carlson (Right)</a>, in a podcast episode where he spoke with Breaking Points host <a href="/news-source/saagar-enjeti-media-bias">Saagar Enjeti (Center)</a>, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/tucker-carlson-epstein-pam-bondi-cover-up-b2785132.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, “The current DOJ under Pam Bondi is covering up crimes, very serious crimes by their own description. Why are they doing that?” <a href="/news-source/cenk-uygur-media-bias">Cenk Uygur (Left)</a> <a href="https://x.com/cenkuygur/status/1943037079900049718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, “I agree with Tucker Carlson, that it's strange that the neocon crowd, like Mark Levin, are very quiet about the Epstein files. They don't seem as outraged as the rest of Trump voters.” <a href="/news-source/glenn-greenwald-media-bias">Glenn Greenwald (Center)</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYm6zp6QtyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, of President Trump’s downplaying of the Epstein skepticism, “How anyone who is a Trump supporter can listen to that and not feel completely condescended to and devalued and ignored is something I’ll never understand.”</p>
