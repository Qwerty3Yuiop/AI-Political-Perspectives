Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Several popular American right-wing influencers were unknowingly part of a Russian influence operation, the US Department of Justice claims.</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>In an unsealed <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1366266/dl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indictment</a>, the DOJ says a Tennessee-based media company received $10 million from the Kremlin-funded state media outlet <a href="/news-source/rt">RT (Lean Right bias)</a>. Media outlets have reported the company is <a href="https://www.tenetmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenet Media</a>, which lists personalities like <a href="/news-source/tim-pool-media-bias">Tim Pool (Lean Right bias)</a>, Benny Johnson, and Dave Rubin as its “talent.” According to the indictment, the influencers were fooled by the company’s founders, Liam Donovan and his conservative influencer wife, Lauren Chen.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The DOJ also sanctioned 10 employees of RT, including editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, and seized 32 internet domains.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> Tim Pool <a href="https://x.com/Timcast/status/1831473189173731589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a>, “Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims… Never at any point did anyone other than I have full editorial control of the show.” Benny Johnson <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1831443521603301497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he was pitched an independent contractor deal a year ago and that the deal was “later terminated.” He added, “We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> <a href="/news-source/zerohedge-media-bias">ZeroHedge (Lean Right bias)</a> focused much of its coverage on Chen’s role in the scheme and X discourse about her. <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Lean Left bias) </a>mentioned that she appeared in many of Tenet’s videos and is associated with <a href="/news-source/turning-point-usa-media-bias">Turning Point USA (Right bias)</a> and RT.</p>
