The organization highlighted a five-fold increase over the past month, which saw cases rising from about 38,000 cases in the week ending July 22&nbsp;to nearly 204,000 in the week ending Aug. 26,&nbsp;when children&nbsp;made up&nbsp;22.4% of all reported cases.&nbsp;Burbio, a data service monitoring&nbsp;the reopening trends of K-12 school districts, found that <a href="https://cai.burbio.com/school-opening-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 1,000 schools across 35&nbsp;states have closed due to a rising number of COVID-19&nbsp;cases</a> since the beginning of the school year.</p>

<p>Despite <a href="/story/perspectives-schools-families-face-challenging-return-classroom">concerns regarding these numbers and the contagious Delta variant</a>, mask mandates in schools have persistently generated polarizing opinions in school board meetings and&nbsp;state legislatures across the country. <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/354203/parents-divided-mask-mandates-school.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a Gallup poll</a>, 48% of K-12 parents believe that all students should be required to wear masks at school regardless of their vaccination status.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/08/31/montana-becomes-latest-state-to-restrict-school-mask-mandates---heres-the-full-list/?sh=720940da44a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There are currently 10 states restricting school&nbsp;mask mandates</a>;&nbsp;five are being <a href="/story/education-department-investigation-mask-mandates-ban">investigated by the&nbsp;U.S. Department of Education</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;“putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve.”&nbsp;</p>
