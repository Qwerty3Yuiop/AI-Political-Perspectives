</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee released a statement calling on President Joe Biden to declassify information regarding a “serious national security threat.”</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/HouseIntel/status/1757805804885823775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a statement released Wednesday</a>, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner (R-OH) said, “Today, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has made available to all Members of Congress information concerning a serious national security threat.” Turner added, “I am requesting that President Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat.” <a href="/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias">NBC News (Lean Left bias)</a> quoted an unnamed Democratic source stating, “This is a serious issue that could lead to a destabilizing situation and a national security threat.” A statement from House Intelligence ranking member Jim Himes (D-CT) called the threat “significant” but “not a cause for panic.”</p>

<p><strong>Details: </strong>When asked about Turner’s statement, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters he plans to meet with congressional leadership regarding the threat, adding that he was surprised by Turner’s decision to make a statement regarding the threat ahead of the meeting. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) stressed to reporters at the Capitol that “there is no need for public alarm,” adding, “We are going to work together to address this matter, as we do all sensitive matters that are classified.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Outlets across the spectrum linked the threat to Russia and included quotations from lawmakers and federal officials urging against panic.</p>

<p><em>Update 4:00 P.M. EST: <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> reported that the threat pertains to "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/14/us/politics/intelligence-russia-nuclear.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia’s attempts to develop a space-based antisatellite nuclear weapon</a>" that could be used against satellites.</em></p>
