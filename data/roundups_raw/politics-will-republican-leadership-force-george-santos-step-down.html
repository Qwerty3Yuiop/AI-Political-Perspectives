Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Following reports that incoming Representative George Santos (R-NY) <a href="/story/politics-who-incoming-gop-rep-george-santos">fabricated multiple parts of his résumé and personal background</a>, writers across the spectrum are speculating how Republican leadership will respond and questioning what the scandal reveals about the modern political system. <a href="/story/politics-ny-congressman-elect-george-santos-admits-lying-about-r-sum">Santos admitted to lying about his past</a>, but insisted it would not stop him from taking office.</p>

<p><strong>From the Left: </strong>A writer in CNN Opinion expressed hope Republican leadership will denounce Santos and pressure him to step down, determining, “and at some point, principles have to trump power.” The writer asked, “why should the public trust anything further [Santos] says, given his egregious pattern of lying, dissembling and then downplaying his own lies?”</p>

<p><strong>From the Center: </strong>Matt Lewis does not expect Santos to be punished by Republican leadership, stating that the character of Santos fits into the modern, post-Trump GOP. Lewis writes that “today’s MAGA party is the natural home of reprobates, charlatans, and grifters. In this regard, Santos—who still seems likely to be sworn in next month—will fit right in.”</p>

<p><strong>From the Right:</strong> <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek (Center Bias)</a> published an article from Jeff Mayhugh (Not Rated), who failed to secure the republican nomination for Virginia’s 10th congressional district in the 2022 midterms. Mayhugh compared the experience and struggles in his campaign with Santos, determining that candidates are pressured into embellishment and lies by the elitist forces of the modern political system, stating, “Santos's lies exposed a much deeper rot in our political system.”</p>
