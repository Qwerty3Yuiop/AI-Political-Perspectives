Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><strong>President Joe Biden appeared on 60 Minutes</strong> Sunday and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/president-joe-biden-60-minutes-video-2022-09-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made</a> a number of notable comments about hot-button issues.</p>

<p>Among them was his remark that though the U.S. still has "a problem with Covid," the "<strong>pandemic is over.</strong>" When asked what he could do "better and faster" to combat the <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-inflation-rose-more-expected-august">high inflation rate</a>, Biden said that "for the last several months, <strong>it hasn't spiked, it is just barely, it's been basically even.</strong>" He said former President Donald Trump was&nbsp;“totally irresponsible” for keeping classified documents at his Florida estate. He also said the U.S. would <strong>defend and send troops to Taiwan</strong> in the event of an "unprecedented attack" from China. And when asked about possibly <strong>running for president again in 2024</strong>, Biden <a href="/story/if-not-biden-which-democrats-could-run-president-2024">reaffirmed</a> his "intention" to run, but said his final decision "remains to be seen."</p>

<p><strong>News sources across the political spectrum</strong> covered the interview, and many highlighted Biden's remarks about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and his potential 2024 presidential campaign. Some left-rated outlets, such as <a href="/news-source/npr-media-bias">NPR </a>and <a href="/news-source/guardian">The Guardian (Lean Left bias)</a>, contrasted Biden's pandemic remark with data about ongoing COVID-19&nbsp;case count and deaths. Some right-rated outlets instead highlighted Biden's remarks on inflation; Fox Business said Biden "attempted to downplay the U.S. inflation crisis." One <a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review (Right bias) </a>writer <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/on-60-minutes-president-biden-admits-his-student-loan-order-is-illegal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that Biden saying&nbsp;the pandemic is over shows that his student loan forgiveness order is illegal because it "rested entirely upon there being an ongoing emergency."</p>
