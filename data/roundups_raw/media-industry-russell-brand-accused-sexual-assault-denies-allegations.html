</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>British actor, comedian, and commentator Russell Brand is facing sexual assault allegations, which he denies.</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>A <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russell-brand-rape-sexual-assault-abuse-allegations-investigation-v5hxdlmb6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint investigation</a> which British publications <a href="/news-source/times-media-bias">The Times (Center bias)</a> and Channel 4 Dispatches claim began in 2019 alleges Brand sexually assaulted four different women between 2006 and 2013 when he worked as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4. Brand, who has recently become known for his political commentary through his <a href="https://rumble.com/russellbrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a>, Stay Free with Russell Brand, denied the allegations.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Brand was notably married to pop star Katy Perry from 2010 to 2011, and says he’s previously opened up about his substance and sex addictions in his books. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stay-free-with-russell-brand/id1648125917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent guests</a> on Brand’s Stay Free podcast include <a href="/news-source/candace-owens-media-bias">Candace Owens (Right bias)</a>, <a href="/news-source/briahna-joy-gray-media-bias">Briahna Joy Gray (Left bias)</a>, <a href="/news-source/bari-weiss-media-bias">Bari Weiss (Center bias)</a>, <a href="/news-source/glenn-greenwald-media-bias">Glenn Greenwald (Center bias)</a>, and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote:</strong> A few hours before the investigation was published, Brand released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RussellBrand/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video statement</a>, in which he denied the claims. Brand said he was “very, very promiscuous” in his past, but relationships “were absolutely always consensual.” He added that he feels “like there’s a serious and concerted agenda” behind the allegations.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> The story was widely covered across the spectrum, particularly by British outlets. <a href="/news-source/telegraph-uk">The Telegraph UK (Lean Right bias)</a> described Brand’s statement as “posted on a channel where he has made a number of anti-vaccination claims.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/sep/17/a-timeline-of-sexual-assault-allegations-against-russell-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British</a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12526869/Four-women-four-disturbing-claims-shocking-dossier-allegations-against-comedian-Russell-Brand.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlets</a> more often framed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66831593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">headlines</a> around the accusations, while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/17/arts/russell-brand-sexual-assault-allegations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/entertainment/2023/09/17/russell-brand-sexual-assault-allegations-response-cnntmw-contd-vpx.cnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlets</a> more often framed <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/comedian-russell-brand-denies-allegations-sexual-assault-published-103251071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">them</a> around Brand’s denial.</p>
