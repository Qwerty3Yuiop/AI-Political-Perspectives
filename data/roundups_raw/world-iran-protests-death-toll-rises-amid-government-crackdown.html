Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><strong>Protests in Iran continued into their second week</strong> following <a href="/story/world-fatalities-rise-iran-protests-continue-over-death-22-year-old">the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini</a> in police custody.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“At least 76 protesters are confirmed to have been killed by security forces,”</strong> non-governmental organization Iran Human Rights <a href="https://iranhr.net/en/articles/5500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Monday. However, Iranian state media said only 41 had been killed, including security personnel. Hundreds have been arrested, including at least <a href="https://cpj.org/2022/09/iran-arrests-at-least-20-journalists-amid-nationwide-anti-government-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 journalists</a>. Antigovernment protesters have criticized Iran’s so-called “morality police” and hijab laws, but some pro-government rallies pushed back against purported <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/25/iran-organises-counter-demonstrations-as-protests-continue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“norm-breaking”</a> behavior. While Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi pledged to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/25/iran-vows-decisive-action-as-mahsa-amini-protests-continue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“decisively”</a> deal with the protests, <a href="/story/joe-biden-biden-condemns-russia-pledges-29-billion-global-food-aid-un-speech">U.S. President Joe Biden praised</a> “the brave women of Iran, who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.”</p>

<p><strong>The Iranian government restricted internet access, </strong>but the U.S. <a href="/news/2022-09-23-1116/technology-treasury-department-helps-expand-internet-access-iranian-people-amid">changed sanctions rules</a> to allow businesses to provide internet access to the country. Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite service moved to offer uncensored access in Iran, but an <a href="/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias">Al Jazeera (Lean Left bias)</a> analyst <a href="/news/2022-09-27-1111/technology-why-elon-musk-s-starlink-will-not-affect-protests-iran">doubted</a> the move’s efficacy due to the lack of Starlink terminals in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Coverage was mostly balanced and widespread across the spectrum,</strong> particularly in international outlets like <a href="/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias">BBC News (Center bias)</a> and Al Jazeera. Coverage was somewhat less common in right-rated outlets, which tend to focus more on U.S. issues.&nbsp;</p>
