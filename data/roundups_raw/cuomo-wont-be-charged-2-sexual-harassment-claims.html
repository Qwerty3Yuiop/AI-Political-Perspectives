Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A prosecutor announced Tuesday that former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will not face criminal charges in connection with two of the sexual harassment allegations against him.</p>

<p>The top prosecutor in Westchester County, New York&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/WestchesterDA/status/1475914979119452161/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;that their investigation "found credible evidence" that both incidents occurred and that Cuomo's conduct was concerning, but also that their office&nbsp;couldn't "pursue criminal charges due to the statutory requirements" of New York criminal law. The federal government and&nbsp;two other county district attorneys are still probing sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo, who was also&nbsp;charged with misdemeanor forcible touching in Albany County after <a href="/story/andrew-cuomo-accuser-brittany-commisso-comes-forward">an executive assistant said&nbsp;he groped her</a> while she was working at the Executive Mansion. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-charges-case.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reported</a> earlier this month that nearly four in 10 forcible touching cases are dismissed or dropped each year in New York. Cuomo <a href="/story/cuomo-resigns-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations">resigned as governor in August</a> amid multiple harassment claims.<br />

	Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight the specifics of the&nbsp;allegations more prominently than left-rated sources. Some headlines from right-rated sources, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/district-attorney-no-charges-against-cuomo-over-sexual-allegations-despite-credible-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as the Daily Wire (Right bias)</a>, focused on how criminal charges wouldn't be pursued against Cuomo "despite 'credible evidence.'"&nbsp;Bias was also evident in photo choice, with some right-rated outlets using images of Cuomo smirking or <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/westchester-county-no-charges-cuomo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making strange facial expressions</a>&nbsp;(Fox News, Right).⁠</p>
