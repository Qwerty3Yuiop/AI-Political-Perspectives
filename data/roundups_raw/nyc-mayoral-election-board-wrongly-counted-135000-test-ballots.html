Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>New York City's Board of Elections (BOE) said Tuesday evening that there was a "discrepancy" in its calculation of ranked-choice votes, and that 135,000 test ballot&nbsp;images had been included in the count. The board said it removed the test votes and will re-upload the correct election results Wednesday evening. After election day last week,&nbsp;Brooklyn Borough President&nbsp;Eric Adams had nearly 32% of the vote,&nbsp;while Maya Wiley, former counsel to current Mayor Bill de Blasio, had 22%. Tuesday's update, which has since been removed, showed&nbsp;Adams was at&nbsp;51.1%, while former sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia held 48.9%.&nbsp;The Tuesday update also excluded around 125,000 absentee ballots, which will be counted next week.&nbsp;Adams&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1410073173660508163/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement</a>, "It is critical that New Yorkers are confident in their electoral system, especially as we rank votes in a citywide election for the first time."&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mayawiley/status/1410080652498722818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1410080652498722818%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalreview.com%2Fnews%2Fnyc-elections-board-calls-for-patience-amid-discrepancy-in-mayoral-primary-results%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiley called the mistake</a>&nbsp;"the result of generations of failures that have gone unaddressed.”</p>

<p>The story received wide coverage from across the spectrum. <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/new-york-city-election-debacle-further-undermines-confidence-in-elections-150440385.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some outlets</a> pointed to the mistake as an example of wider problems with the U.S.&nbsp;election system and highlighted some Americans' lack of faith in it.&nbsp;</p>
