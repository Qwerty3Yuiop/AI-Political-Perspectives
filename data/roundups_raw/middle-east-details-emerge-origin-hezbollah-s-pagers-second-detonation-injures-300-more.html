Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>More details are emerging on the apparent Israeli attack against Hezbollah, in which it wounded nearly 3,000 by remotely detonating pagers.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack, though due to its targeting and complexity, many pundits across the spectrum believe it is responsible. On Wednesday afternoon, a second wave of detonations injured more than 300 and killed nine.</p>

<p><strong>Supply Chain Infiltration:</strong> <a href="/news-source/wall-street-journal-media-bias">The Wall Street Journal (Center bias)</a> reported that many of the compromised pagers were received in a recent shipment as Hezbollah aimed to update its devices. The Journal cited “people familiar with Hezbollah’s investigation” as saying the pagers had explosive devices planted in them during what they believe was Israeli tampering.</p>

<p><strong>Made In Hungary:</strong> The pagers, which resembled a model from the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, said the pagers were manufactured “entirely” by the Budapest-based BAC Consulting. Gold Apollo said BAC has been selling their pagers for less than two years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shell Company:</strong> Records <a href="https://www.ceginformacio.hu/cr9312263144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available online</a> indicate BAC was registered in Hungary in mid-2022. <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">The Associated Press (Lean Left bias) </a>reported that journalists went to the company’s address, which hosts various companies, and a woman “emerged from the building and declined to give her name.” BAC is registered to Cristiana Rosaria Bársony-Arcidiacono whose <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristiana-b%C3%A0rsony-arcidiacono-phd/?originalSubdomain=hu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> says she has been the CEO since 2019.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Several outlets across the spectrum covered the developments, offering context on Gold Apollo and BAC. The Associated Press wrote that BAC “appeared to be a shell company.”</p>
