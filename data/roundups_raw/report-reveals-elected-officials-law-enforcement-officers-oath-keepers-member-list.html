Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><strong>The Anti-Defamation League released a <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/oath-keepers-data-leak-unmasking-extremism-public-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a></strong> on Tuesday constructed from a leaked membership log of the far-right group, the <a href="/tags/oath-keepers?search=oath%20keepers">Oath Keepers</a>. In the report, the ADL compared the membership log with public records, finding hundreds of U.S. public officials, including elected officials, law enforcement officers, and soldiers, included on the list.</p>

<p>The leaked list contained no information regarding the level of involvement of the listed names. <strong>Many named officials and officers contacted by the Associated Press denied significant involvement</strong> with the group and claimed to have not had meaningful ties to the organization in years or ever. The ADL included this possibility in their report, stating that listed members could have been “sold a watered-down version of the group, and some may have disavowed the group since signing up.”</p>

<p>The Oath Keepers were founded in 2009, but are now most <strong>known for their involvement in the January 6 Capitol Riot</strong> in 2021, in which the group played a role. In January, the founder of the group, Stewart Rhodes, along with ten others <a href="/news/2022-01-13-1226/oath-keepers-leader-indicted-charges-related-jan-6">were charged</a> with seditious conspiracy for their actions at the Capitol. More recently, A lawyer for the Oath Keepers was <a href="/news/2022-09-01-1033/us-charges-oath-keepers-lawyer-jan-6-conspiracy-obstruction">charged</a> with obstruction of justice and conspiracy also in connection to January 6.</p>

<p>The report was covered moderately by left rated outlets and largely ignored by the right. The Associated Press included the most responses from listed individuals.&nbsp;</p>
