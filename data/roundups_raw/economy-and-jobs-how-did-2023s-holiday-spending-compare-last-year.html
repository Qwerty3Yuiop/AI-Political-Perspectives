Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>U.S. retail sales rose 3.1% year-over-year between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24, according to <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/spendingpulse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data</a> from Mastercard.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>Experts reportedly expected annual growth of 3.7%. The data is not adjusted for inflation. Spending at restaurants (up 7.8%) and on apparel (up 2.4%) rose steadily, while spending on jewelry (down 2%)&nbsp;and electronics (down 0.4%)&nbsp;fell.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>In the same period last year, spending rose 7.6% from the year before.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Media across the spectrum covered the question very differently. Many left-rated sources highlighted how&nbsp;spending was up, and framed it as a positive sign for Biden’s economy. Many right-rated outlets and some in the center like <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek</a> focused on how the year-over-year spending growth was 3.1%, compared to an annual&nbsp;jump of 7.6% from 2021 to 2022, and framed that as evidence of inflation's toll on consumers. Few&nbsp;on the left emphasized&nbsp;that comparison to the same extent. <a href="/news-source/abc-news-media-bias">ABC News (Lean Left bias)</a> said, "Robust spending during the holidays appears to have dispelled concern among some economists of a decline." <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right bias)</a> said, "Inflation-battered shoppers cut back on their holiday spending this year — opening their wallets mainly for 'big deals,'&nbsp;according to industry experts and newly released figures." Newsweek said, "Despite Americans' strategic spending this holiday season, a large number drew in spending as inflationary pressures made many gifts and celebrations out of reach."</p>
