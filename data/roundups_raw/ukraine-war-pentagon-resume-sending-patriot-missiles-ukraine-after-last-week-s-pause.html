Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Donald Trump has announced that the US will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, a reversal from last week’s decision to halt sending certain weapons, including Patriot missiles, to the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>Trump made the comments Monday evening before a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Lean Left bias)</a> reported that Trump’s national security team plans to discuss the specifics on Tuesday and will be including Patriot missiles in the shipments.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Russia has ramped up its attacks on Ukraine over the last week, launching what media are calling its largest aerial attack yet of nearly 500 drones and 60 missiles. Late last week, Trump had phone calls with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said his call with Zelenskyy was “very good” and that he was “very disappointed” with the conversation between him and Putin.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> Trump told reporters, “Defensive weapons, primarily, but they’re getting hit very, very hard. So many people are dying in that mess. We’re going to send some more weapons.” He added, “We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now.” Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “Obviously, the Europeans are actively involved in pumping Ukraine full of weapons. As for what kind of supplies and in what quantity Ukraine continues to receive from the United States, it will still take time to clarify this definitively.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> CNN highlghted the importance of Patriot missiles to Ukraine and noted they “are the only system that can intercept certain Russian missiles that have been raining on Ukraine and causing loss of life amid an intensifying assault by Moscow.” <a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias">The Hill (Center)</a> emphasized the weapons to be sent are “defensive.” <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right)</a> noted unrest within Russia that included the “apparent suicide” of its transport minister, who was recently dismissed by Putin, and the grounding of hundreds of flights.</p>
