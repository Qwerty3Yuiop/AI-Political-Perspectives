Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A report from the Department of Justice concluded the Louisville Metro Police Department engages in civil rights violations and racial discrimination.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1573011/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The report concludes</a> the Louisville Metro Police Department uses “excessive force,” “conducts searches based on invalid warrants,” “unlawfully executes search warrants without knocking and announcing,” “unlawfully stops, searches, detains, and arrests people,” “unlawfully discriminates against Black people,” and “violates the rights of people engaged in protected speech critical of policing.” Attorney General Merrick Garland concluded that “this conduct is unacceptable. It is heartbreaking. It erodes the community trust necessary for effective policing, and it is an affront to the people of Louisville, who deserve better.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The probe was conducted in response to an incident in 2020 where Louisville police officers executed a no-knock narcotics warrant at the home of Breonna Taylor, entering the residence with a battering ram after midnight. Taylor’s boyfriend reportedly believed the officers were intruders and fired at them, hitting one officer in the leg. The officers returned fire and Taylor was shot and killed. No drugs were found in the house, and a former officer later pleaded guilty to falsifying information on the warrant.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>The release of the report was covered across the spectrum. Reason Magazine noted that police misconduct investigations have increased under President Biden, after being halted during the Trump Administration. The Associated Press noted other reforms following Taylor’s killing, such as a ban on no-knock warrants in the city.</p>
