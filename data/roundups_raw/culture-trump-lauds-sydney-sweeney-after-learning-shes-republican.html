Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>In light of actress <a href="/story/arts-and-entertainment-sydney-sweeneys-american-eagle-ad-sparks-eugenics-debate">Sydney Sweeney’s “Great Jeans” ad campaign for American Eagle</a>, reports have surfaced that she is a registered Republican, drawing praise from President Donald Trump.</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>Sweeney registered to vote in Florida on June 24, 2024, shortly after she purchased a home there, and listed her party affiliation as Republican, according to publicly available records.</p>

<p><strong>To Reporters: </strong>When a reporter asked Trump his thoughts on her political affiliation, he said, “She's a registered Republican? Oh, now I love her ad.” He added, “You'd be surprised at how many people are Republicans. That's what I wouldn't have known, but I'm glad you told me that. If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”</p>

<p><strong>On Truth Social:</strong> Trump later <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114970952739677687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there. It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.’ Go get ‘em Sydney! On the other side of the ledger, Jaguar did a stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement, THAT IS A TOTAL DISASTER!” He added, “Or just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift… She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT. The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Some have criticized the ad as <a href="/story/arts-and-entertainment-sydney-sweeneys-american-eagle-ad-sparks-eugenics-debate">resembling “Nazi propaganda” or promoting eugenics</a>. Sweeney, who has blonde hair and blue eyes, is best known for her roles in shows like Euphoria and The White Lotus. In May, Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114517718765768352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’ American Eagle’s stock rose in the midst of Sweeney’s campaign, and jumped another 14 points after President Trump’s remarks.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>The story was widely covered across the spectrum. <a href="/news-source/guardian">The Guardian (Left bias)</a> noted Sweeney’s registration came “about two weeks after Trump, another registered Republican Florida voter, was convicted in New York City of criminal falsification of business records.” The Guardian also included, “It was also about two years after Sweeney, 27, faced criticism from some US media consumers after she was photographed at her mother’s birthday party where several of the guests were seen wearing hats that called to mind those which bear Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ (Maga) slogan.”</p>
