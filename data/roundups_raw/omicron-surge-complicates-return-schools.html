Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>While most U.S. schools returned to in-person learning after the holidays, <a href="https://cai.burbio.com/school-opening-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands of&nbsp;schools</a>&nbsp;delayed their&nbsp;classroom plans because of the&nbsp;Omicron variant.</p>

<p>COVID-19 cases grew rapidly over the holidays, reaching <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/france-relaxes-quarantine-rules-as-europe-adapts-to-omicrons-spread-11641217097?mod=hp_lead_pos3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">record highs</a> of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 400,000</a>&nbsp;daily cases. Several school districts in cities like <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/588004-milwaukee-schools-shifting-classes-online-as-more-staffers-test-positive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a> switched to virtual learning, often citing shortages of substitute teachers and bus drivers. Coverage in several outlets focused on New York City, where <a href="https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2022/01/02/adams-to-parents-fear-not-sending-kids-back-to-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayor Eric Adams</a> rejected efforts by the United Federation of Teachers to keep schools closed amid one of the nation’s worst outbreaks. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/us/chicago-schools-remote-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Teachers Union</a> also drove headlines with its planned vote&nbsp;to walk out on Wednesday. On Sunday, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20220102171403-secretary-of-education-miguel-cardona-on-face-the-nation/#x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Education Secretary Miguel Cardona</a> said that “students belong in the classroom,” and that&nbsp;“we can do it safely.”</p>

<p>News and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/dont-let-teachers-unions-shut-down-schools-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opinion</a> coverage from the right tended to speak favorably of officials who kept schools open. Some outlets, including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/03/1069907437/officials-are-determined-to-keep-schools-open-despite-omicron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR (Center)</a> and the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/education/article/Omicron-is-surging-but-Houston-students-headed-16744757.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Houston Chronicle (Center)</a>, used words like “despite” and “but” to seemingly frame the Omicron outbreak as a valid reason to close schools.</p>
