Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Joe Biden's remark that U.S. troops stationed in Poland are&nbsp;training Ukrainian forces to defend against <a href="/blog/live-blog-daily-russia-ukraine-updates">Russia's invasion</a> was contradicted&nbsp;by other U.S. officials. So, what's actually happening?<br />
	<br />
	On Monday, Biden<a href="/news/2022-03-29-1002/president-biden-appears-reveal-us-troops-training-ukrainian-forces-poland"> implied that he talked to U.S. troops</a> "about helping train the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland."&nbsp;On Tuesday, a&nbsp;Pentagon spokesperson said U.S. troops were "liasing" with Ukrainian forces in Poland, but "not training in the classic sense that many people think of training." The&nbsp;head of U.S. European Command also said he doesn't believe "we are in the process of currently training military forces from Ukraine in Poland." When asked about the comment, the White House communications director said she couldn't add further detail, "except to say that there is regular interaction" between U.S. and Ukrainian troops. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suggested later Monday that Biden may have revealed "classified secrets on national television."<br />
	<br />
	Right-rated sources, and some on the left like&nbsp;Politico (Lean Left bias), often <a href="/news/2022-03-30-1556/us-training-ukrainian-troops-poland-biden-seems-reveal">framed Biden's remark as a gaffe</a>. Some on the right wondered if Biden was misinformed, misspoke, or if he revealed a military secret, and argued that any of those would be evidence of dysfunction&nbsp;and <a href="/news/2022-03-30-1558/head-us-european-command-actually-we-re-not-training-ukrainians-biden-said">Biden's inability to navigate the conflict</a>. One report from CNN moved to clarify Biden's comment, and focused on anonymous sources who said that U.S.&nbsp;troops in Poland are&nbsp;instructing Ukrainians on how to use weapons that the West sent to&nbsp;Ukraine.</p>
