Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><strong>The Iranian government is cracking down on civil unrest stemming from the recent death of Kurdish 22-year-old Mahsa Amini</strong>, who died in custody after being arrested by Iranian Morality Police for a dress code violation. While figures are scattered and some unconfirmed, reports indicate at least nine people have been killed during clashes between protestors and the state.</p>

<p><strong>Protests are ongoing across the country</strong>, but have been concentrated in Iran’s northwestern cities, where the state’s Kurdish minorities are most prevalent. In response to the unrest, Iranian authorities have limited accessibility to internet services in an attempt to silence information spread and hamper coordination of demonstrations. The government’s response led many outlets to draw connections to protests seen in the country in 2019. Those protests, which were sparked by rising fuel prices and economic turmoil, left over 1,500 people dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Iranian authorities have denied responsibility for the deaths in recent clashes</strong>, pinning the blame on armed dissidents. Additionally, they have denied blame for the death of Amini, whom they claim had preexisting health issues and fell into a coma during her arrest. Amini’s family has denied the state’s claim, stating she did not have health issues and citing evidence of her having been beaten before being taken to the hospital, where she died.</p>

<p>Coverage of the ongoing protests has been consistent across the spectrum since the incident occurred last week.&nbsp;</p>
