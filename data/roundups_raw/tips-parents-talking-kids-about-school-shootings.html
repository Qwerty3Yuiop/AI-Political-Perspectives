Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The country's response to the <a href="/story/who-or-whats-blame-school-shootings">latest U.S. school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas</a> involves tough questions about <a href="/story/how-should-lawmakers-attempt-prevent-future-mass-shootings">laws and rights</a>, but also about how to talk to children about guns and violence at schools.<br />
	<br />
	Since 1966, there have been 13 school shootings in the U.S. "in which four or more victims are murdered with at least one of those homicides taking place in a public location" and "with no connection to underlying criminal activity," according to an <a href="/news/2022-05-26-0628/what-we-know-about-mass-school-shootings-and-shooters-us">analysis from The Conversation (Lean Left bias)</a>. In those shootings,&nbsp;146 people were killed and at least 182 injured, excluding the shooters. The three deadliest have happened in the past decade:&nbsp;2012’s Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Connecticut, when&nbsp;26 children and school staff were killed; 2018's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, in which&nbsp;17 people were killed; and Tuesday's shooting, when&nbsp;at least 19 children and two adults were killed.<br />
	<br />
	News sources across the political spectrum highlighted tips for parents when talking to their children. Many emphasized listening, patience, and awareness of kids' social media consumption as key virtues.&nbsp;Some sources from left to right showed differences in which resources and responses they recommended. One NPR article highlighted a list of resources from the American School Counselor Association, and suggested encouraging kids to take action "in initiatives to address gun violence." Another Fox News&nbsp;article&nbsp;emphasized how parents should "be the trusted source" of information, and suggested encouraging kids to pray and be resilient.&nbsp;</p>
