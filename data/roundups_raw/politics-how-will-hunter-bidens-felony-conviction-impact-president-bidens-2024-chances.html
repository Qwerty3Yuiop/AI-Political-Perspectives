Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Voices across the spectrum are reflecting on the impact of Hunter Biden’s felony convictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> On Tuesday, President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was <a href="/story/justice-hunter-biden-convicted-3-felony-charges-federal-gun-trial" target="_blank">convicted of three felony charges</a> for lying about his drug use to purchase a gun, submitting a false statement into a federal record, and unlawfully possessing a firearm.</p>

<p><strong>From the Left: </strong>A <a href="/news-source/daily-beast-media-bias" target="_blank">Daily Beast (Left bias)</a> writer stated that Hunter Biden “can and will only blame himself for his conviction,” but added, “we have Attorney General Merrick Garland to thank for the fact the case was brought, and that it was tried in the politically explosive time of a presidential campaign.” Garland’s “obsession” with the Justice Department appearing above partisan politics has led him “to favor extreme change. That extreme change is in the political stability of our democracy,” determining, “The Hunter Biden prosecutions are yet another example of the consequences of Garland’s approach to leading the DOJ.”</p>

<p><strong>From the Right: </strong>A writer in the <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner" target="_blank">Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)</a> argued the most important moment in the trial was when “President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice admitted in court and under oath that the laptop linking Hunter Biden to payments from foreign governments was real.” The writer concluded, “It is going to be very hard to convince voters that some eight-year-old bookkeeping errors show Trump is unfit for office when it has just been confirmed that Biden himself participated in a conspiracy to cover up his family’s illegal financial relationships with corrupt foreign governments.”</p>
