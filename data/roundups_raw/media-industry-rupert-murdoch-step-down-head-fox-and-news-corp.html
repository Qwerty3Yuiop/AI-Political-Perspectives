Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Rupert Murdoch, at age 92, is stepping down as Chairman of Fox News and News Corp, effective in November.&nbsp;He will be <a href="https://www.foxcorporation.com/news/corp-press-releases/2023/k-rupert-murdoch-to-be-appointed-chairman-emeritus-of-fox-corporation-and-news-corp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appointed&nbsp;Chairman Emeritus</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Details</strong>:&nbsp;Murdoch's son, Lachlan Murdoch, will become Chairman of both Fox and News Corp.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>:&nbsp;"For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change," Murdoch's statement read. "But the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams and a passionate, principled leader in Lachlan who will become sole Chairman of both companies. Neither excessive pride nor false humility are admirable qualities. But I am truly proud of what we have achieved collectively through the decades, and I owe much to my colleagues, whose contributions to our success have sometimes been unseen outside the company but are deeply appreciated by me."</p>
