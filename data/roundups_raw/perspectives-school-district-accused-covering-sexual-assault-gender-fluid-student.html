Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A Virginia school district is being accused of covering up allegations that a gender fluid student sexually assaulted a female student in a school bathroom in&nbsp;May.<br />
	<br />
	The alleged victim's father, Scott Smith, says the Loudoun County School District dismissed the assault claims, and that a school counselor <a href="https://loudounnow.com/2021/10/13/parents-students-press-for-reform-in-schools-handling-of-sexual-assaults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told he and&nbsp;his wife</a> that "they’re not supposed to talk about anything." The assault suspect was reportedly arrested in July following a county sheriff's office investigation; the office says the case is "pending court proceedings," and records for juvenile&nbsp;cases are sealed. Smith was arrested at a school board meeting&nbsp;in June and found guilty of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest; the district superintendent reportedly said during that meeting that he had "no record of assaults occurring in our restrooms." The assault suspect&nbsp;was <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/multiple-sexual-assaults-dominate-public-comment-at-loudoun-school-board-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently charged</a> with a separate assault&nbsp;at a different school.<br />
	<br />
	Right-rated outlets have covered the story prominently following the Wire's report,&nbsp;and highlighted claims about the allegations from Scott's lawyer. As of Wednesday, no left-rated outlets have&nbsp;covered the news. Many right-rated voices criticized school officials, left-rated media and Democrats for purportedly ignoring the allegations to protect the transgender rights movement. Some also said Scott had been unfairly portrayed as an politically-extreme parent, and framed that narrative in the context of <a href="/story/perspectives-fbi-doj-probe-threats-against-school-officials">the FBI's recent move to investigate threats against school officials.</a></p>
