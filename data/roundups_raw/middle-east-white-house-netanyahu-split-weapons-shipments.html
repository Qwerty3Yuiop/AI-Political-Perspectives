Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The White House is disagreeing&nbsp;with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that the United States is withholding weapons from Israel and is hampering the Israeli military's ongoing offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>Key Details</strong>: According to <a href="/news-source/axios">Axios</a> (Lean Left bias) and several Hebrew media outlets, high-level talks&nbsp;in Washington, D.C., were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/19/netanyahu-video-biden-cancels-iran-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancelled</a> after Netanyahu posted a <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1803064164539081120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video&nbsp;statement</a>&nbsp;claiming the U.S. was withholding arms shipments.&nbsp;The&nbsp;White House denies these reports. While Axios cited two White House officials claiming the meeting was canceled, it also cited a third official who said the meeting was "postponed rather than canceled, due to a scheduling issue." The <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner">Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)</a>&nbsp;also <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3051217/white-house-denies-canceled-israel-meeting-netanyahu-remarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that the meeting was postponed because of scheduling issues, citing a White House official. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Netanyahu prepares to address Congress on July 24 —&nbsp;an address that many Democrats plan to boycott.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong>:&nbsp;"It's inconceivable that in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel," Netanyahu said. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said,&nbsp;"We genuinely do not know what he is talking about. We just don't,"&nbsp;adding that only&nbsp;one shipment of heavy bombs had been paused&nbsp;since the war began.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: A shipment of 3,500 bombs was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/05/israel-us-ammunition-shipment-hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put on hold</a>&nbsp;in May due to&nbsp;U.S. concerns over an imminent&nbsp;Israeli ground operation in Rafah. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his last meeting in Israel, reassured Netanyahu&nbsp;that the U.S. was working to remove bottlenecks in arms deliveries.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it</strong>: Some sources on the left noted that Netanyahu's remarks were one of his harshest public criticisms of the Biden Administration since the <a href="/story/world-hamas-launches-large-scale-attack-israel-netanyahu-declares-country-war">October 7 attack</a> on Israel by Hamas. Some sources on the right noted that the Biden administration has become increasingly&nbsp;disapproving&nbsp;of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza.&nbsp;<em>Update 6/19/24 11:49 p.m. ET: Added context on Axios' sources.</em></p>
