Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Steve Bannon, one-time advisor to former President Donald Trump, was ordered to report to prison by July 1 to serve a four-month sentence.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Bannon convicted of contempt of congress in October 2022 for refusing a subpoena to testify before a House committee investigating the Capitol riot that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. Following the conviction, the judge paused Bannon’s prison sentence until the appeals process played out. Bannon lost his appeal attempt in May. Another Trump advisor, Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of congress and began his four-month sentence in March.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>Judge Carl J. Nichols ruled, “I do not feel my original basis for Mr. Bannon’s stay exists any longer.” Following the ruling, Bannon’s lawyer continued to argue the decision, which led the judge to add, “One thing I think you need to learn as a lawyer is that when a judge has decided, you do not get up and yell at them.” Speaking outside the courtroom, Bannon declared, “This is about shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grass-roots conservatives, shutting down President Trump. There’s nothing that can shut me up.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong> <a href="/news-source/newsweek" target="_blank">Newsweek (Center bias)</a> focused coverage around right-wing backlash to the Judge’s decision, noting that many MAGA-affiliated voices, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) decried the ruling as proof of corruption in the justice system. The article concluded by noting that the judge overseeing the case was appointed by Trump.</p>
