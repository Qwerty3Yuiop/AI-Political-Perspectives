Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Law enforcement officials have&nbsp;named 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh of Hawaii as the suspect in the <a href="/story/donald-trump-trump-safe-after-apparent-assassination-attempt-florida">apparent assassination attempt</a> on former President Trump on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>The Attempt:&nbsp;</strong>Routh hid on the edge of Trump's Florida golf course for nearly 12 hours before a Secret Service agent spotted him, according to the FBI.&nbsp;The Secret Service said he never fired his weapon and never had a line of sight on Trump.</p>

<p><strong>The Suspect:</strong> Routh has&nbsp;previously been arrested for <a href="https://x.com/gekaminsky/status/1835452478986375491?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weapons violations</a>, including for "possessing weapons of mass destruction,"&nbsp;drug possession, and vehicle-related infractions. In 2002, he reportedly&nbsp;barricaded himself in an office during a three-hour standoff following a traffic stop.&nbsp;It appears Routh <a href="/news/2024-09-16-1318/donald-trump-what-we-know-about-ryan-routh-man-charged-after-apparent-trump">supported</a> Trump in 2016, but in 2020 donated to multiple Democrats.&nbsp;Facebook and X&nbsp;suspended Routh’s accounts, preventing people from seeing his previous posts.</p>

<p><strong>Pro-Ukraine Stances: </strong>Routh has&nbsp;expressed staunch support for Ukraine. In April, he reportedly expressed a desire to kill Russian President Vladimir Putin in a post directed at Elon Musk on X. In 2022, Routh ostensibly appeared in a <a href="https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/1835493731639636383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional video</a> for Ukraine’s far-right Azov Brigade, which notably has ties to Nazism. Lean Left outlets <a href="/news-source/semafor-media-bias">Semafor</a> and <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times</a>&nbsp;previously interviewed Routh about his Ukraine support.&nbsp;Ukraine's international legion <a href="/news/2024-09-16-1322/donald-trump-ukraine-distances-itself-ryan-routh-man-accused-trump">said</a> it had nothing to do with Routh, while a Kremlin spokesman <a href="/news/2024-09-16-1325/donald-trump-kremlin-says-trump-shooters-ukrainian-links-show-playing-fire-has">said</a>, "playing with fire has its consequences." &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>The story is still developing.&nbsp;The Times stopped short of confirming Routh’s alleged 2002 run-in with officials, writing that “a man with the same name and similar age” was arrested. <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> and others on the right&nbsp;framed much of their coverage around Routh's&nbsp;prior offenses.</p>
