Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en1-H2z8Ems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with ABC News&nbsp;on Friday, President Joe Biden restated his intention to run for reelection in 2024, and said that concerns over his age are "totally legitimate."</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong>: "My intention is - from - has&nbsp;been from the beginning to run," Biden said. "But there's too many other things we have to finish in the near term before I start a campaign." He added that "It’s legitimate for people to raise issues about my age. It’s totally legitimate to do that. And the only thing I can say is, 'Watch me.'" Last week, First Lady Jill Biden said her husband was <a href="/news/2023-02-24-1247/joe-biden-biden-pretty-much-ready-announce-re-election-jill-biden-says">"pretty much" ready</a> to announce his reelection campaign, and said she was "all for it."</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Biden has <a href="/story/joe-biden-joe-biden-turns-80-amid-2024-speculation">faced concerns</a> over whether he's&nbsp;fit to serve another term. He will be 82 years old&nbsp;in 2024, and would be 86 at the end of a second term. It's not the first time <a href="/blog/media-bias-alert-biden-says-age-legitimate-concern-voters">he's said the concerns are legitimate</a>.&nbsp;A recent physical exam deemed Biden fit to serve, but the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-health-evaluation-missing-mental-status-exam-medical-expert-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">results of his mental status were reportedly missing</a> from the public evaluation. Republican Nikki Haley, who is<a href="/story/elections-nikki-haley-announces-2024-presidential-run"> running for president in 2024</a>, has insisted that politicans&nbsp;over the age of 75 should take a mental competency test.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong>&nbsp;Center- and right-rated sources focused more on Biden's comments about his age.&nbsp;</p>
