Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District joined striking support staff on Tuesday, halting schooling for over 400,000 students in the district in what is currently slated to be a three-day strike.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second-largest district in the country. Local 99 of the Service Employees International Union, composed of aides, special education assistants, custodians, and other support staff workers, called for the strike. The Los Angeles Times quoted Union Executive Director Max Arias stating the support staff workers are calling for their average wage to be raised from $25,000 to $36,000. As of Saturday, the district’s offer reportedly included a 23% raise over three years, a 3% bonus for qualified staff members, more full-time positions, and increased healthcare access.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) voiced support for the striking workers, stating, “people with some of the most important responsibilities in our schools should not have to live in poverty.” The New York Post quoted a special education assistant in the district saying, “the working conditions have gone down every year. We’re very understaffed. The custodial staff is a ghost crew, so the schools are dirty. They’re doing the best they can.” Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho said the strike “could have been avoided,” alleging the union members refused to negotiate.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Outlets across the spectrum are covering the ongoing strike. The New York Post did not mention the three-day time frame on the strike.</p>
