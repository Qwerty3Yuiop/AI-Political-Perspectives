</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Mortgage rates are at their highest level in months as the spring home-buying season approaches.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong>&nbsp;The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage loan rose to 6.94% from 6.9% this week, the highest point since December,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Freddie Mac</a>.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>After hitting a 20-year high of 7.79% in October, mortgage rates fell slowly&nbsp;and remained around 6.6% for more than a month. They&nbsp;began to creep&nbsp;higher after&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-federal-reserve-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged">Federal Reserve said it wouldn't reduce its benchmark interest rate</a>&nbsp;until later this year.
