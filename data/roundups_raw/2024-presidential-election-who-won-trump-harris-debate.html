Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Media outlets and pundits weighed in on who won last night's presidential debate in Philadelphia.</p>

<p><strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong>: The <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">New York Times</a> (Lean Left bias)&nbsp;concluded that Harris succeeded in provoking Trump into veering off message, particularly when Harris suggested Trump's rallies were boring and when she mentioned Trump's criminal conviction and legal issues. <a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review</a> (Right bias) reported that Harris won the presidential debate, but that ABC assisted her by not fact-checking her during the debate while they fact-checked Trump about five times.&nbsp;Some pundits concluded Harris did not have convincing reasons for why her positions had changed on some economic issues.</p>

<p><strong>Former President Donald Trump</strong>: Some media outlets noted Trump's statement that the withdrawal of the U.S. from Afghanistan resulted&nbsp;in equipment and resources being left behind, and Harris did not respond to the&nbsp;moderator's question on whether she felt responsible. He also reminded voters that Harris&nbsp;had supported fracking, and defunding the police. Trump also may have scored points when he pointed out that even with critics saying his tariffs&nbsp;would raise prices, he had low inflation when he was president. <a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review</a>&nbsp;concluded that Trump missed an opportunity to come out strong, and that he led himself down some "blind alleys" such as disputing crowd sizes and defending January 6 rioters.</p>

<p>In summary, many Trump allies are claiming victory, but many conservative commentators <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-allies-claim-victory-debate-criticize-moderators-pro-kamala-activists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disagree</a>.&nbsp;Some of the left said Harris won,&nbsp;but that it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/harris-trump-debate-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might not matter much</a>.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign is already calling for <a href="/news/2024-09-11-0526/2024-presidential-election-kamala-harris-campaign-calls-second-debate">another debate</a>.</p>
