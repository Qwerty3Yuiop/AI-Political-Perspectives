Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Donald Trump called on his supporters to protest and “TAKE OUR NATION BACK” in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110044039949982181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Truth Social</a> this past weekend, in which he predicted the Manhattan District Attorney would move forward with charges against him this week.</p>

<p><strong>What are the Potential Charges?</strong> The potential charges Trump faces involve allegations that he paid hush money to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, in 2016 to keep her silent about their alleged affair in 2006. Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, testified that he paid Daniels $130,000 days before the 2016 presidential election at Trump's request. Trump denies that&nbsp;and says the affair never occurred, but he did reimburse Cohen the $130,000 while in the White House. Paying hush money is not a crime, but analysis from NBC News suggests the Manhattan DA could target alleged “phony invoices” Cohen submitted throughout 2017 as evidence of fraud.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Significance: </strong>A former U.S. president has never faced criminal prosecution. No charges have been announced, but outlets are reporting <a href="/news/2023-03-17-1532/donald-trump-law-enforcement-agencies-are-prepping-possible-trump-indictment">preparations by federal agencies</a>&nbsp;for a potential indictment.</p>

<p><strong>How Does This Impact 2024 Race? </strong>Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1637051525670264834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted in a tweet</a> that if Trump is arrested, he would be “re-elected in a landslide victory.” A&nbsp;Washington Examiner article pushed back on this prediction, stating, “other than the anger-induced fantasies of Trump’s supporters, nothing suggests this could legitimately happen. Anyone claiming such a thing needs a dose of reality.”</p>

The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has confirmed nothing, but it led to many reactions, including some that said if Trump were indeed arrested, it would lead to a surge in public support and a landslide victory in 2024.
