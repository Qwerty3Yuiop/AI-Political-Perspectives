Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Hunter Biden finished a closed-door testimony on Thursday as part of Republicans' impeachment inquiry into his father, President Joe Biden.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>According to a transcript of the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24451159-hunter-biden-transcript_redacted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testimony</a>, Hunter acknowledged his father's presence on some business calls and meetings, but maintained that Joe didn't profit from or actively participate in them. Hunter acknowledged that a former business partner was indeed referring to Joe Biden when he suggested giving a 10% stake in Chinese company CEFC China Energy Co.&nbsp;"to the big guy," but Hunter said he immediately shut down the idea. Hunter also "admitted that he was high or drunk" when he texted a Chinese business associate in 2017 saying, "I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled."</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>The Biden family's business dealings are at the center of the impeachment probe. Hunter's businesses received more than $5 million in payments from his Chinese associates in the days following that&nbsp;text.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Right-rated sources often highlighted specific revelations from the testimony, especially Hunter's acknowledgment of&nbsp;messages involving "the big guy." Left-rated outlets often highlighted how&nbsp;Hunter and his attorneys criticized&nbsp;Republicans. <a href="/news-source/abc-news-media-bias">ABC News (Lean Left bias)</a> said the testimony "appeared to include no major bombshells."</p>

<p><strong>Why the Difference?&nbsp;</strong>Many Democrats see the impeachment inquiry and scrutiny of Hunter as highly politicized. Many on the right see Democrats as unwilling to acknowledge potential evidence of&nbsp;illegal activity by&nbsp;the Bidens.</p>
