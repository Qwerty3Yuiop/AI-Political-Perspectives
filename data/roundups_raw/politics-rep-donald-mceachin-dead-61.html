<p><b>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</b>"We are all devastated at the passing of our boss and friend, Congressman Donald McEachin," <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMcEachin/status/1597430067260698624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> his&nbsp;chief of staff in a statement. "Valiantly, for years now, we have watched him fight and triumph over the secondary effects of his colorectal cancer from 2013. Tonight, he lost that battle."&nbsp;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&nbsp;called McEachin a "tireless champion for Virginia families and a force for economic opportunity and environmental justice."</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>McEachin was first elected to the House in 2016 and went on to win reelection three times, including earlier this month. He sat on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Natural Resources and the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. His death creates a vacant seat in the House, which won't be filled until a special election is held.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>McEachin's death was a top story from news sources across the political spectrum. Right-rated sources tended to focus more on how the news will affect the Congress's new makeup.</p>
