Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Over 112 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more were injured&nbsp;in a stampede after Israeli forces opened fire near a crowd trying to access&nbsp;aid trucks. Israeli and Palestinian accounts differed and changed throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reported Details: </strong>Eyewitnesses, speaking to <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Lean Left bias),</a> said Israeli forces began shooting after crowds gathered around a convoy of 18 food trucks in western Gaza City early Thursday morning. The aid trucks tried to escape, causing more deaths and injuries. CNN cited a local journalist who said, “Most of the people that were killed were rammed by the aid trucks during the chaos and while trying to escape the Israeli gunfire.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>IDF Narrative: </strong>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said Israeli tanks fired warning shots after a mob of thousands “ambushed”&nbsp;the convoy and “began violently pushing and trampling other Gazans to death, looting the humanitarian supplies.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Palestinian Narratives: </strong>The Hamas-associated health ministry accused the IDF of opening fire on the crowd. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas labeled the incident an “ugly massacre conducted by the Israeli occupation army on people who waited for aid trucks.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>News articles reviewed by AllSides generally covered both narratives but sometimes emphasized one side’s story. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias">Al Jazeera (Lean Left bias)</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;which has covered Palestinians favorably during the war —&nbsp;highlighted quotes attributing the “heinous massacre” to Israel in&nbsp;live coverage of the incident;&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right bias)</a>, which has generally favored Israel, emphasized the IDF’s narrative.&nbsp;<a href="/blog/how-allsides-news-team-uses-ai"><em>This summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.</em></a></p>
