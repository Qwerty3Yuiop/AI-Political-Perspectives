Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>On Wednesday, TV&nbsp;journalist Dylan&nbsp;Lyons was killed and photojournalist Jess Walden was critically injured while they were covering an earlier shooting incident in Orange County, Florida.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>Nineteen-year-old Keith Melvin Moses has been <a href="https://twitter.com/OrangeCoSheriff/status/1628577832426258439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested</a> in connection to the&nbsp;fatal shooting of a woman earlier in the day, and will likely soon be charged over the later shootings of the TV&nbsp;crew, a mother, and her 9-year-old daughter, who later died.&nbsp;The journalists, who worked&nbsp;for Spectrum News 13, were shot in or around their vehicle. Both the White House and the National Association of Broadcasters offered their condolences to the families and colleagues of&nbsp;those affected by the shootings.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong>:&nbsp;“No one in our community – not a mother, not a 9-year-old, (and) certainly not news professionals – should become the victim of gun violence in our community,” Orange County Sheriff John Mina said. Spectrum News 13’s parent company, Charter Communications, released a statement stating, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and the other lives senselessly taken today. Our thoughts are with our employee’s family, friends and co-workers during this very difficult time. We remain hopeful that our other colleague who was injured makes a full recovery. This is a terrible tragedy for the Orlando community.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it</strong>: The shootings were covered by sources across&nbsp;the political spectrum, with all noting that the motive for the shootings&nbsp;is unknown as of Thursday morning.</p>
