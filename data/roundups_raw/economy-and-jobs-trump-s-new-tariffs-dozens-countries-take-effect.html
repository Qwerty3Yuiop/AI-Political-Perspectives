Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Donald Trump's new tariffs on more than 90 countries around the world took effect Thursday, with the goal of reshaping the global trading system and encouraging jobs and manufacturing to return to America.</p>

<p><strong>The Details</strong>: The overall average US tariff rate is at its highest in almost a century, affecting products such as vehicles and steel. The tariffs target countries with close trade ties to China and are expected to bring a degree of stability after months of chaos. However, some have also accused Trump's trade policies of throwing the global economy into turmoil.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>:&nbsp;"Reciprical tariffs take effect at midnight tonight," Trump said on Truth Social. "Billions of dollars, largely from countries thatr have taken advantage of the United States for many years, laughing all the way, will start flowing in to the USA. The only thing that can stop America's greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail!"</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>:&nbsp;Trump sees the global trading system as treating the U.S. unfairly. One of Trump's main pledges as he returned to the presidency was to cut the trade deficit and correct what he sees as a global trading system that treats the US unfairly.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias">BBC (Center bias)</a>&nbsp;emphasized Trump's goal of reshaping the global trading system and reducing the U.S. trade deficit through these tariffs. However, it also pointed to the possibility of turmoil in the global economy as a result of these policies. <a href="/news-source/washington-times-bias">The&nbsp;Washington Times (Lean Right)</a>&nbsp;focused on the potential economic fallout from the tariffs and pointed to signs of self-inflicted damage to the U.S. economy. <a href="/news-source/usa-today-media-bias">USA Today (Lean Left)</a>&nbsp;highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs and pointed to the potential for massive disruptions to global supply chains, higher inflation, and stiff retaliation from trading partners.</p>
