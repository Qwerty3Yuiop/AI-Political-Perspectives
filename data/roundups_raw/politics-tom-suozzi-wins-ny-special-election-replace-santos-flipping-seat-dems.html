Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Democrat Tom Suozzi won the race for New York's 3rd Congressional District in a special election, flipping a seat and cutting into House Republicans’ thin majority.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> On Dec. 1, 2023, <a href="/story/politics-george-santos-expelled-historic-bipartisan-vote">The House of Representatives voted 311-114 to expel Rep. George Santos</a> (R-NY) after an <a href="/story/politics-santos-will-not-seek-reelection-after-release-house-ethics-report">ethics report</a> said he had lied to voters, stolen from his campaign, and broken federal law. Tuesday’s special election was held to fill Santos’ seat in Congress.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> Suozzi previously represented New York’s 3rd Congressional District from 2017 to 2023. With Suozzi’s win, the Republicans’ majority in the House is cut to two seats. Three other vacancies in the House will be filled in the coming weeks through special elections, including the former seat of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), <a href="/story/politics-kevin-mccarthy-retiring-house-end-december">who retired from Congress in December</a>. Of the three vacancies, a report from the <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner">Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)</a> expected two would be filled by Republicans and one by a Democrat, slightly expanding the Republican majority in the House.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong><a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> and <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek (Center bias)</a> highlighted the role that the immigration debate played in the election. The New York Times reported that Suozzi “distanced himself from his party” regarding immigration and vowed to “work with Republicans to fix a broken immigration system.” Newsweek echoed this and added that Suozzi criticized President Biden over his age and did not commit to voting for him in 2024.</p>
