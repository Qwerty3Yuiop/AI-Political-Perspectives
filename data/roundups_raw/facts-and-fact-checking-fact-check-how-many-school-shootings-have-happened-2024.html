Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Sources that track the "number of U.S. school shootings" often use different criteria and&nbsp;definitions of "school shootings,"&nbsp;leading to public confusion about the issues of gun safety, school safety, and violent crime.</p>

<p><strong>Different Data:&nbsp;</strong>There are two commonly cited sources tracking U.S. "school shootings." <a href="https://k12ssdb.org/all-shootings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The K-12 Violence Project</a>, run by data scientist <a href="https://x.com/david_riedman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Riedman</a>, has a "K-12 School Shooting Database" counting&nbsp;any incident "when a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time, or day of the week."&nbsp;This tracker counted 330 school shootings in 2024. <a href="/news-source/education-week">EducationWeek (Center bias)</a>, a news organization, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2024/01#:~:text=debates%2C%20and%20solutions.-,Methodology,-Counting%20Incidents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uses more limited criteria</a>&nbsp;and counted 39 school shootings in 2024. The K-12 Violence Project&nbsp;<a href="/story/fact-checking-how-many-school-shootings-have-happened-2023">counted 346 school shootings in 2023, versus 37 counted</a> by EducationWeek.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covers It:&nbsp;</strong>Many sources, especially on the left and center but also some on the right, cite the K-12 Violence Project data when reporting on the "number of school shootings" in a given timeframe. <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner">The Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)</a> is among the sources that <a href="/news/2023-04-04-0622/facts-and-fact-checking-democrats-distort-record-guns-after-nashville-shooting">use</a>&nbsp;the EducationWeek data.</p>

<p><strong>Why the Difference:&nbsp;</strong>People on the left are generally in favor of gun restrictions and may gravitate toward data sources that emphasize problems with guns. People on the right are generally less supportive of gun restrictions and may gravitate toward data sources that make gun problems seem less severe.&nbsp;<em>This summary was updated throughout 2024.
