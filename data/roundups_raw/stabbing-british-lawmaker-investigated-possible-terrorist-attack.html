Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>British counterterrorism officers are reportedly leading the investigation into the Friday morning&nbsp;stabbing of David Amess, a Conservative Party member of the U.K. Parliament. Amess was stabbed to death at a meeting with constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, east of London. Police arrested a 25-year-old man at the scene and later released a statement saying they were “not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident and do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the wider public.” Police also said they had not yet determined whether the incident was a terrorist attack, saying, “It will be for investigators to determine whether or not this is a terrorist incident.”</p>

<p>Coverage was&nbsp;widespread and prominently featured across the spectrum on Friday, with most outlets describing Amess as a “Conservative” politician or lawmaker. With notable exceptions like Fox News and The New York Times, most outlets connected the Conservative Party to British Prime Minister <a href="/story/reporters-lodge-complaint-over-access-biden-johnson-meeting">Boris Johnson</a>.&nbsp;</p>
