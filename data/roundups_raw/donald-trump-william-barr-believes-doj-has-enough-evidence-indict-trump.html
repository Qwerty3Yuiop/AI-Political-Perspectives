Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>In an interview on PBS Friday, former Attorney General William Barr, once a Trump ally, spoke candidly about Trump’s time in office and stated he believed the Department of Justice had enough evidence to indict Trump on charges related to the documents <a href="/story/trump-says-fbi-raided-mar-lago-home">seized by FBI agents at Mar-a-Lago</a> in August.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> On the DOJ Investigation, Barr stated, “if the Department of Justice can show that these were indeed very sensitive documents, which I think they probably were, and also show that the president consciously was involved in misleading the department, deceiving the government, and playing games after he had received the subpoena for the documents, those are serious charges.” Speaking on <a href="/story/donald-trump-trump-announces-2024-presidential-campaign">Trump’s 2024 run</a>, Barr stated, “he’s had his chance. He obviously doesn’t have the qualities necessary to unite the party, which is the first step on the road back, and he should stand aside.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>The interview aired the same day Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="/story/justice-garland-names-jack-smith-special-counsel-investigation-trump-mar-lago-docs">appointed a special counsel</a> in the Department of Justice’s investigation into Trump. FBI agents executed a warrant search on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in August, during which they seized around 11,000 documents, roughly 100 of which were marked as containing classified materials.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Barr’s statements were covered moderately across the spectrum. The quotes contained in this roundup were the quotes most cited in outlets. HuffPost included a note attributed to ‘critics’ that said Barr took too long to speak out against Trump.</p>
