Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A group of truckers who support&nbsp;former President Donald Trump&nbsp;may refuse to deliver&nbsp;to New York City after&nbsp;he was <a href="/story/donald-trump-judge-orders-trump-pay-355-million-ny-civil-fraud-case">fined $355 million&nbsp;and&nbsp;banned from doing business</a> in the city&nbsp;for three years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>A man known on X as <a href="https://twitter.com/chicago1ray?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Ray</a> originally posted about the boycott on Friday to his 240,000 followers, and said he and other truckers would stop delivering to the city. He later deleted the video and <a href="https://twitter.com/Chicago1Ray/status/1759578055679344804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;the decision&nbsp;was "based on what I see as being misinterpreted by some to cast me as a leader of something that I have no wish to be, nor will.".</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</strong>"I’ve been on the radio talking to drivers for about the past hour and I’ve talked to about 10 drivers," said Ray in the <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidYeshua4/status/1759229153453183178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original&nbsp;video</a>.&nbsp;He added that truckers will "stop refusing loads starting on Monday."</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>It's unclear if the boycott will materialize or impact business.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Sources across the spectrum covered Ray's video. Many mentioned other condemnations of the fraud ruling, including from&nbsp;Elena Cardone,&nbsp;wife of&nbsp;real estate investor Grant Cardone, who started&nbsp;a GoFundMe page called "Stand with Trump; Fund the $355M Unjust Judgment."&nbsp;</p>
