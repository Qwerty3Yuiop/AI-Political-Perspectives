Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>An armed California man was arrested early Wednesday morning near Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Maryland home, several reports&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Supreme Court spokesperson said the man was apprehended around 1:50 a.m. after telling police officers he intended to kill Kavanaugh; police reportedly visited the neighborhood after receiving an anonymous tip about the man. Sources cited by <a href="/news-source/washington-post-media-bias">The Washington Post (Lean Left bias)</a>, which first reported the story,&nbsp;said the man was angry about <a href="/story/did-police-respond-appropriately-uvalde-shooting">recent mass shootings</a> and the <a href="/story/supreme-court-overturn-roe-v-wade-draft-opinion-leak-casey">leaked draft Supreme Court opinion</a> that would overturn&nbsp;Roe v. Wade. While it was unclear on Wednesday afternoon what type of gun the man had, sources told <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> the man also had a knife.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Wednesday afternoon, although right-rated outlets featured the story much more prominently on homepages than left-rated outlets. Coverage across the spectrum tied the news to <a href="/news/2022-05-20-0908/extremists-threaten-murder-supreme-court-justices-dhs-says-brace-violence">recent DHS warnings</a> of potential threats against Supreme Court justices. Right-rated outlets often framed the incident as an attack and tied it to recent <a href="/story/roe-v-wade-protests-move-homes-supreme-court-justices">protests outside of some justices’ homes</a>; <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right bias)</a> featured the story with the homepage tagline, “ENEMY AT THE GATES.”&nbsp;<em>Update 6/8/22 1:50 p.m.: Previous version implied "officials" said the man was from California; while sources had told this to several outlets, officials had not yet confirmed this publicly.&nbsp;</em></p>
