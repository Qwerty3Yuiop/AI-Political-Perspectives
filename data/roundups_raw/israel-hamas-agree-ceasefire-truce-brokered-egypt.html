Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Israel and Hamas&nbsp;have reportedly agreed to a ceasefire after&nbsp;trading attacks and airstrikes along the Gaza Strip for over a week. The truce is expected to take effect by Friday morning.&nbsp;“The Political Security Cabinet unanimously accepted the recommendation of all security officials, the chief of staff, the head of the Shin Bet [internal security agency], the head of the Mossad [foreign intelligence] and the head of the National Security Council, to accept the Egyptian initiative for a bilateral unconditional ceasefire," the&nbsp;Israeli security cabinet said in a&nbsp;statement, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-middle-east-57183127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a report by&nbsp;the BBC</a>. A&nbsp;Hamas official reportedly told the Associated Press, "“The Palestinian resistance will commit itself to this deal as long as the occupation is committed."&nbsp;President Joe Biden on Thursday hailed the ceasefire, commending Netanyahu for "[bringing] the current hostilities to a close in less than 11 days” and commending&nbsp;the Egyptian government for its key role in the truce. Biden also promised to marshal international resources to rebuild Gaza, saying&nbsp;“we will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian authority — not Hamas, the authority — in a manner that does not permit Hamas to restock its arsenal."</p><p>Coverage from across the political spectrum tended to focus on the details of the ceasefire and reactions from various officials and groups.</p></div> <h2 class="mb-2 leading-6 text-lg text-gray-500 font-medium mt-4 p-0">
