Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Widespread protests have occurred across the United States in response to the killing of Tyre Nichols.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Friday night, Memphis police <a href="/story/violence-america-released-footage-shows-memphis-police-beating-tyre-nichols">released body camera footage</a> from the beating of Tyre Nichols. The footage sparked widespread protests across the country on Friday and Saturday, most of which have remained peaceful.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The protests were particularly large in Atlanta, where just last weekend protests over a new police training facility turned violent. Atlanta had prepared 1,000 National Guard units to be mobilized, however, protests remained peaceful. Protesting has happened in many other American cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Memphis, Boston, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Columbus, and Portland. <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1619427921441038336?s=20&amp;t=VREO8TeG7UUHYbNKKC387A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three were arrested</a> in NYC, and in LA a police cruiser was <a href="https://twitter.com/FOXLA/status/1619225250280898560?s=20&amp;t=VREO8TeG7UUHYbNKKC387A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attacked with a firework</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> “We want peaceful protests, that is what the family wants,” said Nichols’ stepfather, Rodney Wells. Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens said, “I am encouraged by the swift action taken by Memphis leaders to seek accountability from those responsible,” he added that the Atlanta Police Department “has taken great strides in recent years to fully implement vital policing reforms.” President Biden said, “Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Coverage across the political spectrum has been similar tonally, with emphasis from most outlets on the peacefulness of the protests, as well as the swift charging of the involved officers. Prior to the release of the footage, AllSides <a href="/blog/media-bias-alert-coverage-riots-police-violence-shows-emotionalism-and-sensationalism">noted some emotionalism and sensationalism bias</a> in photos and coverage.</p>
