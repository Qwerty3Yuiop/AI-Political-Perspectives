Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Right-rated voices are accusing the <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Lean Left bias)</a> of intentionally omitting a suspected murderer's immigration status.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was killed last week while running on campus. On Friday, police arrested Jose Antonio Ibarra in connection with the murder. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed later that Ibarra entered the U.S. illegally. In AP's article published Saturday, Ibarra’s immigration status was not mentioned. This sparked criticism from the right. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ press secretary Christina Pushaw&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1761802129872675237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>,&nbsp;“The corporate media will blame a woman for exercising alone before blaming an illegal alien for killing her.”</p>

<p><strong>The AP Story: </strong><a href="/news/2024-02-26-1459/media-bias-killing-nursing-student-out-run-highlights-fears-solo-female">The AP article</a> was framed around the potential dangers women face while jogging alone, stating that “Crime statistics indicate that these types of attacks are rare, but they underscore the hypervigilance women must take when going out, even for a run on campus.” The article cited similar incidents in recent years and quoted other women runners’ reactions to Riley’s murder. This was not the only coverage of the incident published by the AP. On Saturday, the outlet <a href="https://apnews.com/article/woman-dead-university-georgia-augusta-nursing-student-1e41b14c2d1e7c4889bc509abf5b42df" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article reporting Ibarra’s arrest</a>.&nbsp;This article, published before ICE confirmed Ibarra’s immigration status, said Ibarra’s immigration status was not yet known.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Right-rated outlets are covering the backlash, often only including quotes critical of the AP.</p>

<p><strong>Why the Difference?:&nbsp;</strong>Right-rated news sources are more likely to focus on crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants because they&nbsp;highlight&nbsp;the potential dangers of illegal immigration, an issue of greater importance to the political right.</p>
