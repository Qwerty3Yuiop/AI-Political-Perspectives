</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Some Democrats are divided over whether President Joe Biden should run for president again in 2024.<br />
	<br />
	The New York&nbsp;Times published interviews this week with dozens of Democrats, many of whom were "alarmed about Republicans’ rising strength and extraordinarily pessimistic about an immediate path forward" for their party. The Times explained how many top Democrats interviewed for the story wished to remain anonymous, but that their key concerns about Biden running again were his age and the "repeated failures of his administration to pass big-ticket legislation on signature Democratic issues."&nbsp;At 79, Biden is the oldest sitting U.S. president ever, and would be 86 at the end of a second term.<br />
	<br />
	Biden's&nbsp;approval rating also continues to trend downward. Multiple polls, including <a href="/news-source/fivethirtyeight-0">FiveThirtyEight (Center)</a>, have his public approval at the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest point of his presidency</a>.<br />
	<br />
	News sources across the political spectrum have highlighted the conversation about Biden's possible 2024 campaign. Coverage from right-rated sources tends to focus on Biden's low approval ratings and frame Biden as old and incompetent. Many on the right focused on Democrats who are concerned that Biden unfit to run again and framed Democrats as being in disarray over the issue. Several voices from left-rated outlets, such as <a href="/news-source/atlantic">The Atlantic (Lean Left bias)</a> and <a href="/news-source/daily-beast-media-bias">Daily Beast (Left bias)</a>, also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/06/biden-run-for-reelection-2024/661297/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/democrats-need-a-trump-of-their-own-to-win-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opinions </a>this week about why Biden shouldn't run in 2024, often highlighting his age and arguing that Democrats need a more forceful presence.</p>
