Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Many publications have dropped the nationally syndicated comic Dilbert&nbsp;after its creator Scott Adams described 47% of polled Black Americans as a “hate group."</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> In an episode of his podcast earlier this week, Scott Adams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/K6TnAn7qV1s?feature=share&amp;t=800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed a recent Rasmussen Poll</a> that found only 53% of Black Americans think “it’s OK to be white." Adams said he’s “going to back off from being helpful to Black America, because it doesn’t seem like it pays off.”&nbsp;Adams offered advice that “white people (should) get the hell away from black people.”&nbsp;As a result of Adams’ comments, many notable publications including <a href="/news-source/washington-post-media-bias">Washington Post (Lean Left)</a>, <a href="/news-source/los-angeles-times-bias">LA Times (Lean Left)</a>, and <a href="/news-source/usa-today-media-bias">USA Today (Lean Left)</a> have dropped the long-running comic.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Dilbert has been running since 1989 and is known for its satirization of corporate and white-collar America. Adams, who <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/1287001922637926401?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has not shied away from racial discussion in the past</a>, said the only outcome of his lifelong efforts to help Black Americans has been receiving the label “racist.”&nbsp;The same Poll <a href="https://twitter.com/Rasmussen_Poll/status/1628458725513080832?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> that 79% of Americans think black people can be racist too, while 12% disagree.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Outlets across the spectrum reported Adams’ comments and ensuing cancelations of Dilbert similarly. The Epoch Times reported more in-depth on Adams’ comments since the uproar began, while most other publications offered briefer synopses.</p>
