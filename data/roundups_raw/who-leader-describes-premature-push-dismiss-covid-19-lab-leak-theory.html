Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/health/20210716-push-to-rule-out-covid-19-lab-leak-theory-was-premature-who-chief-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Thursday at a press conference</a> that there was a “premature push” to dismiss&nbsp;the COVID-19 lab leak theory without sufficient evidence. Tedros also called on China to be more transparent as health officials search for evidence of the pandemic's origins.&nbsp;The theory that the pandemic began with a labaratory leak in Wuhan, China&nbsp;was ruled out early in the pandemic as a debunked conspiracy by many Democratic leaders, public health officials and mainstream media outlets; former President Donald Trump and others on the right maintained that the scenario was possible. <a href="/blog/interest-covid-19-lab-leak-theory-grows">The theory has gained mainstream traction in recent months</a> as scientists and officials have revisited evidence supporting the hypothesis, and as no "smoking gun" evidence for the pandemic's genesis has emerged.<br />
	<br />
	Many right-rated outlets highlighted Tedros' comments prominently on Friday, often while framing both China and the mainstream media in a negative light; many also focused on Tedros' remarks that “it’s common" for lab accidents to happen. His statements were also covered by several center-rated sources, including the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-world-news-health-science-coronavirus-pandemic-c0c594f9060f676c0ea48c2d1c69daec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-chief-says-premature-dismiss-virus-lab-leak-theory-2021-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>.&nbsp;As of Friday morning, no left-rated outlets published original reporting on Tedros' comments; some, including Washington Post (Lean Left) and Los Angeles Times (Lean Left), republished the AP's story.</p>
