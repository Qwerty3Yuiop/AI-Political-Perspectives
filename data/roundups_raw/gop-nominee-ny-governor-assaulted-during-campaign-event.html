Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican nominee in New York's 2022 gubernatorial race, was <strong>assaulted&nbsp;at a campaign event</strong> Thursday.<br />
	<br />
	Zeldin was on stage at the event in&nbsp;Perinton, New York, when a <strong>man armed with a pointed weapon</strong> approached him and grabbed his arm. The two <a href="https://twitter.com/NickReisman/status/1550292941461151746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">struggled for a moment</a> between several others moved to subdue the attacker, who fell to the ground along with Zeldin. The suspect was charged with attempted second degree assault, and was released from custody several hours later, according to Monroe County's&nbsp;Sheriff’s Department.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Zeldin <a href="https://twitter.com/leezeldin/status/1550352498078130176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>&nbsp;later<strong>&nbsp;that the suspect "will likely be instantly released under NY’s laws."</strong> His 2022 opponent, incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul (D), <a href="https://twitter.com/KathyHochul/status/1550295647865257984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">condemned</a> "this violent behavior in the strongest terms possible" and said she was "relieved to hear that Congressman Zeldin was not injured and that the suspect is in custody." Zeldin is running on a tough-on-crime platform, and he and Hochul have traded criticisms <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40leezeldin%20hochul&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over New York's purportedly lenient criminal justice laws</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40leezeldin%20hochul&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeldin's support for former President Donald Trump</a>.<br />
	<br />
	The attack made headlines across the spectrum. Most highlighted&nbsp;the fact that the attacker was armed and Hochul's comments. <strong>Reports from right-rated outlets</strong> focused more on the attacker's weapon&nbsp;and how he was released hours after his arrest, which many said Zeldin predicted with his tweet.&nbsp;<strong>Coverage from left- and center-rated sources</strong> tended to mention Zeldin's support for&nbsp;Trump's unsubstantiated&nbsp;claims of decisive voter fraud in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>
