Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The pace of U.S. inflation <strong>slowed in July for the first time in months</strong>.<br />
	<br />
	The <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI) held steady between June and July</strong>, and rose 8.5% from a year earlier, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Labor</a>. In June, <a href="/story/inflation-rises-40-year-hight-91">inflation rose 1.3% from May</a>&nbsp;and 9.1% over the previous year, which set a new 40-year record. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv expected annual inflation to rise&nbsp;8.7% headline and monthly inflation to climb 0.2% in July.<br />
	<br />
	Energy prices overall fell 4.6% from June as <a href="/story/why-are-gas-prices-falling-and-will-trend-continue">gas prices dropped</a>, but <strong>energy costs remained 33% higher</strong> than they were a year ago. Food prices rose 1.1% from June to July, and are up 11% from a year prior.&nbsp;The "food at home" index rose 13.1%&nbsp;over the last 12 months, the largest annual increase since March 1979.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Sources across the spectrum, especially those on the left and center but also on the right, <strong>covered the data similarly </strong>and&nbsp;highlighted how inflation rose less than expected between June and July. CNN Business said months of high inflation "pose a growing challenge for the Federal Reserve." Fox Business said Wednesday's report is "a welcoming sign for the Federal Reserve as it seeks to cool price gains and tame consumer demand."</p>
