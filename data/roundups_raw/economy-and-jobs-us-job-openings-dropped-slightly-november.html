Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>U.S. employers posted about 62,000 fewer job openings in November than in October, leading total openings to hit their lowest level since March 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Job openings totaled 8.79 million in November, lower than October’s 8.85 million but still higher than January 2020’s pre-pandemic 7.1 million; <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSJOL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job openings</a> reached elevated levels after spiking from December 2020 to July 2021. Changes varied by sector; transportation, warehousing, and utilities lost 128,000 openings, while construction gained 43,000. Federal government job openings fell by 58,000, while state and local governments gained 24,000.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Fewer job openings could signal that <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-federal-reserve-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-hints-future-cuts">the Federal Reserve’s anti-inflation interest rate hikes</a> succeeded in cooling the economy. <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-will-us-economy-see-soft-landing-or-recession-2024">However, some fear a slowdown could trigger a deeper recession in 2024.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage reflected the usual trend of polarized economic outlooks; some right-rated outlets took a pessimistic view, highlighting the “fresh 2-year low,” while some left-rated outlets noted that openings were “high by historic standards.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why the Difference: </strong>People are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-analysis-americans-rate-economy-partisan-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">famously</a> partisan when evaluating the economy, and with the 2024 election 10 months away, partisans are struggling to control the economic narrative. An image of a strong economy could help President Joe Biden and Democrats, but one of a struggling economy could help his opponents.</p>
