Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>More than 100 people are dead and over 160 remain missing after catastrophic floods devastated Kerr County, Texas this week.&nbsp;<a href="/story/federal-state-and-tribal-powers-was-national-weather-service-prepared-texas-floods">Questions remain</a> about how prepared the region was for the floods and whether the losses could have been prevented.</p>

<p><strong>Camp Mystic’s Disaster Plan: </strong>Inspectors approved emergency and evacuation plans for Camp Mystic – the Christian summer camp from which there have been over two dozen fatalities – two days before the flood. Additionally, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch with about a day’s notice, but no evacuation took place in time. The camp's <a href="https://www.campmystic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website states</a>, "We have been in communication with local and state authorities who are tirelessly deploying extensive resources to search for our missing girls."</p>

<p><strong>NOAA and NWS Cuts: </strong>The Trump administration enacted cuts to both the <a href="/story/media-bias-left-and-right-media-split-federal-government-s-preparedness-hurricane-season">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) and the <a href="/story/federal-state-and-tribal-powers-was-national-weather-service-prepared-texas-floods">National Weather Service</a> (NWS). The NWS – backed by the White House – claimed its flood watch allowed Texas residents enough time to evacuate, even though some chose not to. A former NOAA director made similar claims. He <a href="https://balancedweather.substack.com/p/balancedwx-special-tragic-flash-flooding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Substack</a>, “...there is little evidence that any of the recent cuts to NOAA/NWS negatively impacted services for this event...”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> <a href="/story/federal-state-and-tribal-powers-was-national-weather-service-prepared-texas-floods">Media outlets remain split</a> on whether government cuts significantly impacted damages and fatalities. <a href="/news-source/usa-today-media-bias">USA Today (Lean Left bias)</a> highlighted vacancies at weather service offices, but included both accusations and defenses for the effects of government cuts. <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek (Center)</a> used similar framing and pointed to forecasting inadequacies as an alternative scapegoat. <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right)</a> emphasized the amount of infrastructure funding that went into containing – and failed to contain – the Guadalupe River during the last hundred years.</p>
