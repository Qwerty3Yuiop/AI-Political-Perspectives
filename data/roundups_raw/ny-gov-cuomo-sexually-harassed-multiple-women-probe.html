Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>An <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.08.03_nyag_-_investigative_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investigation</a> by the New York state Attorney General's office&nbsp;says that Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D)&nbsp;sexually harassed at least 11 women, including staffers and state employees,&nbsp;and fostered a “toxic culture”&nbsp;in his office. The probe began in March after <a href="/story/ny-gov-cuomo-accused-sexual-harrassment-less-coverage-left-rated-outlets">several women accused Cuomo of sexual harassment</a>. The report does not mention any&nbsp;specific penalties for Cuomo. The governor has previously denied allegations of misconduct; <a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1OyKAEVYLVoKb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in virtual remarks released Tuesday</a>, Cuomo said he "never touched anyone inappropriately" and pledged not to resign. New York lawmakers have <a href="https://eoinhiggins.substack.com/p/we-have-to-impeach-ny-state-lawmakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly already prepared articles of impeachment</a> against Cuomo.</p>

<p>The news was the top story on most major news websites across the spectrum Tuesday afternoon. Many news sources, regardless of bias rating, highlighted the probe's finding&nbsp;that Cuomo also retaliated against at least one woman over her accusations; many also mentioned the separate probe Cuomo faces over his office's alleged cover-up of COVID-19-related deaths in nursing homes. Some coverage from right-rated sources focused on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/in-march-joe-biden-said-andrew-cuomo-must-resign-if-an-investigation-confirmed-sexual-assault-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments President Joe Biden made in March</a> saying&nbsp;that Cuomo should resign if a probe confirmed the harassment allegations.</p>
