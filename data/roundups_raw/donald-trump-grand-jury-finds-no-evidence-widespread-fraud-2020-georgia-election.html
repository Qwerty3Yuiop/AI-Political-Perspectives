Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A portion of a Georgia grand jury report into allegations that former President Donald Trump and his allies attempted to subvert and overturn the results of the 2020 election was released Thursday. The report concluded that claims of widespread voter fraud in the Georgia election were false and recommended certain witnesses be indicted for perjury.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>The report stated that the jury unanimously decided that “no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election.” The report also states that “a majority of the Grand Jury believes that perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it,” recommending indictments “where the evidence is compelling.” Trump’s campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News that “the long awaited important sections of the Georgia report, which do not even mention President Trump’s name, have nothing to do with the President because President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.”</p>

<p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>Newsweek’s report cited analysis from legal experts to determine that the “release of the report signifies that indictments are imminent.” The article quoted Nick Akerman, former assistant special Watergate prosecutor, predicting Trump would be indicted.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> The report is being covered most prominently in left- and center-rated outlets. Fox New's coverage first quoted the Trump team's response to the report and made no mention of the report's finding about widespread fraud not taking place, instead determining that Trump's lawyers were "unable to support those allegations."</p>
