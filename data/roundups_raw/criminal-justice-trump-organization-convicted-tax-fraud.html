Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A&nbsp;Manhattan jury found the Trump Organization guilty on all 17 charges against it in a criminal tax fraud scheme on Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>The 17 counts include conspiracy, scheme to defraud, criminal tax fraud, and falsifying records.&nbsp;The Trump Organization could face up to&nbsp;$1.6&nbsp;million in fines when sentenced in mid-January. Former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg and the company were <a href="/story/perspectives-charges-against-trump-organization">indicted last year</a>, and Weisselberg <a href="/story/former-trump-organization-cfo-pleads-guilty-tax-fraud">pleaded guilty</a> this August. Prosecutors alleged that the Trump Organization cheated on its taxes to provide executives with luxury benefits.&nbsp;Former President Donald Trump and his family were not charged with any crimes.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</strong>"For 13 years the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities," Manhattan's district attorney said Tuesday. "It was my own personal greed that led to this,"&nbsp;Weisselberg said during his testimony.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>The verdict was a top story from sources across the political spectrum Tuesday afternoon. Sources on all sides described the crimes and highlighted how Trump himself was not charged. CNN noted that Trump was still "mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors about his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives."</p>
