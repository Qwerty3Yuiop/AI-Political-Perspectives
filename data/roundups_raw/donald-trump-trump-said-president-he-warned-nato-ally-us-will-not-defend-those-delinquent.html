Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Donald Trump recounted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGP1hJJNstI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a conversation he had with a NATO leader while President on Saturday</a>, in which he said the U.S. would not protect a NATO ally delinquent on dues.</p>

<p><strong>Direct Quote: </strong>“I did the same thing with NATO. I got them to pay up. NATO was busted until I came along. I said, ‘Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay are you going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’… You never saw more money pour in….” Trump added, “One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, ‘Well sir, if we don’t pay, and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?’ I said… ‘No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.’”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Trump’s comments came amidst gripes over the disparity between European and U.S. aid to Ukraine, and how Ukraine can sever ties with NATO for a closer relationship with Russia at any time.</p>

<p><strong>White House Response:</strong> White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, “Encouraging invasions of our closest allies by murderous regimes is appalling and unhinged – and it endangers American national security, global stability, and our economy at home.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Most media across the spectrum framed headlines around Trump’s “whatever the hell they want” comment, but made it clear it was relative to delinquent payments. Some outlets, like <a href="/news-source/forbes">Forbes (Center bias)</a> and <a href="/news-source/atlantic">The Atlantic (Left bias)</a> published <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/02/10/donald-trump-said-he-would-encourage-russians-to-do-whatever-they-want-that-includes-killing-little-girls-in-ukraine/?sh=29ccc7e540a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sensational headlines</a> pegged on the news, but were actually for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/trump-rally-nato/677426/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opinion commentary</a>.</p>
