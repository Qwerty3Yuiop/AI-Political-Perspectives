Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/101821zor_4f14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled</a> that&nbsp;police officers in two cases were entitled to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified immunity</a>, a key issue for <a href="/news/2021-06-09-0944/police-reforms-potential-qualified-immunity-compromise-may-not-be-enough-get">police reform</a> advocates. No dissent was filed in either case. In both cases, the Court argued that lower courts had improperly applied past cases as precedent for&nbsp;defining&nbsp;the&nbsp;officers’ actions as having violated "clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” The first case involved an officer kneeling on the plaintiff’s back for eight seconds; the other involved multiple officers lethally shooting a man after he grabbed a hammer and raised it at them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coverage was somewhat more common in left- and center-rated outlets than right-rated outlets on Monday. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with some outlets focusing only on the case itself and others including the political context surrounding qualified immunity.&nbsp;</p>
