Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><span>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to “fix” the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a program that provides compensation to people adversely affected by vaccines.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong><span> Kennedy argued that the VICP process “has devolved into a morass of inefficiency, favoritism, and outright corruption.” Kennedy has not yet released his plan to reform VICP but has said he wants to increase the statute of limitations and provide compensation for people harmed by COVID-19 vaccines via VICP, according to </span><a href="/news-source/politico-media-bias"><span>Politico (Lean left bias)</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong><span> The VICP was established in the 1980s as a way for patients who experienced vaccine side effects to receive compensation from pharmaceutical companies without requiring these manufacturers to be negligent.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias"><span>CNN (Lean Left)</span></a><span> focused on Kennedy’s past criticisms of the VICP and his connections with the vaccine-skeptical Children’s Health Defense, and highlighted concerns that he might further an anti-vaccine agenda and potentially promote unfounded theories about vaccines. </span><a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias"><span>The Hill (Center)</span></a><span> acknowledged and provided support for Kennedy’s claim that the program needs modernization; it also suggested the changes might undermine the program entirely and reduce access to childhood vaccines. The report noted Kennedy’s ability to add new injuries, like autism, to the list of compensable injuries. </span><a href="/news-source/newsmax"><span>Newsmax (Right)</span></a><span> framed the decision as “a vital step in rebuilding public trust in the vaccine program.” The article quoted Kennedy describing the VICP system as “a quagmire for parents and children” and argued that VICP currently provides no incentive to companies to make vaccines safer “because they can’t be sued thanks to the 1986 White House and Congress.” </span></p>
