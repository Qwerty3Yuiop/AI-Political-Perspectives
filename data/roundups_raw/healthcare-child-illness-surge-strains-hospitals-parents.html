Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Hospitals and parents are being strained by an&nbsp;outbreak of the child illness known as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in addition to seasonal flu cases and continued COVID-19 infections.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong>: Parents are happily sending kids back to school while "discounting influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, all the other pieces that fit to this respiratory illness puzzle,"&nbsp;said Jackie Follansbee, a school nurse in&nbsp;Washington state.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data suggest that infants 6 months and younger are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/dashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being hospitalized with RSV</a> roughly&nbsp;seven times more than they were pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, RSV has been one of the most common viruses found in children, but this year's outbreak has alarmed some&nbsp;doctors enough for them to call on the Biden Administration to declare a national health emergency. That declaration&nbsp;would provide more federal resources to combat the RSV surge, similar to those provided during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered it</strong>: Right-rated sources focused more on how the Biden Administration hasn't declared&nbsp;a national emergency. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus more on the challenges facing hospitals, parents, and sick children. Reports across the spectrum highlighted experts who suggested that COVID-19 lockdowns made children more susceptible to infections.</p>
