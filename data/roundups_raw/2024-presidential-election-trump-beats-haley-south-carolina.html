<p><strong>The Details:</strong> News outlets across the spectrum called the race immediately after polls closed at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. As of early Sunday, with 99% of the vote in, Trump had earned roughly 60%.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Trump has <a href="/story/2024-presidential-election-trump-wins-nevada-gop-caucus">won every Republican primary</a> in the 2024 election cycle so far. Haley, who formerly governed South Carolina, is Trump’s only remaining notable challenger in the race but <a href="/news/2024-02-25-0338/2024-presidential-election-polls-say-nikki-haley-can-t-win-her-home-state-here">was not expected to win the state</a>. Despite polls currently showing no electoral path to victory for Haley, she has <a href="/news/2024-02-25-0336/2024-presidential-election-nikki-haley-dropping-out-election-after-south">maintained that she will not be suspending her campaign</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> During his victory speech, Trump said, "I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now."&nbsp;Haley said in a speech Saturday night, "I said earlier this week, that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run for president. I'm a woman of my word."&nbsp;Of her vote share, she said, "Forty percent is not some tiny group. There are huge numbers of voters in our Republican primaries who are saying they want an alternative."</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Media across the spectrum highlighted the ease of Trump’s victory. <a href="/news-source/reuters">Reuters (Center bias)</a> noted that Trump did not mention Haley by name in his victory speech.</p>
