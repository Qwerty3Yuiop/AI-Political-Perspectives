</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><strong>U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks dismissed </strong>former President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and several others on Friday, calling it a “political manifesto.”</p>

<p><strong>Trump’s lawsuit <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/24/donald-trump-sues-hillary-clinton-and-allies-russia-00020174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alleged</a> that Clinton and her allies “orchestrated a malicious conspiracy”</strong> to “weave a false narrative” of <a href="/story/mueller-report-finds-no-trump-russian-collusion">collusion</a> between the Trump campaign and Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.610157/gov.uscourts.flsd.610157.267.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decision</a>, Middlebrooks — who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton — said Trump was “not attempting to seek redress for any legal harm,” but&nbsp;instead was&nbsp;“<strong>seeking to flaunt a two-hundred-page political manifesto</strong> outlining his grievances against those that have opposed him.” The judge appeared to sharply criticize Trump’s arguments, writing, “It is not simply that I find the Amended Complaint ‘inadequate in any respect’; it is <strong>inadequate in nearly every respect.”</strong> Not only had Trump’s lawsuit exceeded the statute of limitations, Middlebrooks wrote,&nbsp;the statements addressed by Trump’s complaint&nbsp;were “plainly protected by the First Amendment.” <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek (Center bias)</a> noted that Middlebrooks appeared to threaten Trump’s lawyers with legal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/judge-threatens-sanctions-trump-lawyers-over-clinton-lawsuit-1741544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sanctions</a> for potentially presenting a case without supporting evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Coverage was widespread across the spectrum</strong> on Friday but was often drowned out by coverage of Queen Elizabeth's death. Some coverage across the spectrum used sensational words like “stomps,” <a href="https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/09/09/judge-trashes-trumps-rico-lawsuit-against-clinton-perkins-coie/?slreturn=20220809150145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“trashes,”</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/judge-throws-out-trump-lawsuit-clinton-russiagate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“scathing.”</a></p>
