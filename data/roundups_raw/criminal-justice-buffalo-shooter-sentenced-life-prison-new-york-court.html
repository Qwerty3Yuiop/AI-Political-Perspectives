Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Payton Gendron was sentenced to life in prison by a New York court on Wednesday for the murder of 10 people in Buffalo, New York. Gendron pled guilty to hate crime and domestic terror charges in November.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Last May, Gendron murdered 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. Prior to and following the massacre, Gendron expressed that his actions were driven by racism and white supremacy. All 10 of the people killed were black. Gendron still faces federal hate crime charges that could result in a death penalty sentence, which is not allowed in New York courts.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>Before the verdict was read, Gendron apologized in the courtroom, stating, “I cannot express how much I regret all the decisions I made leading up to my actions on May 14th.” Following the verdict, Gendron’s attorney stated, “we hope that knowing he will never be free again will offer some small bit of comfort to those he has hurt so much.” Erie County District Attorney John Flynn dismissed Gendron’s apologies, stating, “I anticipate what he said today was to save his life in federal court.”</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>Outlets across the spectrum noted an incident in the courtroom where a <a href="/news/2023-02-15-0913/criminal-justice-buffalo-shooting-hearing-descends-chaos-man-rushes-gunman">man was restrained after attempting to get to Gendron</a>. Reuters characterized the U.S. as “a country that has grown accustomed to such crimes and where racial tensions continue to simmer.”</p>
