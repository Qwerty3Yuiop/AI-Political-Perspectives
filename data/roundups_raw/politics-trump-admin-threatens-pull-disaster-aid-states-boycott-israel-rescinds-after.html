Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Trump administration announced on Friday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would deny federal disaster aid to states that boycotted Israeli firms, though it has now <a href="https://x.com/esaagar/status/1952484733163843877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescinded</a> the conditions.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> FEMA said states must follow “terms and conditions” that require they wouldn’t cut “commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies” to qualify for funding. The terms applied to at least $1.9 billion allotted for rescue equipment, emergency salaries, and backup power systems, among other things, according to documents reviewed by <a href="/news-source/reuters">Reuters (Center bias)</a>, which first reported the news on Monday. Later on Monday, however, <a href="/news-source/just-news-media-bias">Just The News (Lean Right)</a> reported the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/2025_0418_fy2025_dhs_terms_and_conditions_version_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated the notices</a> to no longer include the conditions.</p>

<p><strong>DHS Update:</strong> The DHS <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1952482455954341930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on Monday evening, “There is NO FEMA requirement tied to Israel in any current NOFO. No states have lost funding, and no new conditions have been imposed. FEMA grants remain governed by existing law and policy and not political litmus tests. DHS will enforce all anti-discrimination laws and policies, including as it relates to the BDS movement, which is expressly grounded in antisemitism. Those who engage in racial discrimination should not receive a single dollar of federal funding.” <a href="/news-source/saagar-enjeti-media-bias">Saagar Enjeti (Center) </a><a href="https://x.com/esaagar/status/1952495486557999286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>, “Ok after speaking w/ folks here's whats going on: An original guidance from DHS explicitly stated that federal disaster funding was barred from states that allowed boycott of Israel. The WH changed this explicit language after widespread outcry BUT the DHS tweet makes it clear the admin reserves the right to deny these funds on BDS grounds based on the Anti-Boycott Act.”</p>

<p><strong>Criticisms: </strong>When the news first broke on Monday, several commentators across the spectrum condemned the initial policy change. <a href="https://x.com/cenkuygur/status/1952438816548983047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Walsh (Right)</a> <a href="https://x.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1952460069985202388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, “There is just no way to reasonably claim that this qualifies as ‘America First.’” <a href="/news-source/cenk-uygur-media-bias">Cenk Uygur (Left)</a> <a href="https://x.com/cenkuygur/status/1952438816548983047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, “It’s absolutely humiliating for America to be controlled by a foreign country like this.” <a href="/news-source/glenn-greenwald-media-bias">Glenn Greenwald (Center)</a> <a href="https://x.com/ggreenwald/status/1952392947548192985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, “The Trump Admin -- yet again -- prioritizes the foreign country they revere over the interests of American citizens.”</p>
