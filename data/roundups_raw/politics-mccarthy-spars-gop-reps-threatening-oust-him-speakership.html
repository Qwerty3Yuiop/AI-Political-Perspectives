Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) challenged far-right Freedom Caucus members to attempt to oust him from the speakership Thursday morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Details: </strong>In a closed-door House Republican meeting Thursday morning, McCarty addressed continued threats from the right flank of the house to remove him from the speakership. Per the agreement McCarthy made when he <a href="/blog/new-congress-kicks-messy-house-speaker-vote">won the speakership in January</a>, a single representative can trigger a vote to remove McCarthy. Freedom Caucus members frequently remind McCarthy of the leverage they hold over him. On Thursday morning, McCarthy called their bluff, stating, “If you want to file a motion to vacate, then file the f**king motion,” according to Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), a McCarthy ally.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Congress has until the end of the month to pass roughly a dozen spending bills. If these bills are not passed, the federal government will shut down at the start of October. This week, McCarthy has worked to pass a Department of Defense appropriations bill, but far-right holdouts have halted the process. Earlier this week, McCarthy announced an <a href="/story/politics-biden-impeachment-political-theater-or-legitimate-misconduct-probe">impeachment probe into President Joe Biden</a>, a move seen by many left-rated voices as a concession to far-right holdouts. Despite this action by McCarthy, Freedom Caucus members continue to oppose spending bills without further spending cuts.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> McCarthy’s reported profanity grabbed headlines across the spectrum Thursday morning. Left- and center-rated headlines framed his words as addressed to all House Republicans, while right-rated outlets were more specific about who his words were intended for.</p>
