Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Benny Gantz, leader of Israel’s National Unity party, resigned from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s emergency war cabinet on Sunday, saying Netanyahu “prevents us from progressing to real victory.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Gantz had previously said he would leave the war government on June 8 unless Netanyahu adopted a new plan for the war, including plans for post-war Gaza. Netanyahu refused, saying Gantz should have issued an ultimatum to Hamas instead. Gantz had planned a press conference for Saturday night, but delayed it after Israel successfully rescued four hostages in an operation that reportedly resulted in 274 Palestinian deaths. Gantz had previously served as the chief of staff for the Israeli Defense Forces; his decision to leave is seen as a significant shift in Israel’s political landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> Saying he and his allies joined the war cabinet “because we knew it was a bad government,” Gantz said that recently, “fateful strategic decisions are met with hesitation and procrastination due to [narrow] political considerations,” per a translation by <a href="/news-source/times-israel">The Times of Israel (Center bias)</a>. Netanyahu wrote on X, “Benny, this is not the time to abandon the campaign — this is the time to join forces.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage was common across the spectrum on Sunday and Monday, generally aligning on describing Gantz and the impact of his departure. However, Breitbart (Right bias) stood out by highlighting speculation of collaboration between Gantz and the Biden administration, which has also pushed Netanyahu to adopt a plan for post-war Gaza.&nbsp;<a href="/blog/how-allsides-news-team-uses-ai"><em>This summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.</em></a></p>
