Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Los Angeles’s newly elected mayor Karen Bass announced she would declare a state of emergency in the city to tackle the homelessness crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>CBS News quoted Bass stating, “I will not accept a homelessness crisis that afflicts more than 40,000 individuals and affects every one of us.” Newsweek quoted her stating, “My emergency declaration will recognize the severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently move people inside, and do so for good.” Fox News quoted her stating, “no matter what, we never give up. We have never given up and that’s our LA magic.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Declaring a state of emergency allows the city to more easily access funds and clear bureaucratic hurdles. Bass pledged to find housing for 17,000 of Los Angeles’s homeless population during her term as Mayor. The homelessness crisis in the city was a central issue in this year's mayoral campaign, where Bass (D) defeated billionaire real-estate developer Rick Caruso, a former Republican who ran as a Democrat.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media is Covering It: </strong>Fox News, CBS News, and the <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Lean Left Bias)</a> all <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-los-angeles-kamala-harris-homelessness-state-government-b2cab2d64a0a33ae58141ec3a407db05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> the number of homeless people in Los Angeles as 40,000, in line with the Mayor’s statements. In <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/12/los-angeles-mayor-homelessness-community-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> from <a href="/news-source/daily-caller">The Daily Caller (Right Bias)</a> and Newsweek, the homeless population figure accounted for the entirety of Los Angeles County, some of which is outside Mayor Bass’s jurisdiction. These outlets <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/12/los-angeles-mayor-homelessness-community-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listed the figure</a> around 70,000, citing a report from the <a href="https://www.lahsa.org/news?article=895-lahsa-releases-2022-great-los-angeles-homeless-count-results-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority</a>.&nbsp;<em>Updated 12/14/22 at 9:44 a.m. to correct Rick Caruso being misidentified as a Republican.</em></p>
