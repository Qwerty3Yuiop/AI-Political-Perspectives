</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Should books about LGBTQ+ issues with sexually explicit details be available in K-12 school libraries?</p>

<p>At issue are recent novels such as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35489159-lawn-boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Lawn Boy,"</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35442720-jack-of-hearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Jack of Hearts (and Other Parts),"</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44280883-all-boys-aren-t-blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"All Boys Aren't Blue"</a>&nbsp;and other books that&nbsp;detail LGBTQ+ youth coming-of-age stories through sometimes sexually explicit passages. In Texas, Governor&nbsp;Greg Abbott directed state officials to review all books in schools to prevent children from viewing "pornography or other inappropriate content." Texas state Rep. Matt Krause (R) identified&nbsp;850 books about race or sexuality, and ordered Texas school districts to investigate whether the books were in their libraries.&nbsp;The efforts to investigate and potentially ban some literature have prompted concerns about <a href="/blog/perspectives-cancel-culture">cancel culture</a> and sex education from some schools, parents and students. Some are worried about government censorship and discrimination against marginalized youths — others support the investigations and are concerned that their children may be exposed to explicit content without parental oversight.</p>

<p>Reports from left- and center-rated sources often framed the efforts to ban certain books as politicized, unjust censorship that would hurt the social development of LGBTQ+ students, and described the recently growing popularity of LGBTQ+ books in schools as a movement to diversify the reading content available in public schools. Few focused on parents who are concerned about sexualized content. Conversely, reports from right-rated sources tended to highlight parents who expressed concern about sexualized content being available to young students in school libraries, and how that material&nbsp;could negatively impact their social development and morals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
