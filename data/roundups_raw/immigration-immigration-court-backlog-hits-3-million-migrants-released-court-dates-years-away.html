Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The U.S. immigration court system now has a backlog of over 3 million cases, as <a href="/story/immigration-cbp-encountered-14509-migrants-one-day-breaking-record">migrants continue to arrive in record numbers</a> and authorities struggle to keep up with the influx.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:&nbsp;</strong>Data from the <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/734/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TracImmigration</a>&nbsp;project at Syracuse University&nbsp;shows the backlog of cases has surpassed&nbsp;3 million, with each judge in the system being assigned roughly 4,500 cases.&nbsp;When unauthorized immigrants are processed, they receive&nbsp;a court date to appear for the next step in their case before being released. Amid the backlog, many of those dates are several years away.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>The backlog was around&nbsp;2 million at this time last year and hit 1 million for the first time in Sept. 2019. On average,&nbsp;between 50,000 and 100,000 cases were added to the backlog each&nbsp;quarter from 2016 to 2021. Nearly 400,000 cases were added in the third quarter of 2023, and the Q4 total is expected to be near 450,000.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it:&nbsp;</strong>Center- and right-rated sources blamed a lack of resources, including border agents and judges, for the backlog overflow.&nbsp;As of this writing, no left-rated outlets have mentioned the record-high court backlog.</p>

<p><strong>Why the Difference?&nbsp;</strong>Media&nbsp;on the right and in the center are generally more concerned about illegal immigration than media on the left are, and they're quicker to highlight how the system has become more strained under the Biden administration.</p>
