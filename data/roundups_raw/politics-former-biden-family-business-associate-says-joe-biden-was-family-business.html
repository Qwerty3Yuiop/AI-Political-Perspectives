Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former Biden family business associate Tony Bobulinski <a href="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/bobulinski_opening-statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testified to the&nbsp;House Oversight Committee</a> about Joe Biden's involvement in his family's business affairs&nbsp;in a closed-door hearing on Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>key Quotes:&nbsp;</strong>"The Biden family business was Joe Biden, period," Bobulinski said. "Joe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family’s business; he was an enabler, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability."</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>Bobulinski, a U.S. Navy veteran,&nbsp;founded&nbsp;the investment firm Sinohawk Holdings with Hunter and James Biden in 2017. They then moved to enact a joint venture with private banking company CEFC China Energy. Bobulisnki and another former family business associate, Rob Walker, say Joe Biden attended several meetings regarding the CEFC deal, including one&nbsp;in 2017 with CEFC's chairman.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Left-rated media often painted Bobulinski and his statements as uncredible. Some highlighted his connections to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and lawsuits Bobulinski has been involved in. Center- and right-rated media were generally less critical of Bobulinski and focused more on the specifics of his claims. Many described him as a Navy&nbsp;veteran, which left-rated sources were less likely to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why the Difference: </strong>Especially in an election year, liberals and Democrats&nbsp;are more likely to question the motivations of a source who criticizes their leader, while others might be less skeptical.</p>
