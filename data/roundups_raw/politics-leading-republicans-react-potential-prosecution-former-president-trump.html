Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Leading Republicans are reacting&nbsp;to news from former President Donald Trump that he is facing potential prosecution by the Manhattan District&nbsp;Attorney's office, and that he expects to be <a href="/news/2023-03-20-0230/politics-former-pres-trump-says-hell-be-arrested-tomorrow-new-york-based-hush">arrested on Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Reactions:&nbsp;</strong>Former Vice President Mike Pence said prosecution of Trump is "not what the American people want to see," and that the case is a <a href="/news/2023-03-19-0627/politics-mike-pence-defends-trump-says-manhattan-da-case-against-former-boss">political prosecution</a>. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he wants no violence or protests if Trump is arrested or indicted. McCarthy has also asked Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH) and the House Judiciary Committee to <a href="/news/2023-03-20-0742/politics-house-gop-panel-respond-manhattan-da-s-plan-indict-trump">investigate</a> whether federal funds were used to conduct this investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>: “It just feels like a politically charged prosecution here. And I, for my part, I just feel like it’s just not what the American people want to see,”&nbsp;Pence told ABC News.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: Prosecutors in New York have been&nbsp;looking into whether Trump made hush money payments to adult film star&nbsp;Stormy Daniels, and violated campaign finance laws. A year ago, Daniels <a href="/news/2022-03-22-0835/porn-star-stormy-daniels-loses-appeal-trump-case-owes-former-president-almost">lost her case to appeal</a> a lower court decision in her unsuccessful defamation lawsuit against Trump.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It</strong>: Sources across the&nbsp;spectrum covered Trump's&nbsp;potential arrest and prosecution.&nbsp;Some right-rated sources focused on Republicans who criticized the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Some left-rated sources&nbsp;noted Pence's <a href="/news/2023-03-12-1519/politics-former-vp-mike-pence-accuses-reckless-donald-trump-endangering-his">recent remarks criticizing</a> Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot.</p>
