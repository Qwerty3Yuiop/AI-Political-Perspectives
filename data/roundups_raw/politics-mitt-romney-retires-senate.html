Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) announced he would not seek reelection in 2024 on Wednesday, calling for “a new generation of leaders” ahead of the release of his new biography.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> “Frankly, it’s time for a new generation of leaders. They’re the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in,” the former GOP presidential nominee said in a <a href="https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-releases-message-to-utahns-on-senate-reelection-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. On the 2024 race for the White House, Romney added, “We face critical challenges—mounting national debt, climate change, and the ambitious authoritarians of Russia and China. Neither President Biden nor former President Trump are leading their party to confront them.”</p>

<p><strong>Biography Revelations:</strong> In Romney’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/11/mitt-romney-retiring-senate-trump-mcconnell/675306/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biography</a>, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is quoted calling former President Donald Trump “an idiot” who “doesn't think when he says things.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reactions from the Left: </strong>Voices on the left generally spoke positively about Romney and negatively about the GOP he will leave behind. The Editorial Board of the <a href="/news-source/salt-lake-tribune-media-bias">Salt Lake Tribune (Lean Left bias)</a> said Romney’s votes to impeach Trump were “the picture of a Profile in Courage.” A guest op-ed in&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/msnbc">MSNBC (Left bias)</a> said his legacy was “well-earned,” but “his brand of Republicanism has now failed.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reactions from the Right: </strong>Voices on the right were mixed. A <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner">Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)</a> writer said Romney retired “with dignity,” unlike “the rest of our gerontocracy.” One <a href="/news-source/national-review">National Review (Right bias)</a> writer called him “the right man at the wrong time,” but others said his legacy was “flawed” or that he was “no profile in courage.”&nbsp;</p>
