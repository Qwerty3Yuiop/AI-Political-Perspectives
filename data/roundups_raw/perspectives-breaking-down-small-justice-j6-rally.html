Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A demonstration in front of the U.S. Capitol Saturday was small and mostly uneventful, following concerns from some about potential violence and unrest from supporters of former President Donald Trump. Reports across the spectrum highlighted how the 100-150 "Justice for J6" attendees were far&nbsp;outnumbered by law enforcement, journalists and counterprotesters. Demonstrators were there in support of people arrested for the Jan. 6&nbsp;Capitol riot; organizers argue that some of those charged in connection to the Capitol riot were nonviolent and were exercising their right to protest. Capitol Police reportedly made two arrests for&nbsp;illegal possession of weapons; they were joined in monitoring the rally&nbsp;by other regional police departments and&nbsp;the National Guard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Concerns about violence were more common from left- and center-rated outlets leading up the rally; after the fact, coverage of the rally's uneventfulness has been more prominent in right-rated outlets.&nbsp;Right-rated voices often accused left-rated media outlets and commentators of greatly exaggerating <a href="/news/2021-09-17-0732/january-6-vs-september-18-how-law-enforcement-hopes-prevent-another-riot">concerns about the rally</a> leading up to Saturday and questioned the lack of coverage from left-rated sources about the rally's uneventfulness. Some left-rated voices framed the rally's&nbsp;small size as a bad sign for pro-Trump Republicans; others on the left said despite the low turnout, the rally was dangerous and aimed to "free many of the insurrectionists of responsibility and cast them as victims."</p>
