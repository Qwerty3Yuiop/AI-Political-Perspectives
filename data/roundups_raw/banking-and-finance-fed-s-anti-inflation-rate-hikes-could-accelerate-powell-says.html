Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Federal Reserve will likely end up <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-fed-raises-interest-rates-fight-inflation-one-week-midterms">raising interest rates</a> to a higher peak than previously expected, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday — <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-fed-s-preferred-inflation-gauge-increases">continuing the fight against inflation</a> at <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-will-there-be-recession-2023#">the risk of triggering a recession.</a></p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> “The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell said in <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20230307a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepared remarks</a> ahead of dual House and Senate hearings, adding that “we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes” if the data warranted it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bipartisan Unemployment Concerns:</strong>&nbsp;Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and John Kennedy (R-LA) both pressed Powell on&nbsp;unemployment risks. Kennedy suggested Powell was “trying to put people out of work,” and Warren said Powell was planning to put “2 million hard-working people” out of work over the next year. Powell pushed back, arguing that high inflation <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-why-are-eggs-so-expensive-now">would also hurt working families.</a></p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to fight persistent inflation by raising the cost of borrowing, which was expected to cool economic activity and quell the <a href="/story/price-gouging-high-gas-prices">forces incentivizing price increases</a>. However, economic activity has remained stronger than the Fed expected, and <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-unemployment-hits-lowest-rate-1969-economy-adds-517k-jobs-january">unemployment is at a record low.</a> The Fed’s goal is to “promote maximum employment” while bringing inflation back down to the standard 2% annual rate; <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-inflation-rose-64-january">in January, that number was 6.4%.</a></p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage was widespread, particularly in business outlets,&nbsp;most of which are rated Lean Left or Center. Reports across the spectrum were generally more likely to highlight Warren’s “heated” comments than Kennedy’s.</p>
