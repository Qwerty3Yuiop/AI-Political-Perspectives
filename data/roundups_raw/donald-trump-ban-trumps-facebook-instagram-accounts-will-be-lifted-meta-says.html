Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, both of which were suspended following the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, will be reinstated in the coming weeks, according to parent-company Meta.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/trump-facebook-instagram-account-suspension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg called the decision to suspend Trump “an extraordinary decision taken in extraordinary circumstances.” In deciding whether to lift the ban, Clegg said Meta determined that the “risk has sufficiently receded” and the ban should be lifted. Should Trump choose to return to Meta’s social media platforms, he will face “heightened penalties for repeat offenses,” said Clegg. Following the announcement, Trump stated in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109752172651767013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Truth Social</a> that “such a thing should never again happen to a sitting President, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Trump was also suspended from Twitter following the Capitol riot. That <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account</a> was <a href="/story/donald-trump-elon-musk-lifts-twitters-permanent-ban-donald-trump">reinstated in November</a>, shortly after Twitter was <a href="/story/business-musk-becomes-twitters-sole-director-after-dissolving-board">acquired by Elon Musk</a>, but Trump has yet to return to the platform, so far instead opting to continue using his <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truth Social account</a>. In November, Trump announced he was <a href="/story/donald-trump-trump-announces-2024-presidential-campaign">running for the presidency</a> in 2024.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> The announcement was covered across the spectrum. Fox News called January 6 a “riot” and said Meta’s decision to ban Trump was met with&nbsp; “backlash across the political spectrum” without citing any specific backlash from left- or center-rated sources. AP and CNBC called January 6 an “insurrection.”</p>
