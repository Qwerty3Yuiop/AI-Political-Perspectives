Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Hip-hop star Sean 'Diddy' Combs has been found guilty of two of the five charges he faced in his criminal trial and could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Combs was found guilty on two different counts of transportation to engage in prostitution and could face up to 10 years on each charge. He was acquitted of two sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion charges and one racketeering conspiracy charge.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Combs was <a href="/story/criminal-justice-diddy-arrested-charged-racketeering-and-sex-trafficking">arrested and charged</a> in mid-September in Manhattan. The verdict comes after six weeks of testimony involving 34 witnesses from prosecutors and none from the defense. The jury, consisting of eight men and four women, convened for just over two days before reaching their conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> In coverage immediately after the news broke, outlets penned headlines differently in terms of whether they highlighted that Combs was found guilty of two charges or not guilty of three. <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> and some others prominently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/diddy-jury-reaches-verdict-all-counts-sex-trafficking-racketeering-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> that he was found not guilty of racketeering and that the charges he was convicted of are less serious. <a href="/news-source/daily-mail">The Daily Mail (Right)</a> wrote the amount of prison time Combs could face in its headline.</p>
