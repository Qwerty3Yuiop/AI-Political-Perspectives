Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The US Navy sank three Houthi boats that aimed to hijack a Maersk cargo ship in the Red Sea on Sunday, killing their crews.</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>Four Houthi ships opened fire on the Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhao around 6:30 AM and came within 65 feet of boarding the ship, according to US Central Command (CENTCOM). Officials said the strike was in self-defense and that the fourth boat fled. CENTCOM said it was the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-says-it-shot-down-2-missiles-launched-houthi-controlled-areas-2023-12-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second Houthi attack</a> on the vessel to be thwarted in 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> The incident is the latest altercation with the <a href="/story/middle-east-navy-responds-more-houthi-missile-attacks-red-sea-us-says-fully-enabled-iran">Iran-backed</a> Yemeni Houthis, who have <a href="/news/2023-10-31-2227/middle-east-iran-backed-houthis-declare-war-israel-after-reported-killing-saudi">declared war</a> on Israel and <a href="/story/world-are-houthi-attacks-red-sea-threat-global-trade">disrupted trade</a> in the Red Sea <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GHZ-9m0oc8I9UxbmOe5PMHMLrWBgKdPUAnAzKeLnwRE/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">since November</a>. The group, which the U.S. does not recognize as Yemen’s official government, was designated as a terrorist organization by former President Donald Trump during his final days in office and removed from the list by President Biden in early 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, "We don't seek a conflict wider in the region and we're not looking for a conflict with the Houthis. The best outcome here would be for the Houthis to stop these attacks as we have made clear over and over again." A <a href="https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1741259817602429357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> from CENTCOM said, “This is the 23rd illegal attack by the Houthis on international shipping since Nov. 19.”</p>
