Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he would again seek the presidency in 2024.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</strong>"There's never been anything like it, this great movement of ours," Trump said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne5fyl-M-y4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an hour-long speech</a>&nbsp;at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. "America's comeback starts right now." He continued by saying that "the decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical left lunatics running our government right into the ground. This decline is not a fate we must accept."</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>The announcement comes amid a disappointing midterm election cycle&nbsp;for Republicans and a <a href="/story/2022-elections-republicans-turn-trump-amid-feud-desantis">power struggle</a> within the party. If successful, Trump would&nbsp;become just the second U.S. president ever&nbsp;elected to&nbsp;two nonconsecutive terms. The former president is currently the subject of separate Justice Department probes into his <a href="/story/trump-legal-team-says-mar-lago-probe-has-spiraled-out-control">handling</a> of classified materials at Mar-a-Lago, and his <a href="/story/trump-investigation-justice-department-jan-6-criminal-probe">efforts</a> to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Left- and center-rated news sources often highlighted the ongoing criminal investigations of Trump, his false 2020 election claims, and the fact that he's the only president ever to be impeached twice. Right-rated outlets tended to focus more on quotes from&nbsp;Trump's speech, especially times when he criticized Biden.</p>
