Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) suggested on Wednesday that the Biden administration destroyed key files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Burchett’s Comments:</strong> The comments came after a <a href="/story/criminal-justice-doj-and-fbi-conclude-no-evidence-epstein-murdered-ran-blackmail">memo from the Justice Department concluded</a> Epstein had no “client list” for blackmailing purposes, <a href="/story/politics-maga-remains-skeptical-epstein-conclusions-some-across-spectrum-agree">contrary to widespread speculation</a>. Burchett, who had earlier predicted that the public would never know the truth about Epstein, said he believes the Biden administration strategically destroyed once-existing files. He further asserted, “I think if they’d ever had anything on [President Donald] Trump, it would have been out Day 1 under the Biden administration.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> Some Epstein files were released to influencers in February, but little of judicial use was found. Following this, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the FBI to further investigate the situation. After months of anticipation, the Justice Department stated that the list did not exist and no more Epstein files would be released to the public.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It:</strong> Coverage of Burchett’s comments was widespread – despite a lack of evidence to support them – but more prominent from media on the right. Media across the political spectrum tended to sensationally frame the comments as claims rather than opinions or suggestions. <a href="/news-source/washington-examiner">Washington Examiner (Lean Right bias)</a> focused on direct quotes from Burchett, as well as those from conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly, who offered an alternative theory. <a href="/news-source/newsnation-media-bias">NewsNation (Center)</a>&nbsp;– the outlet to which Burchett made his comments – included quotes without delving into surrounding context or theories. <a href="/news-source/independent-media-bias">The Independent (Lean Left)</a> referred to the comments as a “wild conspiracy theory,” noting the lack of evidence, and it criticized conservatives for not further investigating potential involvement from Trump.&nbsp;</p>
