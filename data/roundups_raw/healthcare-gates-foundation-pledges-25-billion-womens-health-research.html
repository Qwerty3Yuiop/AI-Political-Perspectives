Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Gates Foundation has committed $2.5 billion over the next five years to spend on research for women's health issues, such as menopause and preeclampsia.</p>

<p><strong>The Details</strong>:&nbsp;The investment will focus on obstetric care and maternal immunization, maternal health and nutrition, gynecological and menstrual health, contraceptive innovation, and sexually transmitted infections. The initiative's stated aim is to kickstart research, develop products, and ensure equitable access to them worldwide. The Foundation’s head of gender equality, Dr. Anita Zaidi, acknowledged that the $2.5 billion was a “drop in the bucket” compared with what is needed and called on others to step in, including the private sector, philanthropists, and governments.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong>: “Women’s health continues to be ignored, underfunded and sidelined. Too many women still die from preventable causes or live in poor health,” founder Bill Gates said in a <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2025/08/womens-health-funding-commitment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. “That must change.” Dr. Rasa Izadnegahdar, director of the maternal, newborn, child nutrition and health sector of the Gates Foundation, said, “With some sadness, I say it’s the largest sort of cumulative investment in women’s health R&amp;D, but the overall investment in this area needs to be substantially greater.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>:&nbsp;According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1551714422000441?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study</a>, despite women making up 51 percent of the world’s population, they only made up 40 percent of the participants in clinical trials for issues that primarily impacted women.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It</strong>: The story was not widely covered and AllSides did not find coverage from the&nbsp;right.&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/axios">Axios (Lean Left bias)</a>&nbsp;highlighted specific Boston-area institutions receiving funding, while&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/hill-media-bias">The Hill (Center)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/reuters">Reuters (Center)</a>&nbsp;focused more on the overall necessity of the commitment for women's health with particular emphasis on the historical neglect of women's health issues. Outlets from the left and center ostensibly reached a consensus that the pledged amount is significant, but ultimately not enough to fully address the gap in women's health research and care. Some outlets, like <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Lean Left)</a> republished Reuters' coverage.</p>
