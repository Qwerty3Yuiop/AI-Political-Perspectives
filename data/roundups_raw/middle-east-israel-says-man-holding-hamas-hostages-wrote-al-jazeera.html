Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said three of the hostages rescued over the weekend were being held in the family home of a man who had worked as a journalist for <a href="/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias">Al Jazeera (Lean Left bias).</a></p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>The IDF said it had killed the man, Abdallah Aljamal, but did not say whether it had also harmed his family; the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed throughout Saturday’s operation. Citing Al Jazeera’s website, the IDF <a href="https://x.com/IDF/status/1799851736150204610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a>, “‘Journalist’ Abdallah Aljamal was a Hamas terrorist holding Almog, Andrey and Shlomi hostage in his family’s home in Nuseirat. No press vest can make him innocent of the crimes he has committed. @AlJazeera what’s this terrorist doing on your website?”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> <a href="/story/middle-east-why-netanyahu-banning-al-jazeera">Israel previously banned Al Jazeera from operating within its borders.</a> Al Jazeera reportedly denied employing Aljamal, who is only credited on one article on Al Jazeera’s website: an opinion article titled, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/1/22/tales-of-torture-from-israels-prisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Tales of torture from Israel’s prisons.”</a> Aljamal’s description reads: “Abdallah Aljamal is a Gaza-based reporter and photojournalist. He often reports from the ongoing ‘March of Return’ protests at the fence separating besieged Gaza from Israel.” The Palestine Chronicle (Not Rated) <a href="https://x.com/PalestineChron/status/1799727785700987201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a> that Aljamal was a “Palestine Chronicle contributor from Gaza.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage tended to reflect pre-existing attitudes and skepticism&nbsp;about the IDF, Hamas, and Al Jazeera. For instance, <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> highlighted the IDF’s framing of Aljamal as a “Hamas terrorist,” and <a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Lean Left bias)</a> noted in its headline that the IDF had “alleged” their claim without “providing evidence.”</p>
