Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Florida's seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases has risen steadily in August amid the spread of the Delta variant, and the state currently has the highest seven-day average of new cases in the country. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times (Lean Left bias) data</a>, an average of roughly 16,500 people in Florida are hospitalized with COVID-19 every day, the most of any state; Texas (12,357) is the only other state with an average higher than 10,000. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) opposes coronavirus restrictions including mask and vaccine mandates; he has <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/07/30/governor-desantis-issues-an-executive-order-ensuring-parents-freedom-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called on&nbsp;schools to let parents decide</a> whether children wear masks, and has threatened financial repercussions for schools and administrators who defy the edict.<br />
	<br />
	The state's COVID-19 situation has been covered more by center- and left-rated outlets than&nbsp;by right-rated outlets. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources has often focused on the high case counts, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/florida-and-texas-open-covid-antibody-treatment-centers-as-delta-surge-overwhelms-hospitals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concerns about over-capacity at hospitals</a>, debates over mask mandates in schools, and DeSantis' management of the situation, with some framing him as a poor leader. Some reports from right-rated outlets highlighted a University of South Florida epidemiology professor who predicted Florida's current spike will peak next week, with the possibility of reaching herd immunity in three weeks if vaccination rates improve.</p>
