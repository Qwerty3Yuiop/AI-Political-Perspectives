Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The House Ways and Means Committee has obtained former President Donald Trump's tax returns, and is set to make them public within days.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:<a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/jctreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;</a></strong><a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/jctreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Initial documents</a> released by House Democrats show how Trump pulled in millions of dollars from investments&nbsp;between 2015 and 2020, while also claiming millions in real estate&nbsp;losses that reduced his tax burden. Trump paid $750 in income tax in 2016&nbsp;and 2017, and $0 in 2020. In addition, Democrats say the IRS failed to maintain its mandatory presidential audit program while Trump was in office, and that they could only find proof of a single IRS audit during his presidency.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:&nbsp;</strong>"This is a major failure of the IRS under the prior administration, and certainly not what we had hoped&nbsp;to find," said Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), chair of the&nbsp;Ways and Means Committee.</p>

<p><strong>For Context:&nbsp;</strong>Neal mounted the legal fight to obtain Trump's tax returns back in 2019, and the Supreme Court <a href="/story/donald-trump-supreme-court-says-trumps-tax-returns-can-be-released-democrats">ruled in Neal's favor</a> last month.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:&nbsp;</strong>Left- and center-rated sources have covered the news more prominently than right-rated sources have. Many on the left frame the details of the returns as evidence of Trump's shady&nbsp;financial practices. Some center- and right-rated outlets focused more on issues with the tax system overall, like&nbsp;questions about the tax code and the IRS's reluctance to audit Trump, and were less likely to frame Trump negatively.</p>
