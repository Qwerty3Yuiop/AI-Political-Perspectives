Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The S&amp;P 500 <a href="/news/2022-06-14-0603/world-shares-wobbly-after-wall-street-sinks-bear-market">entered “bear market” territory</a> on Monday as stock prices fell sharply. What is a bear market, and what does this mean for the economy at large?</p>

<p>Bear markets occur when stock prices fall more than 20% from recent highs, and they often coincide with recessions. The S&amp;P 500 index, which measures 500 of the largest U.S. companies, also <a href="/story/sp-500-falls-bear-market-territory">briefly dipped&nbsp;into bear market territory in May</a>. Analysts generally agree that investors’ fears about&nbsp;inflation — and the interest rate hikes used by the Federal Reserve to fight&nbsp;inflation —&nbsp;are driving current&nbsp;stock trends. On Monday, investors were caught between <a href="/story/inflation-stayed-hot-and-kept-rising-may">Friday’s hot inflation report</a>&nbsp;and an expected <a href="/news/2022-06-13-1943/fed-likely-consider-075-percentage-point-rate-rise-week">0.75% interest rate hike</a> at the Fed’s Wednesday meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monday’s selloff&nbsp;impacted stock exchanges in <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-markets-decline-after-bear-market-hits-wall-street-01655182493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asia</a> and Europe as well. The <a href="/story/senators-introduce-bipartisan-bill-regulate-cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a> market also dove to new lows, leading crypto exchange CoinDesk to lay off <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/14/first-mover-americas-coinbase-layoffs-and-the-bear-market-guide-to-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,100 employees</a>. While a bear market is bad news for stock investors, analysts appeared divided on how much damage it would do to the rest of the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coverage was widespread and generally balanced across the spectrum on Tuesday, particularly in business-focused outlets. “Bear” themes were common in economic reporting, including images of bears and taglines like “Poking the Bear.” While some commentators raised fears of a recession, others stressed that the bear market was only temporary.</p>
