Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> published previously unreleased photos of Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan mansion taken in the years leading up to his 2019 arrest that included surveillance cameras and photos with prominent world leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Photos &amp; Cameras:</strong> Prominent figures featured in photos included former Cuban President Fidel Castro, Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger, former President Bill Clinton, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and current President Donald Trump. Cameras were visible in photos of Epstein’s bedroom and an adjoining room, though The Times noted, “Several of Mr. Epstein’s victims have said the mansion was outfitted with a network of hidden video cameras.” The Times reported seeing photos of the “massage room” that included “paintings of naked women, a large silver ball and chain, and shelves stocked with lubricant.”</p>

<p><strong>Letters: </strong>The Times also published letters from some of Epstein’s guests sent to celebrate his 63rd birthday in 2016. Former Israeli Prime Minister and his wife noted the diversity of Epstein’s guests and wrote, “There is no limit to your curiosity. You are like a closed book to many of them but you know everything about everyone.” Director Woody Allen <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/bcb49431e5162d24/bb7b4989-full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> the first dinners he attended were “meagre” but evolved into being “well served.” He said they were served often “by some professional houseman and just as often by several young women reminding one of Castle Dracula where Lugosi has three young female vampires who service the place.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other Notables: </strong>Photos published by The Times showed a sculpture of a woman in a bridal dress clinging to a rope hanging in the central atrium and a photo of a dollar bill that had “I was wrong!” written on it and was signed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. The Times also reported seeing photos that included a “preserved” map of Israel drawn on a chalkboard with Barak’s signature and a first edition version of the novel Lolita on display.</p>

<p><strong>How The Media Covered It: </strong>The Times shared some of the photos it reported seeing, but for others, only described what it saw. The only letter The Times published in full was the one from Woody Allen. <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">The New York Post (Lean Right)</a> framed its coverage around The Times’ reporting but published additional photos it attributed to the Southern District of New York (SDNY). Included were photos of Epstein’s massage table and a bookshelf. The Post wrote in its caption, “Among Epstein’s possessions was a first edition of Vladimir Nabokov’s novel ‘Lolita,’” though AllSides was unable to determine if there was a copy of Lolita included in the <a href="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/manhattan-federal-ghislaine-maxwell-trial-19016101.jpg?resize=1187,1536&amp;quality=75&amp;strip=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo</a>. The Times wrote prominently in its coverage that Lolita was “showcased” in the mansion.</p>
