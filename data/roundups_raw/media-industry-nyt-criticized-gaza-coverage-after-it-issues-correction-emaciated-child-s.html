Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><a href="/news-source/new-york-times">The New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> is facing criticism for its Gaza coverage after it updated a recent feature to note that an emaciated child depicted in one of the article’s images also suffered from a pre-existing condition.</p>

<p><strong>Print Coverage:</strong> The Times’ <a href="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1440/810/image0-43.jpeg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original July 25 print coverage</a>, titled “Young, Old and Sick Starve to Death in Gaza: ‘There Is Nothing’” included the photo with a caption that said 18-month-old Mohammed Zakaria al-Mutawaq was “born healthy, but recently… diagnosed with severe malnutrition,” according to his mother.</p>

<p><strong>Online Coverage: </strong>The Times also published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an online version</a> on July 24, titled “Gazans Are Dying of Starvation.” The feature was shared widely on various platforms and drew commentary from many, including former President Barack Obama, who said it “underscore[s] the immediate need for action to be taken to prevent the travesty of innocent people dying of preventable starvation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>On July 29, The Times added an editor’s note to its online coverage: “This article has been updated to include information about Mohammed Zakaria al-Mutawaq, a child in Gaza suffering from severe malnutrition. After publication of the article, The Times learned from his doctor that Mohammed also had pre-existing health problems.”</p>

<p><strong>From The Right:</strong> <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right)</a> highlighted many prominent criticisms of The Times and based its reporting on the print feature. <a href="/news-source/the-free-press-media-bias">The Free Press (Lean Right)</a> published an <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/mistakes-at-the-new-york-times-only" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">editorial</a> titled “Mistakes at ‘The New York Times’ Only Go in One Direction” and linked to an <a href="https://archive.md/eZ8Kp#selection-5477.0-5477.217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archived version</a> of the online coverage. The Free Press concluded, “The Times should respect its readers by bringing them news that reflects complicated reality, not propaganda… But after 21 months of its reporters taking its cues from Hamas’s public relations operations, we should not expect that they will anytime soon.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Israeli Outlets React: </strong><a href="/news-source/haaretz-media-bias">Haaretz (Lean Left)</a> noted in its lede that The Times issued a correction, “but emphasized that he is still malnourished and that ‘children in Gaza are starving.’” <a href="/news-source/jerusalem-post-media-bias">The Jerusalem Post (Center)</a> <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/article-862776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighted</a> that The Times’ offices were vandalized after the correction and criticisms of the paper from Israeli officials.</p>
