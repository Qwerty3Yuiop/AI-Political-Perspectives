Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Joe Biden will host the family of George Floyd at the White House on Tuesday, May 25, one year after&nbsp;George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis. A video of former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racism; last month, Chauvin was found guilty of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. "We will celebrate my brother's life in a very, very special way," George Floyd's sister, Bridgett Floyd, said Thursday as the family prepares to host events with other politicians and activists this week to honor her brother's life. During an address to a joint session of Congress last month, Biden said&nbsp;the Senate would pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act by the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s death; however, congressional sources told Politico that the White House does not expect that the police reform bill to pass soon and that they are waiting on a bipartisan “compromise” agreement. The three other former officers accused of aiding and abetting Chauvin will have trials in March 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Outlets&nbsp;from across the political spectrum covered the story. Some left- and center-rated&nbsp;outlets tended to focus more on the&nbsp;social justice movement following&nbsp;Floyd's death; some right-rated outlets highlighted that Biden's pledge to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is unlikely to pass by Tuesday.&nbsp;</p></div> <h2 class="mb-2 leading-6 text-lg text-gray-500 font-medium mt-4 p-0">
