Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The House select committee investigating the Jan.&nbsp;6 Capitol riot held its third public hearing Thursday.<br />
	<br />
	The seven-Democrat, two-Republican panel focused Thursday's hearing on former President Donald Trump's efforts to convince Vice President Mike Pence to try to change the results of the election in the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6. Committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) praised Pence, saying he "resisted the pressure" and "knew it was wrong." In closed-door testimony released Thursday, former Pence counsel Greg Jacob said that John Eastman, a lawyer advising Trump in the lead-up to the riot, told Trump on Jan. 4 that the push to have Pence reject the election results likely violated the law.<br />
	<br />
	Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, might be the panel's next target. Thompson <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/16/ginni-thomas-jan-6-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told </a>reporters Thursday morning that "it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee." Thomas said she'd accept the invitation.<br />
	<br />
	The hearings continue to be covered much more prominently by left- and center-rated sources than by right-rated sources. Many reports highlighted Thompson's comments on Thomas, and the panel's praise for Pence during Thursday's hearing. Some reports from left-rated sources describe the panel as bipartisan due to its mixed party makeup; right-rated sources do not, likely because both of the panel's Republicans are anti-Trump.</p>
