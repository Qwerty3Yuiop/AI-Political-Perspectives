Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The Pentagon acknowledged&nbsp;the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan on Aug. 29 as a "tragic mistake." U.S. Marines Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, confirmed on Friday that the airstrike&nbsp;killed seven children and&nbsp;three adults, none of whom had known ties to ISIS-K.&nbsp;The strike was arranged based on intelligence that <a href="/story/us-airstrike-kills-two-isis-members">suggested&nbsp;two “high profile” Islamic State militants were planning another attack on the airport in Kabul amid evacuations</a>. Central Command officials observed what they believed were explosives being loaded into a car, which turned out to be containers of water.</p>

<p>The news was prominently covered across the spectrum. Some outlets linked back to previous reports that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested there was no ISIS bomb</a>, highlighting how Central Command officials didn't change their "original narrative." Coverage from right-rated outlets oftenb framed President Joe Biden and military leadership in a negative light, with some accusing them of war crimes.</p>
