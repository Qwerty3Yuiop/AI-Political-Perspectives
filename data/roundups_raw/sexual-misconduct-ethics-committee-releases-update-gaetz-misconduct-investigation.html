Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The House Ethics Committee released an update on its continued investigation of alleged misconduct by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) involving illicit drug use, sexual misconduct, and improper gifts to individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The Ethics Committee's update appears to clarify recent news reports about the probe, noting that despite challenges in obtaining information from Gaetz and others, they had issued 25 subpoenas, reviewed thousands of documents, and interviewed over a dozen witnesses. One woman, <a href="/news-source/abc-news-media-bias">ABC News (Lean Left bias)</a> reported, “told the committee that a payment from Gaetz was for sex,” while other women said the payment was for attending parties “that featured drugs and sex.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Gaetz has continually denied the allegations, including those of paying for sex with a minor, and has previously called them part of an effort to recategorize his generosity towards his ex-girlfriends as something more untoward. Gaetz previously blamed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) for orchestrating continued scrutiny of his conduct.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Coverage was common across the spectrum on Tuesday and Wednesday, often similarly highlighting the alleged sexual misconduct and Gaetz’s denial of wrongdoing. Some coverage exhibited partisan differences; <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias) </a>put “sexual misconduct” in quotes and highlighted Gaetz’s denial in its tagline, while the <a href="/news-source/daily-beast-media-bias">Daily Beast (Left bias)</a> used the word “teenagers” instead of “minors,” making the allegations sound more salacious.&nbsp;<a href="/blog/how-allsides-news-team-uses-ai"><em>This summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.</em></a></p>
