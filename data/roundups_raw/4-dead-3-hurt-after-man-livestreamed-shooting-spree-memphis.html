Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>On Thursday morning, a&nbsp;19-year-old man was taken into custody on suspicion of <strong>shooting and killing four people</strong> and <strong>injuring at least three others</strong> in Memphis on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The suspect, Ezekiel Kelly, reportedly <strong>livestreamed the shootings</strong> on Facebook before crashing a stolen car and being arrested with two guns in the car.&nbsp;Kelly has a <strong>previous criminal history</strong>; he was sentenced to three years in prison for aggravated assault in April 2021 and was released in March after serving 11 months.&nbsp;He is now being charged with first-degree murder, along with multiple felony charges.</p>

<p>During the two-hour manhunt, police warned the approximately 630,000 Memphis residents to <strong>shelter in place</strong>, as university campuses were locked down and public bus services were suspended. The shooting comes as Memphis was rattled by the <a href="/news/2022-09-08-0751/disturbing-details-emerge-death-jogger-eliza-fletcher-suspect-arraigned-murder">abduction and murder of mother and teacher Eliza Fletcher</a> last week.</p>

<p>The shootings were a top story from sources across the political spectrum Thursday morning. Right-rated outlets tended to place<strong> more emphasis on the suspect's criminal history.</strong></p>
