Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index</a> rose&nbsp;by 6.8% in the year through June, <strong>the fastest rate&nbsp;since 1982.</strong><br />
	<br />
	The PCE <strong>measures&nbsp;the prices that people in the United States pay for goods and services</strong>, and is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge for price inflation.&nbsp;Core prices, which exclude the more volatile measurements of food and energy, rose 0.6% from the previous month and 4.8% on an annual basis, according to the Commerce Department. Both numbers were higher than economists predicted.<br />
	<br />
	A <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/eci.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate report</a> released Friday by the Labor Department showed that&nbsp;<strong>employers spent 5.1% more on compensating workers</strong> in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period a year earlier, which marked the fastest annual pace on records back to 2001.<br />
	<br />
	Left- and center-rated sources often <strong>highlighted the wage growth</strong> more prominently than right-rated sources did, which instead tended to <strong>focus primarily on high inflation</strong>. A <a href="/news-source/wall-street-journal-media-bias">Wall Street Journal (Center bias)</a> report said the wage increases are "keeping pressure on historically high inflation." A New York Times report said Friday's numbers are "likely to keep the central bank on track for future <a href="/story/fed-second-interest-rate-increase-combat-inflation">rate increases</a>." A Fox Business report said the compensation growth was "another troubling indication that inflation is broadening throughout the economy."</p>
