Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Thursday that she will step down from her role as democratic house leader, remaining in congress as a rank-and-file member and serving as a mentor for rising members of the party.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes:</strong> Addressing congress, Pelosi stated, “with great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek re-election to Democratic leadership in the next Congress.” She added, “for me the hour's come for a new generation to lead the democratic caucus that I so deeply respect. And I am grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.” She will remain in congress, “speaking for the people of San Francisco, serving the great state of California and defending our Constitution.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context:</strong> In October, Pelosi’s husband was hospitalized after being <a href="/story/politics-nancy-pelosi-discusses-attack-husband-says-it-will-influence-retirement-decision">beaten with a hammer</a> by a home intruder allegedly looking for the House Speaker. The announcement comes one day after the <a href="/story/2022-elections-republicans-secure-slim-majority-house-representatives">Republican Party secured a majority</a> in the House of Representatives. Pelosi has led the house democrats since 2003 and served two four-years terms as house speaker.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>The announcement was covered across the spectrum, with most outlets connecting the attack on Paul Pelosi to her decision to step down as leader. Articles speculated who will take up the reins of leadership in the party and listed the accomplishments made by Pelosi during her two-decades as leader.&nbsp;</p>
