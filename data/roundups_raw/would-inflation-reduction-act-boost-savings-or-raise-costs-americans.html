</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Democrats working to pass the <a href="/story/manchin-schumer-strike-deal-670b-spending-package">'Inflation Reduction Act'</a>&nbsp;face&nbsp;<strong>claims that the bill would lead to higher costs</strong> for Americans.<br />
	<br />
	The bill aims to raise billions of dollars over the next decade to reduce debt and fund climate change and energy programs.&nbsp;An <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/jct_distributional_effects_inflation_reduction_act.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)</a>&nbsp;suggests it&nbsp;would <strong>raise $16.7 billion in tax revenue from Americans earning less than $200,000/year</strong> in 2023 and would raise taxes by $326 billion in the next decade. The analysis <strong>also suggests that tax increases will be frontloaded</strong>, and that by 2027, hikes for many income groups will ease. The <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-joint-committee-taxation-manchin-schumer-taxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House</a> and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen</a> rebuked&nbsp;reports that Americans making less than $400,000/year would see higher taxes, which would break a 2020 campaign pledge from President Joe Biden.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Left- and&nbsp;right-rated sources framed fiscal analysis of the bill very differently. </strong>The <a href="/news-source/new-york-times">New York Times (Lean Left bias)</a> said the JCT report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/biden-climate-tax-bill-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed </a>the bill "would not cement a giant tax increase or result in profligate federal spending." Yahoo News highlighted research that suggested the bill "would save the average household $1,800 per year on energy bills." Conversely, Fox Business said the report showed that "every tax bracket would pay more in taxes," and the <a href="/news-source/wall-street-journal-opinion">Wall Street Journal Editorial Board (Lean Right bias)</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-schumer-manchin-tax-increase-on-everyone-wages-manufacturers-jct-democrats-income-salaries-corporate-rate-11659300317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called </a>the proposed bill "a tax increase on nearly every American." Many on the right juxtaposed the purported tax increases&nbsp;with Biden's tax-increase campaign pledge.</p>
