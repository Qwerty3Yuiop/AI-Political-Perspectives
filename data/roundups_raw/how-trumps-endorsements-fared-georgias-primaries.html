Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Former President Donald Trump's influence over the Republican Party was put to the test Tuesday in Georgia's <a href="/topics/2022-elections">2022 midterm election primaries</a>.<br />
	<br />
	Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) defeated businessman and former Sen.&nbsp;David Perdue, who was backed by former President Donald Trump, in the <a href="/tags/2022-georgia-gubernatorial-election?search=2022%20georgia%20gubernatorial%20election">Republican Gubernatorial Primary&nbsp;in Georgia</a>.&nbsp; Kemp will face politician and lawyer Stacey Abrams in November.&nbsp; Herschel Walker, who was also backed by Trump, safely won the&nbsp;<a href="/tags/2022-georgia-senate-election?search=2022%20georgia%20senate%20election">Republican Senate Primary in Georgia</a>, and will face Democratic Sen.&nbsp;Raphael Warnock&nbsp;in November.<br />
	<br />
	In other primary races Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton defeated Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in the&nbsp;<a href="/tags/2022-texas-attorney-general-election?search=2022%20texas%20attorney%20general%20election">Republican run-off for Texas Attorney General</a>, and former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders won the Republican nomination for Arkansas Governor.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Alabama, Congressman Mo Brooks will face a run-off with attorney Katie Britt for the Republican Senate nomination there.<br />
	<br />
	Georgia's races were the main focus from outlets across the political spectrum. Many left and center-rated sources highlighted&nbsp;Perdue's loss, while some on the right focused&nbsp;on Walker's win and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's victory against a crowded field in the state's 11th Congressional District.&nbsp;Some on the right say it's a&nbsp;mistake to write off Trump's influence, especially in primaries without an incumbent.&nbsp; Kemp, for instance, was able to use his powers to pass legislation that pleased pro-Trump voters, while also rallying the support of state power players in Georgia.</p>
