Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Staff at the Ontario Advanced Surgery Center in California tried to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from arresting a Honduran landscaper this week. A video clip of the altercation was <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1943058148895363459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on social media.</a></p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> Federal immigration agents pursued 30-year-old Denis Guillen-Solis into a surgery center, where clinic staff demanded to see identification and a warrant. The situation escalated as staff physically blocked agents, locked the doors, obstructed vehicles, and reportedly called the police claiming a possible "kidnapping." The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated on X that the ICE officers were conducting a targeted operation to arrest two men who were in the country illegally. Solis was arrested following the standoff.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>ICE has become increasingly public in detaining migrants, conducting operations in immigration courts and workplaces. This incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between federal immigration officers and the public. Solis was sending money to Honduras to help his mother with her dialysis treatments. <a href="/blog/tracking-controversial-deportations-under-trump-administration">Follow our updates on other controversial detainments and deportations</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> focused on quotes from DHS about the incident, emphasizing how the surgery center staff blocked ICE agents. It mentioned other recent incidents between ICE and immigration protestors. <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Left)</a> quoted Javier Hernandez, executive director of the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, who called the staffers “brave”. It also mentioned recent ICE arrests, but highlighted attempts by bystanders and a Catholic bishop to prevent them. Both outlets included the information about Solis' mother.</p>
