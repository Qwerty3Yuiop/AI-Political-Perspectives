Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) addressed criticism toward recent comments he made about segregation.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>The original statement made by Donalds was given at a campaign event for former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia aimed at appealing to black voters. According to the <a href="/news-source/phillycom" target="_blank">Philadelphia Inquirer (Lean Left bias)</a>, Donalds stated that America was seeing the “<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/trump-black-voters-philadelphia-20240604.html" target="_blank">reinvigoration of Black family</a>.” Donalds then added, “You see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together. During Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservative — Black people have always been conservative-minded — but more Black people voted conservatively. And then H.E.W. [Department of Health, Education and Welfare], Lyndon Johnson — you go down that road, and now we are where we are.”</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> During an <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/watch/trump-surrogate-rep-byron-donalds-responds-to-saying-during-jim-crow-the-black-family-was-together-212464197535" target="_blank">interview</a> with <a href="/news-source/msnbc" target="_blank">MSNBC (Left bias)</a>, Donalds stated that the criticism toward his statement was “ridiculous” and accused left-rated outlets of “gaslighting.” Byron added, “Well, listen, under Jim Crow, obviously, Black people were under great persecution, unfortunately by Southern Democrats and the Democrat Party overall, in the history of our country. That’s the fact. So, having the Black man in the home was about first protecting the mom and protecting the kids, incredibly important.” MSNBC host Joy Reid then addressed Donald’s interracial marriage, asking, “During Jim Crow, could your family have existed?” Donald answered, “No, it could not, Joy, and we all know that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Outlets across the spectrum are covering the story, but left-rated outlets are pushing it more prominently with more sensational writing.</p>
