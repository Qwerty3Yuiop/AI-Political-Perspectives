Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Freight rail operators and their unions <strong>reached a tentative agreement</strong> to avoid a <a href="/story/economy-and-jobs-possible-railroad-strike-threatens-hit-us-supply-chains-friday-deadline">massive strike</a> after 20 straight hours of talks.</p>

<p>Negotiations that began in 2019 reached a tipping point this week, with <strong>as many as 60,000 rail workers prepared to strike</strong> over complaints about pay, attendance policies and working conditions. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who helped lead the negotiations, <a href="https://twitter.com/SecMartyWalsh/status/1570338865403117569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> Thursday morning that the deal "balances the needs of workers, businesses, and our nation’s economy."&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AAR_FreightRail/status/1570371826265788416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According </a>to the Association of American Railroads, the new contracts give rail workers a 24% wage increase during the five-year period from 2020 through 2024, including an immediate average payout&nbsp;of $11,000 upon ratification.</p>

<p>The possible strike <strong>sparked fears of more inflation and supply chain issues</strong>, as functioning railways play a critical role in shipping goods. Some disruptions already occurred:&nbsp;Amtrak suspended all long-distance routes, and rail companies CSX and Union Pacific temporarily stopped shipping hazardous materials.</p>

<p>The news was <strong>covered prominently across the political spectrum</strong> Thursday morning.&nbsp;</p>
