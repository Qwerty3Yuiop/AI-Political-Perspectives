Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won the Michigan primaries, inching closer to securing the respective Democratic and Republican nominations and setting up a rematch of the 2020 election.</p>

<p><strong>Democratic Primary:</strong> As of 8:30 CST Tuesday night, Biden held 79.6% of the vote, with “Uncommitted” in second with 14.9%. Prior to the primary, a <a href="/story/2024-presidential-election-what-s-behind-protest-vote-against-biden-michigan-s-tuesday-primary">faction of Michigan residents advocated for Democratic voters in the state to cast a ballot for “uncommitted”</a> to protest President Joe Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza. Author Marianne Williamson earned 2.8% of the vote, and Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) earned 2.7%. This is Biden’s fourth win on the Democratic primary calendar, following wins in ​​South Carolina, Nevada and New Hampshire.</p>

<p><strong>Republican Party:</strong> As of 8:30 CST Tuesday night, Trump held 66% of the vote, with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in second with 29.4%. Haley has <a href="/story/2024-presidential-election-whats-keeping-nikki-haley-race">vowed to continue her campaign to Super Tuesday</a>. This is Trump’s fifth victory on the Republican primary calendar, following wins in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> The “uncommitted” option received heavy coverage, with outlets determining it signifies a divide among the Democratic coalition that could hurt Biden’s chances of securing a second term. The <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">Associated Press (Lean Left bias)</a> also noted that Republicans are facing resistance from members of their party who believe Trump “broke the law in one or more of the criminal cases against him.”</p>
