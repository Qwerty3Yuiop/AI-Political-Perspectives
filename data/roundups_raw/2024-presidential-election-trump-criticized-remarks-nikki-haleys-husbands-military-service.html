Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and Nikki Haley have recently clashed over the former president’s remarks jabbing at Haley’s husband, Major Michael Haley.</p>

<p><strong>The Details: </strong>Michael Haley is a member of the South Carolina Army National Guard and is currently serving in Africa. At a rally on Saturday, Trump told a story in which Haley had told him she would not run against him. Noting Michael Haley’s absence, Trump said, “What happened to her husband? What happened to her husband? Where is he? He’s gone! He knew.” On Tuesday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Haley was “an embarrassment to her wonderful husband, in Africa. I think he should come back home to help save her dying campaign.”</p>

<p><strong>Haley’s Response:</strong> “If you mock the service of a combat veteran, you don’t deserve a driver’s license, let alone being President of the United States,” the former South Carolina governor said at a rally. Michael Haley himself also <a href="https://twitter.com/wmichaelhaley/status/1756442971908550891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hit back at Trump</a> on social media, as did <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1756721310489539060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Joe Biden.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>This is not the first time the former president has come under fire for comments reportedly made about military service members, including controversial reports from <a href="/news/2023-09-21-1546/donald-trump-trumps-reported-disgust-wounded-veteran-sparks-fury-pure-scum">2023</a> and <a href="/story/report-claims-trump-made-disparaging-remarks-about-military-service-members">2020.</a></p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage was common in politics-focused outlets, often separately highlighting remarks from each individual involved in the spat. Some coverage from left-rated outlets was particularly critical of Trump; an opinion published by <a href="/news-source/cnn-editorial">CNN (Opinion rated Left)</a> said there was “no bottom” to Trump’s “vileness.”</p>
