Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Ronna McDaniel has announced that she will step down as RNC Chair on March 8 at the RNC Spring Training in Houston. She is one of the longest-serving&nbsp;chairs in modern history at the RNC.</p>

<p><strong>Key Details</strong>: McDaniel has been the chair of the RNC since 2017 after receiving the support of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump to replace Reince Priebus. She was then re-endorsed by Trump in 2019 and 2021. She was challenged by a handful of candidates for RNC Chair&nbsp;in 2023 after <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4346069-rncs-mcdaniel-faces-mounting-gop-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">critics cited a lack of electoral success</a> and questioned the RNC's spending. Despite those criticisms, McDaniel was again re-elected&nbsp;and has served four terms.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>: "It has been the honor and privilege of my life to serve the Republican National Committee for seven years as Chairwoman to elect Republicans and grow our Party," McDaniel said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: The announcement comes after former President Trump <a href="/story/donald-trump-trump-endorses-whatley-rnc-chair-lara-trump-co-chair">announced</a> he was supporting North Carolina GOP Chair Michael Whatley as the new RNC Chair.&nbsp;Trump is also supporting his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as Co-Chair.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered it</strong>: Some sources on the left noted that McDaniel's resignation is another indication of Trump's status as the&nbsp;Republican Party's de facto leader. Some sources on the right noted McDaniel's long tenure as RNC Chair.</p>
