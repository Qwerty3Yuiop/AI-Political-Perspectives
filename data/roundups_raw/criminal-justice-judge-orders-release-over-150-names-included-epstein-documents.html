Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A federal judge ordered the Jan. 1 release of the names of over 150 people mentioned in documents pertaining to the case of disgraced financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Epstein was a financier convicted of sex trafficking. He had connections to notable figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Bill Gates. Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2019. His death was ruled a suicide.</p>

<p><strong>Details: </strong>Reporters at <a href="/news-source/miami-herald">The Miami Herald (Lean Left bias)</a> have sought the release of the names for several years. The names will reportedly include victims, associates, witnesses, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Epstein’s Death:</strong> Outlets differed in descriptions of Epstein’s death, which was ruled a suicide but spawned theories of foul play. <a href="/news-source/associated-press-media-bias">The Associated Press (Lean Left bias)</a> plainly stated that Epstein “took his own life.” <a href="/news-source/newsweek">Newsweek (Center bias)</a> reported that his “death was ruled an apparent suicide.” <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right bias)</a> reported that his “death was ruled a suicide” along with a note about a Federal Investigation backing up this ruling, despite “finding flaws with the Bureau of Prisons and its staff members.”</p>

<p><strong>The Names:</strong> Outlets characterized the names set to be released differently. AP reported the names will include “sex abuse victims, litigation witnesses, Epstein’s employees — and even some people with only a passing connection to the scandal.” Newsweek reported it will include “former associates and victims.” Fox News reported it will include “associates, victims, investigators and journalists who covered the case.”</p>
