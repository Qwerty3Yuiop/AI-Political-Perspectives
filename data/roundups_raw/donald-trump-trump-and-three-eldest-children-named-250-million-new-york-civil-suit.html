Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><strong>Former President Donald Trump’s legal challenges grew on Wednesday</strong> after he and his three eldest children were named in a $250 million civil lawsuit filed by the Attorney General of New York. The suit alleges Trump and his enterprises overvalued properties and holdings with the intent of gaining favorable loans from lenders. The 214-page filing was the result of a three-year-long investigation into the business practices of the former President.</p>

<p>Upon filing the lawsuit, New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that “with the help of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and cheat the system.”</p>

<p><strong>The Attorney General’s suit seeks repayment of the alleged fraudulently acquired $250 million,</strong> and to ban Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump from serving in corporate executive roles in the state of New York. Additionally, it calls for all four to be removed from their current roles in the Trump Organization, and for the organization to be prohibited from real estate purchases in the state for five years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The announcement was covered wildly across the spectrum, with <a href="/news-source/fox-news-media-bias">Fox News (Right Bias)</a> highlighting a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-ag-trump-lawsuit-political-hit-job-lefts-desire-punish-him-bill-barr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">response</a> from former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, an appointee of Donald Trump, who dismissed the suit, deeming it a “political hit job” from the left.&nbsp;</p>
