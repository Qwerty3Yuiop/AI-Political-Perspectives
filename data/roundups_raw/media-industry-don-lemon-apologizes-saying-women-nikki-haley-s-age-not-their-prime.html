Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p><a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Left bias)</a> host Don Lemon apologized for saying Thursday morning that women over 50, like&nbsp;<a href="/story/politics-can-nikki-haley-win-republican-presidential-nomination">Republican 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley</a>, were not in their “prime.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Lemon Said: </strong>Responding to Haley’s calls for “mental competency tests” for older politicians, Lemon said, “This whole talk about age makes me uncomfortable. I think it’s the wrong road to go down. She says people, you know, politicians or something are not in their prime. Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime. Sorry. A woman is considered to be in their prime in 20s and 30s and maybe 40s.” When CNN This Morning co-host Poppy Harlow pushed back, Lemon deferred to Google, adding, “I’m not saying I agree with that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Response: </strong>Lemon’s remarks were widely criticized. In a fundraising email, Haley wrote, “BTW it’s always the liberals who are the most sexist.” CNN chairman Chris Licht reportedly called Lemon’s words “upsetting, unacceptable, and unfair to his co-hosts” in a Friday morning editorial call. Some reportedly called for CNN to fire Lemon.</p>

<p><strong>Lemon’s Apology: </strong>In a Thursday afternoon <a href="https://twitter.com/donlemon/status/1626288396636225538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, the CNN host wrote that he regretted the remarks, which he said were “inartful and irrelevant,” adding, “A woman’s age doesn't define her either personally or professionally.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>This is not Lemon’s first controversy since losing his prime-time slot at CNN. In December, he reportedly screamed at a co-host off-camera and drew criticism for arguing that the U.S. men’s <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnns-don-lemon-draws-ire-of-kaitlan-collins-and-poppy-harlow-by-crapping-on-womens-soccer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soccer</a> team deserved more pay than the women’s team.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage was widespread across the spectrum, sometimes including direct criticism from media figures.&nbsp;</p>
