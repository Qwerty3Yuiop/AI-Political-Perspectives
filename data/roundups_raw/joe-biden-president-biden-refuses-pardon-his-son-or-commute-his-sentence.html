Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>President Joe Biden publicly refused to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, or to commute <a href="/story/justice-hunter-biden-convicted-3-felony-charges-federal-gun-trial">his currently-undecided sentence for federal gun crimes.</a></p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes: </strong>“I’m extremely proud of my son, Hunter. He’s one of the greatest, most decent men I know, and I am satisfied that I’m not going to do anything I said,” the President stated. “I said I’d abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.” Asked if a commutation was on the table, Biden said, “No.”</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in jail, but he could also merely receive probation. He faces a second federal trial in September for allegations of failing to pay $1.4 million in federal taxes on overseas income between 2016 and 2019.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It:</strong> Coverage was common across the spectrum, with some&nbsp;outlets reflecting partisan attitudes about the Bidens.&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/daily-wire">The Daily Wire (Right bias)</a> highlighted a Trump advisor who said Hunter’s “dad made him ‘the <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-advisor-feels-bad-for-hunter-biden-his-dad-made-him-the-bag-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bag man,</a>’” implying both were corrupt. The <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right bias),</a> which has for years published partially nude photos of Hunter taken from his laptop, highlighted that Joe Biden called him “one of the brightest, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/13/us-news/biden-says-i-will-not-pardon-son-hunter-in-first-remarks-since-gun-conviction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most decent</a> men,” potentially poking fun at the contrast between the quote and reality. Like the Post, some coverage from left-rated outlets prominently noted that the elder Biden said he was “proud” of his son.&nbsp;<a href="/blog/how-allsides-news-team-uses-ai"><em>This summary was developed with the help of AllSides' AI technology.</em></a></p>
