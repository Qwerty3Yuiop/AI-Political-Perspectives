Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Alligator Alcatraz, the new migrant detention center <a href="/story/immigration-floridas-proposed-alligator-alcatraz-inhumane-or-justified">built</a> in the Florida Everglades, has received criticism from politicians and detainees for its allegedly inhumane conditions, including reports that it flooded within a day of opening.</p>

<p><strong>Flood Damage:</strong><a href="/news-source/newsweek"> Newsweek (Center bias)</a> reported on flooding in the facility a day after President Donald Trump visited it to mark its opening. A storm with about 1.5 inches of rainfall led to water seeping into the facility, which is mostly made up of soft-sided tents. Newsweek included videos that a Spectrum News reporter posted on X, which show water seeping onto the floors and pooling around electrical cables and a flagpole inside the tents. Some have questioned the executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management’s claims that they have plans for keeping the facility safe during hurricane season.</p>

<p><strong>Conditions for Migrants:</strong><a href="/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias"> CBS News (Lean Left)</a> spoke with a migrant inside the facility who claimed there was no water available for bathing and that he had not bathed in four days. The migrant said, “They only brought a meal once a day and it had maggots. They never take off the lights for 24 hours. The mosquitoes are as big as elephants.” Another migrant spoke on the same phone call to CBS, saying, “A lot of us have our residency documents, and we don't understand why we're here.”</p>

<p><strong>Government Response:</strong><a href="/news-source/national-desk-media-bias"> The National Desk (Right)</a> noted that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied claims of mistreatment, writing on X that “ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens.” Some have argued that flood and hurricane risk are normal across the state.</p>
