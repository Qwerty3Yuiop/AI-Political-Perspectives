Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>A DeKalb County, Georgia, police officer was killed Friday after a gunman opened fire near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters and Emory University’s campus in Atlanta. The suspect, who was later found dead, targeted the CDC buildings and a CVS pharmacy on the university’s campus.</p>

<p><strong>The Details:</strong> The shooting occurred around 4:50 p.m. ET Friday, when the suspected gunman fired multiple rounds, prompting lockdowns in the area and leaving <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/08/cdc-campus-attacked-kennedy-crisis/#:~:text=At%20least%20four%20buildings%20on,short%20order%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bullet holes in windows</a> of at least four buildings on the CDC’s Roybal Campus near Emory University in Atlanta. The suspect was later found dead from a gunshot wound on the second floor of a CVS pharmacy at Emory Point. According to multiple media reports, the suspect’s father had contacted authorities shortly before the incident, expressing concern that his son was suicidal.</p>

<p><strong>Officer’s Death: </strong>DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose was fatally shot while responding to the gunfire. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition, where he later died. No civilians were injured during the incident. "Officer Rose served DeKalb County with courage, integrity, and unwavering dedication. Even in the face of danger was he diligent in his duty to protect our community," the police department said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DeKalbCountyPD/posts/it-is-with-profound-sadness-and-heavy-hearts-that-we-announce-the-passing-of-off/1080143130921564/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement posted</a> on social media late Friday night.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It: </strong>Coverage of the incident was largely consistent across media outlets. However, <a href="/news-source/abc-news-media-bias">ABC News (Lean Left bias)</a> did not mention allegations from law enforcement that the suspect linked his illness to COVID-19 vaccinations. Instead, its coverage focused on statements from Georgia officials and the death of the responding officer. <a href="/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias">BBC News (Center)</a> also emphasized the service and sacrifice of Officer David Rose, while detailing the swift response of law enforcement agencies. The <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right)</a> highlighted the shooter's alleged belief that the COVID-19 vaccine had made him sick, and used language such as “unhinged” and “deranged” to describe the gunman.</p>
