	<li><a href="/news-source/charlie-kirk-media-bias">Charlie Kirk (Right bias)</a> shared a <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1832883283199471676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>&nbsp;including a story of Haitian immigrants eating a resident's cat.</li>
	<li>In one widely shared <a href="https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1832773191976014217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a>&nbsp;from a Springfield City Commission&nbsp;meeting,&nbsp;a man named Anthony Harris&nbsp;says he witnessed migrants "grabbing up ducks by the neck, cutting the heads off... and eating them."

	<li>Another&nbsp;<a href="http://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1833116060905525332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> claimed to show&nbsp;bodycam footage&nbsp;of a woman "eating a neighbor’s pet cat." Fact checks unanimously&nbsp;concluded that the woman depicted&nbsp;was born in the U.S.</li>
	<li>Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833148904864465117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a>, "Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.

	<li>During his Sept. 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump said migrants are "eating the pets" of other residents,&nbsp;a claim many mainstream news sources&nbsp;labeled false.</li>

<p><strong>Springfield Rebuts</strong>: A city official <a href="https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2024/09/fact-check-haitian-immigrant-was-not-charged-with-eating-a-cat-in-ohio-in-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a>&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/lead-stories-media-bias">Lead Stories (Lean Left)</a>&nbsp;there were "no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused," nor of&nbsp;immigrants "squatting or littering in front of residents' homes" or "deliberately disrupting traffic."</p>

<p><strong>For Context</strong>: In recent years, Haitian immigrants have substantially increased Springfield's population, sparking <a href="/story/immigration-haitian-immigrants-transform-ohio-town-better-or-worse">local controversy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It</strong>: <a href="/news-source/new-york-post">New York Post (Lean Right)</a> rejected the social media claims but pivoted to "real migrant concerns" about overloaded local "services" and a fatal school bus crash. <a href="/news-source/politifact">PolitiFact (Lean Left)</a> noted that Harris is a self-described influencer, but many right-rated outlets merely called him a&nbsp;"resident." Some, especially left-rated sources, omitted details about the police report and resident testimonies&nbsp;while describing the claims as "baseless."&nbsp;<em>Updated 9/16/24 at 8:58 am ET</em></p>
