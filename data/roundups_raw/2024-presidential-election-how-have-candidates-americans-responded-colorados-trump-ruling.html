Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>How have 2024 candidates and Americans responded to the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to <a href="/blog/trump-ineligible-hold-public-office">remove former President Donald Trump</a> from the state’s Republican primary ballot?</p>

<p><strong>For Context: </strong>On Tuesday, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled Trump is ineligible to hold public office again, determining that he violated the 14th Amendment by allegedly aiding in insurrection against the government in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Trump is appealing the decision, and it is expected to be taken up by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p><strong>Politicians:</strong> President Joe Biden refrained from giving his opinion on the ruling but reiterated his stance on Trump’s actions, stating, “Whether the 14th Amendment applies or not, we’ll let the court make that decision. But he certainly supported an insurrection. There’s no question about it. None. Zero. And he seems to be doubling down on it.” Trump responded in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111619029800271297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Truth Social</a>, stating, “I’m not an Insurrectionist,” and adding, “Crooked Joe Biden is!!!” Trump’s opponents in the Republican primary have voiced opposition to the ruling, with Vivek Ramaswamy going so far as to pledge to remove his name from the Colorado ballot in protest and calling on the other primary candidates to join him.</p>

<p><strong>The Public:</strong> A poll conducted by YouGov found that a slim majority of Americans support the decision by the Colorado Supreme Court. Of those polled, 54% said they “strongly” or “somewhat” supported the ruling, and 35% said they “strongly” or “somewhat” disapproved. 84% of Democrats and 24% of Republicans supported the ruling.</p>
