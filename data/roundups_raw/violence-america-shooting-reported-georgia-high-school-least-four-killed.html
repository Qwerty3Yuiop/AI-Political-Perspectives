<p><strong>The Shooting</strong>: Two students and two teachers&nbsp;were killed, and nine others were transported to local hospitals with injuries. The suspected shooter, 14-year-old student Colt Gray, is in law enforcement custody. Multiple law enforcement officials <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/apalachee-high-school-shooting-georgia-09-04-24#h_2b9234957810f668ee5b68f74f3deeeb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a>&nbsp;<a href="/news-source/cnn-media-bias">CNN (Lean Left bias)</a>&nbsp;that a phone call&nbsp;Wednesday morning had warned the school that it would be targeted in a shooting, along with four other schools. Gray will make his first <a href="/news/2024-09-05-0848/violence-america-latest-georgia-high-school-shooting">court appearance on Friday</a>. He <a href="/news/2024-09-05-0846/violence-america-suspect-georgia-school-shooting-was-interviewed-authorities">was interviewed</a> by local authorities last year regarding anonymous tips about threats of a school shooting.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quotes</strong>:&nbsp;“We cannot continue to accept this as normal,” said President Biden in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/04/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-shooting-at-apalachee-high-school-in-georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, calling on Republicans to&nbsp;“work with Democrats to pass common-sense gun safety legislation.” Georgia Governor Brian Kemp <a href="https://x.com/GovKemp/status/1831359448209834275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a>&nbsp;“all Georgians to join my family in praying for the safety of those in our classrooms.”</p>

<p><strong>How the Media Covered It</strong>: Sources on the left&nbsp;were more likely to include statements from Biden, Harris, and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) calling for increased gun regulation, and many&nbsp;tied in&nbsp;statistics such as the number of mass shootings across the country&nbsp;this year to date.</p>
