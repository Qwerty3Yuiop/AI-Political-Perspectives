Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>The House's select Jan.&nbsp;6 Committee says it has evidence that former President Donald Trump and his campaign team engaged in criminal conduct in their attempts to <a href="/blog/facts-vs-myths-was-2020-election-stolen">overturn&nbsp;the results of the 2020 presidential election</a>.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	The findings, which were made public late Wednesday&nbsp;in a 61-page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21321582-house-select-committee-filing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">court filing</a> by the mostly Democratic committee, included excerpts of numerous depositions from top aides to Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence. The findings were released as part of the committee's efforts to obtain critical emails from&nbsp;John Eastman, an attorney who was involved in Trump's strategy to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/30/politics/kfile-john-eastman-said-pence-could-throw-election-to-house/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">persuade Pence to refuse to certify the Electoral College results</a>.&nbsp; Eastman so far has claimed attorney-client privilege.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A judge overseeing the civil lawsuit would review the emails to decide if they should stay protected, since the House cannot bring criminal charges.&nbsp; The committee will, however, consider passing along any evidence of criminal conduct by Trump or his campaign team to the U.S. Justice Department.&nbsp; This symbolic criminal referral would increase political pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge the former president.</p>
