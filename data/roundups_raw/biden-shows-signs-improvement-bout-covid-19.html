Summary from the AllSides News Team
</h2> <div class="mt-2 text-md editor-content" data-astro-cid-fjd3bvuv><p>Kevin O'Connell, the physician of&nbsp;President Joe Biden, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Update-7.24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said </a>Sunday that <strong>Biden's COVID-19 symptoms "continue to improve significantly</strong>" after three days of Paxlovid treatment for the BA.5 variant.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	The president <a href="/story/joe-biden-tests-positive-covid-19">tested positive on Thursday</a> after giving a <a href="/story/biden-announces-executive-actions-climate-change-stops-short-declaring-emergency">speech about climate change</a> in Massachusetts. White House COVID Coordinator Ashish Jha said Sunday that none of the 17 people who came in close contact with Biden,&nbsp;including First Lady Jill Biden, have contracted the virus.&nbsp; Jha also stated that Biden had an upper respiratory infection, and O'Connell also said that Biden is not experiencing shortness of breath. Biden has been vaccinated and twice boosted, and is <strong>currently isolating in the White House</strong> until Tuesday, pending a negative COVID-19 test.<br />
	<br />
	Biden's bout with the illness has been covered prominently across the political spectrum.&nbsp;Some right-rated sources, like Breitbart and Fox News,&nbsp;focused&nbsp;more&nbsp;on <a href="/news/2022-07-25-0733/biden-battles-covid-some-health-issues-past-us-presidents-were-kept-hidden">Biden's continued health symptoms</a> and how the health of former Presidents was covered.</p>
