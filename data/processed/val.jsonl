The executive action would transfer the cost of the loans to the American public.\n\nThe president’s order would cost $300 billion if enacted,accordingto an estimate by the Wharton School of business at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nJCNF sued on behalf of two borrowers, one who had private student loans that were ineligible for the “forgiveness” and the other who wasn’t a recipient of a Pell Grant and therefore didn’t qualify for an extra $10,000 in forgiveness. Pittman found that the plaintiffs had not been allowed to voice their disagreement with the specifics of the program under the usual regulatory process.\n\nElaine Parker, the president of Job Creators Network Foundation, responded to the ruling in a statement on Thursday, saying the decision “protects the rule of law which requires all Americans to have their voices heard by their federal government.”\n\n‘This attempted illegal student loan bailout would have done nothing to address the root cause of unaffordable tuition: greedy and bloated colleges that raise tuition far more than inflation year after year while sitting on $700 billion in endowments,” Parker added. “We hope that the court’s decision today will lay the groundwork for real solutions to the student loan crisis.”\n\nLast month, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the student loan “forgiveness” plan. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted an administrative stay in response to a challenge to the order by a coalition of six Republican-led states.\n\nThe court’s order instructed the Biden administration not to begin “forgiving” student-loan debt as it considers a request for an injunction from the six states.\n\nSend a tip to the news team atNR.\n\nDel Toro’s remake refuses to grow up.\n\nThe longer Congress writes laws that read like mission statements, the more frustrated voters will be when the mission goes sideways.\n\nThe Sierra Club is a cautionary tale.\n\nFor a few years, the all-volunteer military construct was failing.

Additionally, some victors emerged from primary races that were left uncalled from last week, ousting one House Republican who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump last year.\n\nFULL COVERAGE OF THE 2022 MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nHere are the biggest results from last night’s primary elections:\n\nTrump-backed candidate wins another proxy war against Pence endorsee\n\nTim Michels wonthe Republican nomination for Wisconsin’s governor, setting the stage for what is expected to be one of the toughest elections this year with implications for how the 2024 presidential election will be carried out in the crucial swing state.\n\nThe Republican-controlled legislature has repeatedly tried to pass tighter election laws over the last few years that have been blocked by incumbent Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, prompting several GOP candidates to vie to oust him in November. The stakes are seen as particularly high because of Wisconsin’s status as a battleground state — one that helped secure President Joe Biden’s victory in 2020.\n\nThe primary race marks another personal victory for Trump after the election was seen as the latest proxy war between him and former Vice President Mike Pence, who backed Michels’s challenger Rebecca Kleefisch.\n\nAnother pro-impeachment Republican bites the dust\n\nTrumpsecured another personal winTuesday night after Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former president after the Jan. 6 riot, lost her seat to a Trump-endorsed Army veteran Joe Kent.\n\nThe 12-year incumbent conceded the race on Tuesday after vote-tabulating dragged on for a week, with Herrera Beutler finishing in third place. Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez clinched a spot on the November ballot by coming in first, while Kent advanced to second place after a week of counting the votes.\n\nHerrera Beutler is the third House Republican to lose her reelection bid after impeaching Trump, joining the ranks of Reps. Peter Meijer (R-MI) and Tom Rice (R-SC).\n\n‘Squad’ member narrowly survives reelection bid\n\nAll eyes were on Minnesota late Tuesday night as Rep.

Samuels conceded late Tuesday but warned that coming that close “means that we have our finger on the pulse of the exhausted majority.”\n\nWinning the primary election was crucial for Omar because the Democratic nominee typically prevails in the general election in the solidly blue district.\n\nLongtime GOP lawmaker in Wisconsin prevails against Trump-backed candidate\n\nDespite victories elsewhere, Trump was not successful in all his bids to oust his critics from office. Wisconsin’s longtime Assembly Speaker Robin Vossurvived his reelection bidafter the former president endorsed challenger Adam Steen because of Vos’s refusal to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the state.\n\nVos had hired a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice to look into the 2020 election and later revealed Trump asked him in July to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory. However, Vos maintained that decertification of the election results would be unconstitutional.\n\nSteen was narrowly leading Voz early in the night, but the incumbent managed to pull ahead after 10 p.m. to claim the victory.

Their arrival is part of a broader, unprecedented increase in migration from outside Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose citizens accounted for the vast majority of migrants processed by U.S. border officials before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore than 25,000 Venezuelans entered U.S. border custody in August, a monthly record, making Venezuela the second-largest source of migrants to the southern border, behind Mexico.\n\nNearly 7 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland as part of the largest displacement crisis in the Western Hemisphere, according to theUnited Nations. While many settled in other South American nations like Colombia, Venezuelans hoping to reach the U.S. have been crossing the Darien Gap, Panama's roadless jungle, in record numbers over the past month, Panamaniangovernment datashow.\n\nCBP officials along the U.S.-Mexico border also processed more than 19,000 Cubans and nearly 12,000 Nicaraguans in August.\n\nUnlike Mexicans and most Central Americans, the U.S. cannot generally deport Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico or their home countries because of limits placed by Mexico and strained diplomatic relations with the authoritarian governments in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Because of this, most migrants from these countries are processed and then released so they can continue their asylum cases inside the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration has attributed the mass exodus from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua to the policies of their leftist regimes and the dire economic circumstances faced by many people there.\n\n\"Failing communist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba are driving a new wave of migration across the Western Hemisphere, including the recent increase in encounters at the southwest U.S. border,\" CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said in a statement Monday.\n\nThis year's unprecedented migration wave has created formidable operational and humanitarian challenges for the Biden administration, which came into office promising to create a more humane immigration system, including through the reversal of several Trump-era hardline border policies.\n\nIn El Paso, Texas, for example, U.S. border officials have been recently forced to release hundreds of migrants into the city because the holding capacity at its facilities has been exhausted.\n\nThe record levels of border apprehensions have also become a political liability for the Biden administration, with Republicans in Congress and in governors' mansions across the country accusing it of being too lenient on migrants who enter the country unlawfully.\n\nThe political showdown over border policy has intensified this month due to efforts by Republican governors in Texas and Florida totransport migrantsto certain Democratic-led jurisdictions, including Washing..."}

(Jerry Lara/The San Antonio Express-News via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says it’s granting temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who are already in the country — quickly making them eligible to work — as it grapples with growing numbers of people fleeing the South American country and elsewhere to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe move — along with promises to accelerate work permits for many migrants —may appease Democratic leaderswho have pressured the White House to do more to aid asylum seekers, while also providing grist for Republicans who say the President Joe Biden has been too lax on immigration.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department plans to grant Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans who arrived in the country as of July 31, making it easier for them to get authorization to work in the U.S. That’s been a key demand of Democratic mayors and governors who are struggling to care for an increased number of migrants in their care.\n\nThat’s in addition to about 242,700 Venezuelans who already qualified for temporary status before Wednesday’s announcement.\n\nThe protections for Venezuelans are significant because they account for such a large number of the migrants who have been arriving in the country in recent years.\n\nVenezuela plunged into a political, economic and humanitarian crisis over the last decade, pushing at least 7.3 million people to migrate and making food and other necessities unaffordable for those who remain. The vast majority who fled settled in neighboring countries in Latin America, but many began coming to the United States in the last three years through the notoriously dangerous Darien Gap, a stretch of jungle in Panama.\n\nVenezuelans who arrive in the U.S. after July 31 of this year will not be eligible for the protection. Those who are now eligible have to apply to get it.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas granted the expansion and an 18-month extension for those who already have temporary status due to “Venezuela’s increased instability and lack of safety due to the enduring humanitarian, security, political, and environmental conditions,” the department said in a statement.\n\nThe administration said it would accelerate work authorizations for people who have arrived in the country since January through a mobile app for appointments at land crossings with Mexico, called CBP One, orthrough parole granted to Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who have financial sponsors and arrive at an airport. It will aim to give them work permits within 30 days, compared with about 90 days currently.\n\nThe promise of accelerated work permits does not apply to people who cross the border illegally and seek asylum, who, by law, must wait for six months to receive work permits.\n\nMayors and governors have been clamoring for Biden to figure out a way to get newly arrived migrants to be able to work legally, so they can support themselves.\n\nDemocratic officials in New York,Massachusetts, Chicago and elsewhere havecomplained about the strainthat newly arrived migrants are putting on their resources, especially in New York, where the government is required to provide housing for anyone who needs it. The city is currently paying to house about 60,000 newly arrived migrants.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement late Wednesday that she was “grateful the federal government has acted so speedily to grant one of our top priorities: Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelan asylum seekers and migrants who have already arrived in this country.”\n\nThe city’s mayor, Eric Adams, has been especially critical of the Biden administration. But Adams on Wednesday praised the decision to grant protections to Venezuelans and thanked the administration for listening to the city’s concerns.\n\nThe number of migrants trying to cross the southern border is rising. That poses a severe challenge for the administration, which has struggled to show it is in control of the border ..."}

Joe Manchin on Sunday said he would oppose his party’s sprawling voting rights bill — because he believes it would divide the country.\n\nIn an op-edin his home state’s Gazette-Mail, the moderate Manchin announced his rejection of the Democrat-pushed For the People Act — known as S1 — which is stalled in the Senate after theHouse green-litit in March along party lines.\n\n“Today’s debate about how to best protect our right to vote and to hold elections … is not about finding common ground, but seeking partisan advantage,” the West Virginia senator wrote.\n\n“Whether it is state laws that seek to needlessly restrict voting or politicians who ignore the need to secure our elections, partisan policymaking won’t instill confidence in our democracy — it will destroy it.\n\n“The right to vote is fundamental to our American democracy and protecting that right should not be about party or politics,” he went on. “Least of all, protecting this right, which is a value I share, should never be done in a partisan manner.”\n\nThe bill would allow felons who have served their time in prison to vote, loosen voter ID requirements, and require states to offer mail-in ballots, same-day voter registration, as well as 15 days of early voting.  Additionally, the legislation would mandate that states establish nonpartisan redistricting commissions and broaden disclosure rules on campaign advertisement spending, in order to reduce influence of dark money in politics.\n\nManchin — speaking of theproposed election overhaulbacked by Present Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — said he also didn’t back the legislation because it includes measures unrelated to allowing more Americans to head to the polls.\n\n“There are a lot of things that don’t pertain directly to voting,” Manchin said on “Fox News Sunday.\n\nHe added the bill would further “divide” the country.\n\n“It’s the wrong piece of legislation to bring our country together and unite our country, and I’m not supporting that because I think it would divide us more,” he said. “I don’t want to be in a country that’s divided any further.”\n\nRepublicans have criticized the effort, saying it’s designed to help Democrats win elections.\n\n“Democrats want to use their razor-thin majority not to pass bills to earn voters’ trust, but to ensure they don’t lose more seats in the next election,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in March of the House bill, which would lower several barriers to voting.\n\nAlso Sunday, Manchin reiterated hisoppositionto eliminate the filibuster.\n\n“I’m going to continue to keep working with my bipartisan friends,” he told host Chris Wallace. “There were 33 Democrats in 2017 that signed a letter to please save the filibuster and save our democracy. That’s what I’m trying to do.”\n\n“I’m just very hopeful and I see good signs. “Give us some time.”\n\nMeanwhile, Manchin said he was hopeful Senate Democrats and Republicans can come to a bipartisan compromise on an infrastructure spending plans.\n\n“I think we can come to that compromise,” he said on Fox. “I have all confidence in the world we’re going to get there.”\n\nStrictly necessary cookies are essential for the website to function correctly.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Education Does Sat Make College Admissions Process More Fair", "output": "ByFrederick Hess\n\nByFrederick Hess,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nDartmouth College announced this week that it’ll be reinstating itsSAT requirement, starting with students applying for fall 2025 admission. That makes it the first Ivy League institution to do so after all eight dropped their requirements in response to the pandemic and concerns about equity. Those institutions were in good company, with most of the nation’s selective colleges either waiving admissions tests or going “test-optional” in recent years.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Dartmouth’s decision (which follows a similar move by MIT last year) is a heartening development. Especially amidst rampant high schoolgrade inflation,suspect campus practices, and theflagrant abuse of letters and essaysby those who know how the game works, tests like the SAT or ACT can operate as a much-needed reality check. As Dartmouth president Sian Beilock explained in an email to the campus community, the decision reflected a faculty study which concluded that “standardized test scores are an important predictor of a student’s success in Dartmouth’s curriculum” whatever the “student’s background or family income.”\n\nDartmouth economics professor Bruce Sacerdote, who helped lead the faculty study,explained, “We’re getting more and more applications from all around the world, and so in order to find high achieving students, test scores turn out to be a really helpful tool.” He said, “Our analysis shows that we potentially miss out on some great applicants when we don’t have [test scores].”\n\nWhatever qualms activists may have about admissions tests, that kind of arm’s-length gauge is a crucial component of any merit-based, fair-minded admissions system. Heck, as I’ve noted before, last year a survey of four-year college students found that more than 60 percentsaidthey’d lied on their applications about things like their race, high school activities, and personal experiences.\n\nIndeed, contrary to theclaimsof anti-testingideologues, Harvard University’s Raj Chetty hasreportedthat selective colleges that embrace admissions testing aremorelikely to enroll low-income students than those which rely on grades, interviews, essays, and other similar inputs. This really shouldn’t be too surprising, given that it’s affluent, highly-educated parents who are best positioned to enroll their kids in resume-bolstering programs, intensively “edit” their application essays, hire college consultants, write big checks, and leverage legacy admissions or professional networks.\n\nAdmissions tests like the SAT and ACT offer an independent snapshot of college readiness and academic preparation. Without admissions tests to put grades into context, colleges can have a harder time keeping an eye on schools, which may hand out high grades or play transcript games in order to help their students get into college. Tests like the SAT and ACT can help level the playing field by providing a check on such machinations.\n\nWhile those seeking to ditch the SAT and ACT insist that these tests are unfair and unequitable, they’d do well to consider the alternatives. Indeed, the SAT was devised precisely because the test-free world was anything but fair.\n\nAs Columbia University’s Nick Lemannexplainedin “The Big Test,” a century ago, Ivy League students were admitted less on the basis of academic ability than for possessing “money and the right background.\" That state of affairs prompted Harvard’s reform-minded president James Conant to propose a standardized assessment that would help admit students based on academic merit rather than connections.\n\nThe result was the SAT and a dramatic blow on behalf of access and opportunity. As McGill historian Gil Troy hasnoted, the SAT “mock[ed]” supposed “biological distinctions” and allowed “talented immigrants and minorities [to] breach the elite’s ivy-covered bunkers.” In 1959, Everett Franklin Lindquist, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, developed the ACTto servea broader range of students and institutions than the SAT.\n\nThe SAT and ACT were created todemocratizehigher education. They still play that role today. Testing helps to level the playing field and ensure that all students, whatever their family connections and wherever they attended high school, have a chance to demonstrate their aptitude and college readiness. Put another way, tests like these serve topromoteequity andcounterprivilege. That’s a message that should resonate today, not just in Hanover, New Hampshire, but on college campuses far and wide."}

Please check your inbox to confirm.\n\nAssociated PressAssociated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Trading accusations, Democratic and Republican senators quarreled Tuesday over who will testify at what promises to be a dramatic and emotional hearing next Monday with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who says he sexually assaulted her when they were in high school. But doubts were raised whether she would appear.\n\nKavanaugh was at the White House for a second straight day, but again did not meet with President Donald Trump. The president said he was “totally supporting” Kavanaugh and rejected calls for the FBI to investigate the accusation.\n\n“I don’t think FBI really should be involved because they don’t want to be involved,” Trump said. As for Kavanaugh, he said, “I feel so badly for him that he’s going through this, to be honest with you. … This is not a man that deserves this.”\n\nDemocrats are demanding that the FBI be given time to reopen its background investigation into Kavanaugh so it can check the assertions of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Kavanaugh of assault. They say the hearing should not move forward until that investigation is completed.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said an FBI investigation is “essential” to prevent the hearing from becoming merely a “he said, she said affair.”\n\nRepublicans responded that reopening the investigation is up to the White House and they are sticking with their plans for a Monday hearing — with or without Ford’s participation.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on radio’s “Hugh Hewitt Show” said that he’d not yet received confirmation from Ford that she would appear at the hearing, despite several attempts to reach her camp.\n\n“So it kind of raises the question, do they want to come to the public hearing or not?” Grassley said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh’s who Ford claims witnessed the assault, said Tuesday he does not wish to testify before the committee.\n\n“I have no memory of this alleged incident. … More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes,” he said in a statement sent to the committee by his lawyer. “I have no more information to offer the committee and I do not wish to speak publicly regarding the incidents described in Dr. Ford’s letter.”\n\nA day earlier, Republicans abruptly agreed to hold a public Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and Ford have been invited to testify. Party leaders made that concession under pressure from senators demanding that the nominee and his accuser give public, sworn testimony before any vote on Trump’s nominee.\n\nSchumer said Democrats want more than two witnesses, including Mark Judge. Limiting the hearing to just Kavanaugh and Ford would be “inadequate, unfair, wrong and a desire not to get at the whole truth,” Schumer said.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said Judge is needed “specifically and personally as an eyewitness to the occurrence. He should testify under oath.”\n\nREAD MORE: How the sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh unfolded, in one timeline\n\nAs both sides contemplated the hearing, Republicans were thinking through the optics of a nationally televised showdown between Kavanaugh and his accuser at which all 11 GOP Judiciary Committee members are men.\n\n“There is no discussion of a Plan B” should Kavanaugh’s nomination fail, according to an individual familiar with the nomination process but not authorized to speak publicly. The person said there should be no such discussion until more information about the alleged incident comes to light.\n\nThe hearing is certain to be conflicting and emotive. It will offer a campaign season test of the political potency of a #MeToo movement that has already toppled prominent men from entertainment, government and journalism and energized female voters and political candidates.\n\nAsked by Hewitt if he was considering including a female counsel who would ask questions, Grassley said, “All those things are being taken into consideration.” He added later, “You’re raising legitimate questions that are still in my mind.”\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who is on the Judiciary Committee, said Republicans are “naturally” concerned about the optics of having only Republican men question Ford “because there’s always a lot of prejudice in these matters.”\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stood strongly behind Brett Kavanaugh, saying her claims that he’d sexually attacked her when both were high schoolers “stands at odds” with everything known about the Supreme Court nominee’s background.\n\nMcConnell said that “blatant malpractice” by Democrats — not releasing a letter by the accuser until the confirmation process was nearing its end — “will not stop the Senate from moving forward in a responsible manner.”\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein talks to reporters about the Supreme Court nomination of Jud..."}

With the return of Majority LeaderSteve Scaliseto bolster the GOP’s numbers after being away from Washington for cancer care and a Northeastern storm impacting some others, Republicans recouped — despite dissent from their own ranks.\n\nPresident Joe Bidencalled it a “blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.”\n\nThe charges against Mayorkas next go to the Senate for a trial, but neither Democratic nor even some Republican senators have shown interest in the matter and it may be indefinitely shelved to a committee. The Senate is expected to receive the articles of impeachment from the House after returning to session Feb. 26.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the case against Mayorkas a “sham impeachment” and a “new low for House Republicans.”\n\nIn a frantic scene of vote-tallying on the House floor, the GOP effort to impeach Mayorkas over his handling of the southern border took on an air of political desperation as Republicans struggle to make good on their priorities.\n\nMayorkas faced two articles of impeachment filed by the Homeland Security Committee arguing that he “willfully and systematically” refused to enforce existing immigration laws and that he breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was secure.\n\nBut critics of the impeachment effort said the charges against Mayorkas amount to a policy dispute over Biden’s border strategy, hardly rising to the Constitution’s bar of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nThe House had initially launched an impeachment inquiry into Biden over his son’s business dealings, but instead turned its attention to Mayorkas after Georgia Rep.

Bush.\n\nThe Republican former President died on Friday at the age of 94. On Monday, his body was brought to the US Capitol rotunda where Bush will lie in state until Wednesday morning, an honorreservedforgovernment officials and military officers.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans remain locked in a standoff over funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall that could trigger a partial government shutdown in the coming days and Washington is still reeling from a divisive midterm campaign season where the leaders of both parties were targets and Trump frequently went on the attack on the campaign trail.\n\nBut for at least a few hours, the two parties appeared to put their political differences aside.\n\nAs crowds began to gather outside, a ceremony was held inside the rotunda where Capitol Hill’s highest-ranking Republican and Democratic lawmakers joined together in paying tribute to the former President.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stood side-by-side as a wreath was placed alongside the casket. In another image of unity,  House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi did the same several minutes later, standing next to one another as a second wreath was placed.\n\nPelosi, who is vying to become House speaker when Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in the new Congress, stood next to Kevin McCarthy, who will serve as the House Republican leader in the next Congress, as lawmakers filed in at the start of the event and the two could be seen speaking to one another.\n\nEarlier in the day, McConnell and Schumer both gave speeches on the Senate floor praising the former President.\n\n“He embodied the characteristics we admire in a president: integrity, civility, dignity, humility,” Schumer said during his speech. The Senate Democratic leader added, “I knew him to be a fine man. A decent man. And even when he opposed your views, you knew he was doing what he thought was best for the United States of America.”\n\nA long list of prominent current and former officials gathered inside the rotunda to pay their respects.\n\nVice President Mike Pence delivered a speech. Prominent former lawmakers, including former Senate Majority Leader Republican Bill Frist, were seen at the Capitol as were sitting Supreme Court justices, including Clarence Thomas, who was nominated to the bench by Bush.\n\nOutside the Capitol, a long line of people waiting to pay their respects to the 41st President began to form early in the evening. Starting at around 7:30 p.m. ET on Monday, members of the public began to be allowed into the rotunda to view the casket.\n\nJoe McGarvey, a 62-year old Democrat, was one of the people who waited in line to pay his respects to what he described as “a man who gave a life of service to the country.”\n\n“I’m a Democrat, but as President, he did a lot of good things,” McGarvey said during a brief interview. He described Bush as a “very humble, caring person – you could tell, just how he treated people.”\n\nAs McGarvey waited, the temperature began to drop. “It’s getting a little cold here,” he said, “even though I’m standing out here in the cold, I’m glad I did it.”\n\nStephen Keblish and Nate Crossett from Utica, New York said they had driven down to Washington, DC that morning.\n\nKeblish described it as a “once in a lifetime kind of opportunity.”\n\n“It’s a sort of pilgrimage in a way. There aren’t a lot of opportunities for ritual in this day and age especially as a country so I wanted to partake in something like that,” he added.\n\nChristine Dube, who lives in Vermont, but travels to DC periodically for work, said she believes Bush was from an era where people did “the right thing and you care about America and that comes first.”\n\n“I think maybe people need to start thinking about that a bit more,” she said, “following that set of values, not fighting with each other, agreeing to disagree, doing what we’re supposed to do, take care of each other … not be at odds with each other all the time.”\n\n“Our country needs to come together,” Dube said, adding, “Regardless of what your political views are, I think everybody at heart wants to see our country do well.”\n\nAmong those also paying respect Monday evening: the President and first lady Melania Trump, who stood in front of Bush’s casket in the Rotunda at around 8:30 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi, Ted Barrett and Alex Rogers contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

And right now, the world's top currency is taking a big, mighty punch.\n\nThe dollar has slumpedmore than 10% this year, posting its worst decline in the first six months of a year since 1973, back when President Nixonshocked the worldby detaching the dollar's value from gold.\n\nThe decline reverses a long stretch of annual gains for the dollar — and it's especially confounding given that the U.S. economy is still doing well.\n\n\"America was already great,\" says Kaspar Hense, a senior portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management.\n\n\"We are coming from a very strong dollar level where U.S. exceptionalism was what everybody was speaking about in financial markets,\" he adds.\n\nMany investors now fear the decline could reflect a new reality for the U.S., just after the country celebrated its 249th birthday.\n\nA series of chaotic policies and statements by Trump — from tariffs to attacking the Federal Reserve — has shaken some of the confidence investors around the world had long held in the U.S.\n\nBut it goes beyond that. The country's debt is ballooning — and will grow even more with the GOP megabill that was passed by Congress last week. Meanwhile, there are real concerns about what the deep political divisions will mean for the U.S.\n\nThe big question now is: Does this re-assessment reflect a long-term shift or just a momentary blip?\n\nWhether one agrees or disagrees with President Trump, one thing is clear: His second term is shaping up to be quite different — and it's unnerving many investors, both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe chaotic rollout of tariffs has led to widespread uncertainty across businesses in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nBut President Trump has also disregarded other norms. He's picked a fight with the Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates, for example, upending a tradition upheld by most American presidents not to interfere with the independence of the central bank.\n\nAnd at a time when there are already serious concerns about the country's finances President Trump on Independence Daysigned a massive billpassed by Congress last week that will rack up trillions of dollars in additional debt.\n\nOf course, the U.S. debt load has been rising significantly for years ever since President Clinton and Congress managed to balance the budget in the 1990s.\n\nKenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and now a professor at Harvard, says those years of inaction to deal with the rising debt levels are contributing to the dollar's decline.\n\n\"How much do investors want to be overweight in dollars when they can sort of see this slow-motion train wreck coming?,\" he asks. \"While I wouldn't read too much into the dollar's fall this year, there is no question that there is this broader underlying trend of moving away from the dollar — and Trump's been an accelerant.\"\n\nPresident Trump, joined by Republican lawmakers, signs the \"One, Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" a massive spending and tax bill, at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2025.Samuel Corum/Getty Images North Americahide caption\n\nForeign investors have indeed responded — by selling American stocks and bonds, which has pushed the dollar sharply lower. That's because when a foreign investors dump shares in a company for example, they then effectively sell the dollar and convert it back to their home currency.\n\nA widely followed survey by Bank of America of fund managers around the world reflects this selling quite starkly. Fund managers had preferred U.S. stocks over international stocks for most of the past two decades — but that's changed this year.\n\nBut the latest survey out in mid-June showed a startling statistic: Only 23% now preferred U.S. stocks.\n\nThat's amply reflected in how stocks around the world have performed this year.\n\nYes, the S&P has just hit record highs, recovering from steep losses earlier this year, helped by a good performance in sectors like technology. But consider this: Even with the most recent gains the S&P 500 — representing the biggest 500 companies in the U.S. — is up more than 6% this year.\n\nHowever, that compares to both Germany's DAX index and Hong Kon's Hang Seng Index, which are up nearly 20% this year as of the end of last week. Several other international stock markets have also gained significantly.\n\nNot everybody is convinced that the dollar's decline is an alarming trend.\n\nUnder this thinking, the U.S. has gotten used to outperforming global markets for years, so a months-long reversal is not necessarily catastrophic. It's just a re-adjustment that had been coming.\n\nAnd then there's a long-held market adage: TINA, as in, There Is No Alternative.\n\nThe dollar is by fa..."}

The new sections won't be allowed to be marketed to just boys or girls but rather must include a “reasonable selection” of toys that could be marketed to children of either sex.\n\nThe lawwon't require the stores to eliminate their boy- or girl-focused toy sections but rather add to the toy sections to include ones that would reasonably apply to children of any gender.\n\nThe law, passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021, is aimed specifically at retailers with at least 500 employees across their state locations, which excludes smaller stores. Retailers will be fined $250 for not following the law, followed by $500 fines for repeat offenses.\n\nAssembly member Evan Low, a key sponsor of the bill, said in a statement that the measure would make “it easier to compare similar items for sale at large retailers without reinforcing gender stereotypes that harm vulnerable children.”\n\nIllinois will become the first state to enforce a law to outlaw book bans.The lawrequires the state librarian and library staff members to adopt the American Library Association's Library Bill of Rights statewide. The document states that reading materials \"should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or personal disapproval.\" Public libraries that don't adopt the association's language or develop similarly worded prohibitions will be ineligible for state grants.\n\nAn increasing number of books have been banned in several states, with the nonprofit free speech advocacy groupPEN Americafinding 3,362 instances of individual books’ being banned in the 2022-23 school year, affecting 1,557 unique titles—a 33% increase from the previous academic year. The group's report lists Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah and South Carolina as the states where the bans were most prevalent.\n\nPEN America's report said 30% of the banned titles during the first half of the 2022-23 school year were books about race or racism or books that featured characters of color. Another 26% of the banned books had LGBTQ characters or themes. In addition, a wider array of titles have been affected by bans this year — 44% of them portray violence and abuse, 38% discuss topics of health and well-being, and 30% cover death and grief — the result of school districts’ responding to \"vague legislation by removing large numbers of books prior to any formal review,\" the report said.\n\n\"The concept of banning books contradicts the very essence of what our country stands for,\" said Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, who initiated the legislation and serves as the state librarian. \"It also defies what education is all about: teaching our children to think for themselves.\"\n\nNew York state will ban pet stores from selling dogs, cats and rabbits this year to protect the animals from poor treatment and conditions in some commercial breeding operations that critics call \"puppy mills.\" The law doesn't bar the shops from showcasing animals derived from shelters for purposes of adoption, however.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed the legislation in December 2022, saying in a statement, \"I'm proud to sign this legislation, which will make meaningful steps to cut down on harsh treatment and protect the welfare of animals across the state.\"\n\nKevin O’Neill, the vice president of state affairs for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said New York has among the highest concentrations of pet stores that sell cats, dogs and rabbits, making the new law important for animal rights.\n\nThe stores “prioritize profit over actually caring for the animals,” O’Neill said, adding that he believes public opinion has shifted and prospective pet owners want to know where their animals are coming from and whether they are being treated humanely.\n\nThe ASPCA released apoll in April 2022that found that 77% of Americans support federal legislation that would end puppy mills.\n\nJessica Selmer, the president of People United to Protect Pet Integrity, a New York coalition of pet store owners, saidafter the legislationpassedthat the law was “careless” and “counterproductive,” adding that she hopes the governor will “consider legislative remedies to some of the pitfall..."}

The judge noted that Ross claimed in March, when the decision to add the citizenship question was announced, that he considered adding it after a request to do so last December from the Justice Department.\n\n\"The record developed thus far, however, casts grave doubt on those claims,\" the judge wrote in September.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that Ross' reasonings and/or motives are irrelevant, theNew York Timesreported.\n\n“Those reasons include the Justice Department’s view that citizenship data from the decennial census would be helpful to its enforcement duties under the Voting Rights Act,” Noel J. Francisco, the solicitor general, wrote in an emergency application.\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas wanted the Court to go further and completely prohibit pretrial \"fact-gathering\" in this case.\n\n“There’s nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagreeing with staff or cutting through red tape,” Justice Gorsuch wrote. “Of course, some people may disagree with the policy and process. But until now, at least, this much has never been thought enough to justify a claim of bad faith and launch an inquisition into a cabinet secretary’s motives.”\n\nThe Court's decision was brief and gave no reasoning, which is normal in these instances.

Lloyd said the balloon was being used by the People's Republic of China \"in an attempt to surveil strategic sites in the continental United States.\"\n\nBiden gave authorization on Wednesday to take down the balloon as soon as it could be done \"without undue risk to American lives under the balloon's path,\" Lloyd said.\n\n\"In accordance with the President's direction, the Department of Defense developed options to take down the balloon safely over our territorial waters, while closely monitoring its path and intelligence collection activities,\" he said in the statement.\n\nTV footage shows the high-altitude balloon, which is estimated to be the size of three school busses, bursting in a small explosion before falling into the water. Officials will attempt to recover the debris, according to NBC News.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop in parts of North Carolina and South Carolina and closed additional airspace on Saturday afternoon. The departures were paused \"to support the Department of Defense in a national security effort,\" a representative told CNBC. Normal operations began resuming later that afternoon, theFAA said on Twitter.\n\nBidenbroke his silence about the balloon for the first time Saturday, telling a group of reporters, \"We're going to take care of it.\" Later that afternoon, he told reporters that he had instructed officials to \"shoot it down\" on Wednesday, but that they wanted to wait until it was as safe as possible.\n\n\"They successfully took it down, and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,\" Biden said. \"And we'll have more to report on this a little later.\"\n\nThe balloon was initially spotted over Billings, Montana, on Wednesday. Defense officials said the Pentagon considered shooting down the balloon earlier this week but decided against it after briefing Biden. The decision was made in consultation with senior leaders, including Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\nBiden concluded that the U.S. would not shoot down the balloon because debris from it could cause damage on the ground, a Pentagon official said. Moreover, any information the balloon collects would have \"limited additive value\" compared with China's spy satellites.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry said Friday that the balloon was acivilian weather airshipintended for scientific research that was blown off course. It described the incident as a result of a \"force majeure\" for which it was not responsible.\n\nThis claim was summarily dismissed by U.S. officials. A senior Pentagon official told reporters Thursday night that the object was clearly a surveillance balloon that was flying over sensitive sites to collect intelligence.\n\n\"We have noted the PRC statement of regret, but the presence of this balloon in our airspace is a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law and is unacceptable that this has occurred,\" the official said.\n\nThe presence of the balloon prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken toindefinitely postponewhat was to be an already tense trip to China on Friday.\n\nThe visit was intended to reinforce communication and cooperation between the two countries as tensions have deepened over China's increasing military aggression toward Taiwan and closer alliances with Russian PresidentVladimir Putin.\n\nInstead, Blinken told China's director of Central Foreign Affairs Office, Wang Yi, in a phone call Friday that the balloon was an \"irresponsible act and a clear violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law that undermined the purpose of the trip,\" according to a readout of the discussion.\n\n—CNBC's Christina Wilkie and Amanda Macias contributed to this report\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has confirmed nothing, but it led to many reactions, including some that said if Trump were indeed arrested, it would lead to a surge in public support and a landslidevictory in 2024. But that’s a ridiculous assertion, and in reality, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nWhile information about Trump’s alleged forthcoming arrest is scarce, it would appear that such an action would be a gross overreach of power. However, while it seems a Trump indictment would undoubtedly be wrong and unjust, it would also be a mistake to say this would help him win the 2024 election. He would be the victim of a political stunt orchestrated by a radical, left-wing, Soros-funded district attorney. But that doesn’t help him get widespread support from people who previously didn’t vote for him.\n\nTHE DEFINITIVE ANTI-WOKE MARCH MADNESS BRACKET\n\nElon Musk is one person who made such a comment. Regarding a Trump indictment, Musktweeted, “If this happens, Trump will be re-elected in a landslide victory.” But nothing could be further from the truth — and I say this as someone who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. These kinds of predictions are similar to the people who said theFBI raiding Mar-a-Lago in August 2022would lead to a “red tsunami” in the midterm elections. And we know how that turned out.\n\nIf Trump is indeed arrested on bogus charges, sure, it will rile up his base and MAGA supporters throughout the country. However, as we saw in 2020, and to a lesser degree in 2016 because Trump won the Electoral College vote, that is not enough to win the popular vote in an election. Yes, we use the Electoral College, not the popular vote, in presidential elections. But victories without winning the popular vote are rare, and Trump already benefited from it once. It is extremely unlikely lightning would strike twice and it would happen again — especially to the same candidate.\n\nTrump getting arrested does not expand his appeal or widen his support to the point where millions of people who didn’t vote for him would suddenly do so. And, if anything, realistically, it would probably lead to a decrease in support. Other than the anger-induced fantasies of Trump’s supporters, nothing suggests this could legitimately happen.

Our Country can’t take this abuse anymore!”\n\nTrump received 74,222,958 votes in the 2020 election, while PresidentJoe Bidenwon with 81,283,098 votes. The election was not rigged. It’s unclear what “many others” the former president is referring to.\n\nAlthough Trump often claims he has been censored and silenced, the fact that his statement on the matter is nevertheless being widely read greatly weakens his argument.\n\nIn a follow-up statement, he added, “Next time I’m in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. It will be all business!”\n\nThe shutdown may be ending, but the story isn’t. A deal’s been struck, but serious questions remain.

Madihha Ahussain, a senior policy adviser for nonprofit anti-discrimination organization Muslim Advocates, said too much was at stake for Trump’s ban to be loosened.\n\n“Facebook’s decision to reinstateDonald Trump’s accounts just in time for the 2024 presidential election puts the public and our democracy in danger,” Ahussain said in an emailed statement. “Trump used Facebook to incite a deadly riot in the U.S. Capitol and spread outrageous conspiracies about the election that are still being used to undermine voting rights across the nation.

All of the GM plants on the chopping block make passenger cars.\n\nThe company will also discontinue the Chevrolet Cruze and Volt in North America as well as the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac XTS and Cadillac CT6.\n\nWhile sales of those models were suffering, they continued to support thousands of jobs. GM has about 1,500 employees at the Detroit plant, 1,600 at the Lordstown factory and 2,500 in Oshawa.\n\nAbout half of those workers will be given the chance to relocate to another GM operation, the company said.\n\nThe announcement comes ahead of next year's contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, which could potentially lead to decisions to devote vehicles to those facilities.\n\nThe union vowed to fight the plan, but there's a serious chance that the plants will close for good.\n\nCEO Mary Barra is seeking to reposition GM for a future defined by self-driving cars, ride-sharing networks and electric vehicles.\n\nThe cuts will make GM \"lean and agile\" as the company aims to \"lead in autonomous and lead in electric vehicles,\" Barra said.\n\nThe poilitical backlash against GM was swift and intense. President Donald Trump said he was \"very tough\" on Barra in a one-on-one conversation about the decision.\n\n\"This country has done a lot for General Motors,\" Trump said as he departed the White House for a series of campaign events in Mississippi. \"They better get back to Ohio and soon. So we have a lot of pressure on them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, fans of fuel-efficient vehicles were dismayed at the loss of several smaller cars and the semielectric Volt.\n\nThe automaker trumpeted the Volt for years as a symbol of its alternative propulsion expertise, but the company has since pivoted toward building fully battery-powered cars, such as the Chevy Bolt. The Volt, whose production model debuted about 10 years ago, still had a small gas engine paired with its battery pack.\n\nLike the Volt, the Cruze was also described for years as an illustration of GM's recovery after its federal bailout and bankruptcy. GM's decision to locate Cruze production in Ohio breathed new life into the Lordstown plant and was hailed by President Barack Obama's administration as reflective of the auto industry's revival.\n\nGM isn't getting rid of all of its passenger cars. It's keeping models such as the Chevy Malibu, Chevy Bolt, Cadillac CTS and Buick Regal.\n\nGM deserves credit for \"taking bold action\" but risks losing in the long run if consumers rediscover passenger cars, said Mike Ramsey, a transportation and mobility analyst for Gartner.\n\n\"There’s no guarantee that it’s going to stay SUV, SUV, SUV, SUV,\" Ramsey said. \"There may be a big return to sedans. So it could be problematic for them.\"\n\nTaken together, the moves will deliver more than $6 billion in additional annual cash flow by the end of 2020, GM said. That includes $4 billion in cost cuts and $1.5 billion in reduced capital expenditures.\n\nThe UAW said it would \"confront this decision by GM through every legal, contractual and collective bargaining avenue open to our membership.\"\n\nIt's a \"callous decision\" to cut American operations about 10 years after the automaker first accepted federal bailout money, UAW GM official Terry Dittes said in a statement.\n\n“GM’s production decisions, in light of employee concessions during the economic downturn and a taxpayer bailout from bankruptcy, puts profits before the working families of this country whose personal sacrifices stood with GM during those dark days,\" Dittes said. \"These decisions are a slap in the face to the memory and recall of that historical American made bailout.”\n\nGM said it would also close two additional plants outside of North America by the end of 2019. It will also continue with plans to close its plant in Gunsan, South Korea.\n\nThe workforce reduction will affect 15 percent of the company's salaried and salaried contract workforce. It's not clear how many of those cuts will be voluntary and how many will take the form of layoffs. GM offered buyouts to 18,000 workers several weeks ago.\n\nGM has 54,000 salaried workers in North America, meaning the company will cut about 8,000 of those positions, GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said.\n\nWhile Morrissey declined to specify how many workers agreed to take the buyout offer, he said, \"We did no..."}

But HR and workforce experts say that such a revolution of the U.S. work schedule might not happen any time soon—if at all.\n\nAccording to a survey run by Redfield & Wilton Strategies on behalf ofNewsweekamong a sample of 1,500 adults on March 7-8, 71 percent of Americans support the concept of a four-day workweek. Only 4 percent of respondents oppose it, while 22 percent neither support it nor oppose it. Three percent say they don't know how they feel about it.\n\nThese figures reflect the increased support that the concept of a four-day workweek has garnered in recent years, accelerated by the pandemic—a time when many people across the world started reconsidering their work-life balance.\n\nIn a push to rethink the way we work, many have questioned whether we should stick to the five-day workweek—introduced by theFordMotor Company in 1926 in the U.S. and later made into law byCongressin 1940—despite the fact that productivity has massively grown in the past century.\n\nWhile the concept of a four-day workweek first emerged in the 1970s, the idea of working fewer hours while keeping the same salary remained a far-fetched dream for most workers for decades. But now, after the pandemic, the rise of remote work, and the gig economy challenged the 9-to-5 workday, hundreds of companies around the U.S., Canada, Australia, United Arab Emirates, and Europe, among others, have turned this dream into a reality for their employees.\n\nStarting mostly from 2020, several companies around the world have tested the shorter workweek, with the U.K. holding the world's biggest trial. Since then, many of these companies—including several in the U.S.—have decided not to return to their old routine.\n\nBut can the four-day workweek grow from being an experiment to becoming the standard in the U.S.?\n\nIn the U.S. alone, with California leading the way,dozens of companieshave experimented with the four-day workweek in the past three years, closely monitoring its impact on workers' wellbeing, happiness, efficiency, and productivity. Most of them have decided to make it a permanent feature after receiving enthusiastic feedback from employees and seeing positive growth and productivity achievements.\n\nOne of these companies was Massachusetts-based Knowledge Futures Group, an independent non-profit created as a partnership between MIT Press and MIT Media Lab. The company ran a 32-hour workweek trial in July 2021, after workers reported feeling \"extremely fatigued and unproductive after over a year of working through the pandemic,\" a spokesperson for the group toldNewsweek.\n\nAt the heart of the company's decision to implement the four-day workweek was the idea of improving workers' productivity and happiness by taking away \"external stressors\"—the gnawing concern of when to find the time to tackle the outside-of-work obligations we all have in our lives.\n\nBy giving workers an extra day to take care of issues outside of work—like taking their kid or family member to the doctor, bringing the car to the mechanic—Knowledge Futures' workers were able to be more focused and productive while at work.\n\nThis feedback matches the expectations of most Americans surveyed byNewsweek: some 49 percent of respondents to the poll believe that a shorter workweek would make workers more productive, while 83 percent think they could complete their weekly workload in just four days.\n\nKnowledge Futures' experience with the four-day workweek has been brilliant overall, the company said. \"Employees pretty much unequivocally love the shorter week,\" a spokesperson for the company toldNewsweek.\n\n\"We've sent a series of surveys to employees since beginning the trial, and have seen durable increases in job satisfaction, work-life balance, connection to coworkers, and self-reported productivity. It's also been a boon to hiring. We've been basically overwhelmed by applicants for every job we've posted since advertising ourselves as a four-day workweek company, and the quality of hires we've made has been excellent.\"\n\nWhile Americans say they're ready to embrace the shorter workweek, the country's work environment might struggle to catch up with their desires. American work culture, with its focus on hard work, competitiveness, and accomplishments, could represent a major obstacle to the introduction of the four-day workweek at a nationwide level, according to experts.\n\n\"Americans love to work,\" Lindsey Cameron, an assistant professor of management at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, toldNewsweek.\n\n\"Work is the new religion here. And I mean religion in the way that work gives us our sense of meaning, our purpose, our friends, who we date—it's like the cornerstone of our life in the way that I think the Church used to be the cornerstone of people's lives maybe 150 years ago,\" she said.\n\nMatthew Bidwell, a prof..."}

John Fetterman,who unapologetically wears his trademark hoodies and shorts as does his duties. Fetterman often votes from doorways or sticks his head inside the chambers to avoid getting into trouble for his more casual wear.\n\n\"There has been an informal dress code that was enforced,\" Schumer said in a statement Monday, without mentioning Fetterman by name. \"Senators are able to choose what they wear on the Senate floor. I will continue to wear a suit.\"\n\nIn response, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine joked to reporters she planned to \"wear a bikini\" Tuesday. \"I think there is a certain dignity that we should be maintaining in the Senate, and to do away with the dress code, to me, debases the institution,\" Collins said.\n\nAlabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a former head football coach at Auburn University, said Monday it bothered him \"big time.\" He joked that he'd sport a \"coaching outfit\" during his next Senate floor appearance. \"You got people walking around in shorts, that don’t fly with me,\" Tuberville said.\n\nBut some etiquette experts said the lowering of the bar in terms of dress code in the Senate shouldn't be surprising given how much casual attire has taken hold in many U.S. workplaces, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and with more people working from home.\n\nRichard Thompson Ford, a Stanford University law professor in California and author of the book, \"Dress Codes: How the Laws of Fashion Made History,\" said the nation will have to see how the new Senate dress code plays out.\n\n\"It’s simply acknowledged that the norms of professional dress have changed,\" Ford said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nSome kind of dress code will likely always exist in public places, Ford said.\n\n\"People judge each other by their appearance and attire,\" Ford said. \"But written dress codes are certainly under attack. It might be a swing of a pendulum. But no doubt the trend is away from formal rules.\"\n\nFor his part, Fetterman,  the first-term senator who returned to work this spring followingtreatment for clinical depression, said inan interview on MSNBCMonday, \"Aren’t there more important things we should be talking about rather than if I dress like a slob?\"\n\nThat didn't stop Florida Gov. and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis from taking a shot at the Senate's dress code and Fetterman.\n\n\"I think it's disrespectful to the body,\" DeSantis told a reporter. \"And I think the fact that the Senate changed the rules to accommodate that I think speaks very poorly to how they consider that... Look, we need to be lifting up our standards in this country, not dumbing down our standards in this country.\"\n\nIn response to DeSantis's comments, Fetterman took to X, formerly Twitter, with a mocking response. \"I dress like he campaigns,\" Fetterman said.\n\nLate Tuesday, Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott and 45 of his GOP colleagueswrote a letter to Schumerexpressing \"our supreme disappointment and resolute disapproval of your recent decision to abandon the Senate’s longstanding dress code for members, and urge you to immediately reverse this misguided action.\"\n\nThe letter added that \"allowing casual clothing on the Senate floor disrespects the institution we serve and the American families we represent.\"\n\nThe episode shows how dress codes and politics have often shared a relationship dating back to the late Middle Ages, said Ford, the Stanford professor.\n\n\"At least from then forward, politics and clothing have always been linked,\" Ford told KGO-TV Monday. \"Clothing has been a mode of statecraft, it’s been a way to make a political statement, to make a statement about who you support, and who you oppose, that’s always been true, and I think it’s just as true today.\"\n\nFord told the TV station that Fetterman and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, known for wearing at times bright and bold sleeveless dresses, push some boundaries.\n\n\"Typically, we all decide by our reactions, to people we encounter, but more specifically, people who are in positions of power and authority,\" Ford said. \"When an elected official in Congress like Sinema and Fetterman says, ‘I don’t want to wear the conventional dress code,’ what they say carries some weight, and over time, they’re able to shift those expectations in a new direction.\"\n\nFord added that Fetterman and Sinema \"build a persona, kind of a personal brand if you will, in large part, rejecting some of the conventional norms of Washington and the Beltway, and that carries through their clothing, and for them, it’s a real asset, it’s a source of strength to resist the conventional dress code.\""}

Ron DeSantis when “conditions allow.”\n\nBiden declared a major disaster for the state and Gov. Ron DeSantis gave an update from the state Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee this morning.\n\n“You’re looking at a storm that’s changed the character of a significant part of our state, and this is going to require, not just the emergency response now, and the days or weeks ahead, I mean this is going to require years of effort, to be able to rebuild, to come back,” he said.\n\nIn the National Hurricane Center’s11 p.m. update, the system’s center was located 185 miles south of Charleston, S.C. moving north-northeast at 10 mph with 80 mph sustained winds and higher gusts. The system had dropped in strength to 65 mph at 5 a.m. but is regained hurricane status as it moves further out over open water in the Atlantic. The system as maintained its tropical-storm-force winds extending out 45 miles and is expected to make another landfall farther up the U.S. East Coast on Friday.\n\nIn the 8 p.m. advisory, the NHC said major-to-record river flooding will continue across Central Florida through next week.\n\nRain totals approaching 20 inches were forecast across parts of the peninsula prompting flash flood warnings across Central Florida while more than 2.6 million people were without power across the state at 1 p.m., according topoweroutage.us. Southwest Florida outages continue to be the hardest hit, but about 800,000 people were without power in Central Florida.\n\n“Lee and Charlotte are basically off the grid at this point,” DeSantis said noting power restoration will take time. “Charlotte and Lee reconnects are really going to likely have to be rebuilding of that infrastructure.”\n\nFlooding is widespread in Osceola County, and rescues are underway, said Andrew Sullivan, a spokesman for Osceola County Fire Rescue.\n\nAt a 55-and-up community in Kissimmee, first responders used an airboat to rescue people who were trapped in knee-to-waist deep floodwaters.\n\nThe airboat ferried two residents using a walker and their two dogs to dry ground. About 1,300 people live at Good Samaritan Society’s Kissimmee Village, which is vulnerable to flooding.\n\nIt’s unknown how many people didn’t evacuate, but deputies offered everyone a chance to leave, Sullivan said.\n\nAll the assisted-living residents who are the most vulnerable evacuated, he said.\n\nIan produced unprecedented flooding in Osceola County, Sullivan said.\n\n“It is widespread, and it is as levels we have not seen before in my time here and many other people’s time here,” he said.\n\nCounty officials are requesting state and federal assistance. The National Guard is staging at Silver Spurs Arena.\n\nTwo hospitals were forced to divert patients because of flooding, Sullivan said.\n\nA 38-year-old Lake County man who died when his car hydroplaned is listed as the first official fatality of Hurricane Ian, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has confirmed.\n\nThe FDLE had no further information, but a Florida Highway Patrol report said a man from Howey-In-The-Hills was driving east on County Road 48 12:30 p.m. Wednesday when he lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a pickup truck.\n\nAfter a death is confirmed to be hurricane-related, district medical examiners report the death to the Florida Medical Examiners Commission, which is staffed by the FDLE.\n\nVolusia County law enforcement reported an overnight death of a 72-year-old Deltona man who had gone outside during the storm to drain his pool.\n\n“Deputies responded to a home on Poinciana Lane near Lake Bethel around 1 a.m. after the victim’s wife reported he disappeared after heading outside.

However, many people prescribed Pfizer’s or Merck’s new medications will require careful monitoring by doctors and pharmacists, and the antivirals may not be safe for everyone, experts caution.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorizedPfizer’s Paxlovidfor mild to moderate Covid in people as young as 12 who have underlying conditions that raise the risk of hospitalization and death from the coronavirus, such as heart disease or diabetes. However, one of the two drugs in the antiviral cocktail could cause severe or life-threatening interactions with widely used medications, including statins, blood thinners and some antidepressants. And the FDA does not recommend Paxlovid for people with severe kidney or liver disease.\n\nFull coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nBecause of experts’ concerns about the potential side effects ofMerck’s molnupiravir, the FDA has restricted its use to adults and only in scenarios in which other authorized treatments, including monoclonal antibodies, are inaccessible or are not “clinically appropriate.”\n\nThe Paxlovid cocktail consists of two tablets of the antiviral nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir, a drug that has long been used as what is known as a boosting agent in HIV regimens. Ritonavir suppresses a key liver enzyme called CYP3A, which metabolizes many medications, including nirmatrelvir. In the case of Paxlovid treatment, ritonavir slows the body’s breakdown of the active antiviral and helps it remain at a therapeutic level for longer.\n\nThe boosting effect was likely to have been crucial in drivingPaxlovid’s high effectivenessin clinical trials.\n\nWhen Paxlovid is paired with other medications that are also metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme, the chief worry is that the ritonavir component may boost the co-administered drugs to toxic levels.\n\nComplicating matters, the drugs that pose interaction risks are widely prescribed to people at the greatest risk from Covid because of other health conditions.\n\nThe medications include, but are not limited to: blood thinners; anti-seizure medications; drugs for irregular heart rhythms, high blood pressure and high cholesterol; antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications; immunosuppressants; steroids (including inhalers); HIV treatments; and erectile dysfunction medications.\n\n“Some of these potential interactions are not trivial, and some pairings have to be avoided altogether,” said Peter Anderson, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. “Some are probably easily managed. But some we’re going to have to be very careful about.”\n\nIn itsfact sheet about Paxlovid, the FDA has published a detailed list of medications that may interact harmfully with ritonavir, including those that should not be paired with the Covid antivirals.\n\nHowever, pharmacists stress that many of the drug interactions are manageable and that they should not preclude most people from taking Paxlovid.\n\n“Pharmacists are highly trained experts in medication safety and monitoring and are an excellent source of information and advice about interactions between medications and also supplements and herbal products,” said Emily Zadvorny, a clinical pharmacist who is the executive director of the Colorado Pharmacists Society. “They will help determine if a significant interaction exists and devise solutions to mitigate the interaction if possible.”\n\nThe good news is that health care providers have experience navigating ritonavir’s use among people with HIV — a group that often takes medications for other health conditions, in addition to antiretroviral therapy.\n\nDr. William Werbel, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in transplant infectious diseases, advised people at high risk of Covid-19 complications to talk to their health care providers, as well as a savvy pharmacist, about changes they could make to their drug regimens should they need Paxlovid — even before they become infected with the virus.\n\nAnyone seeking Paxlovid, which must be prescribed within five days of the first symptoms, should be sure to let their prescribers and pharmacists know the complete lists of other medications and over-the-counter supplements they are taking, Anderson said.\n\nSome medications, such as particular statins, are most likely safe to stop taking during treatment with the Covid pills, Anderson said. For example, it might be better to stay on certain blood thinners but to lower the doses.

On the day Trump took office, it was$19.947 trillion, meaning under his administration, the debt has actually risen $2.065 trillion.\n\nPart of this is due to underlying trends in the growth of Medicare and Social Security costs, but the figure can also be attributed to the trillion-dollar deficit cost of the tax cuts Trump and congressional Republicans forced through in 2017, which predominantly benefited corporations and the wealthy.\n\nThe ballooning debt stands in stark contrast with Trump’s earlier campaign promises.\n\nAt his official campaign launchaddressin 2015, Trump told supporters he would apply his business acumen to federal fiscal policy, right from the get-go, saying he would “reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we’re in a bubble.”\n\n“Sadly, the American dream is dead,” he said at the time. “But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.”\n\nIn December that year, he alsosaidhe would “freeze the budget,” which has not happened.\n\nAgain, in March 2016, TrumptoldThe Washington Post that he could get rid of the debt “fairly quickly.” When pressed, he said, “Well, I would say over a period of eight years.”\n\nTrump also asserted during the second presidential debate in October 2016 that he would bring back energy companies, which would make so much money that they could pay off the national debt, which has not yet happened.\n\nShortly before his inauguration, hetoldSean Hannity that he would “balance the budget very quickly … I think over a five-year period. And I don’t know, maybe I could even surprise you.”\n\nHannity, whose show aired Tuesday night after the Treasury data was released, spent his time attacking Democrats over the wall, the Green New Deal, and the Senate Intelligence Committee’s work on the Russia investigation — and did not mention the federal debt at all.\n\nSince his election, Trump has suggested he would be able to start paying down the then-$21 trillion in debt “because of tariffs.” The ongoing trade-war that resulted from those tariffs has instead hit American farmers hard, with the agricultural industry unsure whether negotiations with countries like China — previously a major buyer of U.S. soybeans — will do much to reverse the damage.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, it will be much harder to reduce the now-$22 trillion debt now, considering he can’t reduce the deficit.\n\nIn fact, there does not appear to be any sort of Trump administration plan to reduce the debt — the last budget proposal it released was instead projected to add $7.2 trillion more to the debt over the next 10 years.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump regularly attacked President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for increasing the debt, alleging their past policies had added $9 trillion. Since taking office, Trump has quieted on the debt,tweetingabout it less than a handful oftimes, once in February 2017, and again in November 2017 and August 2018.\n\nTrump, who took office during a period of economic growth, has instead tried to take credit for the reduction in national debt he saw one month into his term, and attempted to adversely compare it to the increase in debt Obama saw in his first month. Obama took office as the Great Recession was accelerating, and the government was spending billions to shore up the financial sector.\n\nTrump’s firstjoint address to Congressand hissubsequenttwoState of the Union addresses also failed to mention the debt, the budgetary deficit, or anything related to fiscal policy. Last year, Trump’s budget director and current chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,dismissedhis boss’ budget promises as “hyperbole.”"}

At one point gasoline topped $5 a gallon. Supplies grew tight and prices rose globally after Russia invaded Ukraine and reduced energy supplies to Europe.\n\nThe year marked a dramatic turnaround from 2020 when travel ground to a halt during the coronavirus pandemic and demand for fuel evaporated. That year, the price for future oil contractsplummeted below zeroat one point, dozens of oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy protection and thousands of industry workerslost their jobs. Exxon, for the first time in decades,lost money in 2020.\n\nTwo years later, Exxon booked $12.75 billion in profits and $95.43 billion in revenue in just its final quarter.\n\n“While our results clearly benefited from a favorable market, the counter-cyclical investments we made before and during the pandemic provided the energy and products people needed as economies began recovering and supplies became tight,” said CEO Darren Woods. “We leaned in when others leaned out.”\n\nExxon achieved its best-ever annual refining output in North America and the highest globally since 2012, the company said. It completed the expansion of its Beaumont Refinery in Texas and expects to be able to process 250,000 barrels per day of crude oil there in first quarter of this year.\n\nMuch of the nation’s refining capacity taken offline during the pandemic has yet to return, Woods said during a conference call with investors, which drove refining margins higher.\n\n“We’ve continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from high-return, advantaged assets in Guyana and the Permian, at a time when the world needed it most,” Woods said.\n\nExxon earned $3.09 per share in the quarter. That was lower than the expectations of analysts polled by Factset, who were anticipating $3.29 per share.\n\nThe price of oil ranged between $70 to $90 for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude during the quarter. Domestic natural gas prices, which affect the cost of home energy and electricity, ranged from $6 to $7 per million British thermal units during the quarter, according to FactSet, which was a higher price than most Americans have paid in recent years.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, Russia’s decreased its supply of natural gas to Europe, which resulted in higher prices of natural gas and its liquid counterpart, LNG, on the global market.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has accused oil companies of profiting from the war Russia is waging on Ukraine, and has previously raised the possibility of awar profit taxon oil companies. Exxon said it incurred $1.3 billion during the quarter associated with European taxes on the energy sector and asset impairments.\n\n“A windfall tax on oil and gas profits is needed more than ever, to free up money that’s desperately needed to help those struggling with the cost of energy, and as economies around the world face recession,” said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner with Global Witness, a nonprofit organization that advocates for environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility.\n\nThe European Union imposed a windfall tax on energy companies last fall, and Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the tax in December.\n\n“We looked at what happened in the EU and said it both is not legal and it’s the opposite of what is needed,” Woods said Tuesday. “So what’s needed right now is more supply. And instead, what’s been put in place is a penalty on the broad energy sector.”\n\nExxon also announced progress on sustainability aims, saying it achieved its goal of eliminating routine flaring in the Permian Basin during the fourth quarter, which is part of its effort to reduce emissions. Flaring is a practice where oil and gas companies burn off excess natural gas instead of capturing it.\n\nExxon’s Low Carbon Solutions business recently signed a contract to capture and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, Woods said. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes carbon capture and storage, reinforces those plans and Exxon is planning to invest $17 billion in lower-emissions opportunities from 2022 through 2027, up from $15 billion in its prior plan, he said.\n\nExxon closed 2022 on a strong note, but softer oil and natural gas prices in the fourth quarter — compared to earlier in the year — had an impact, said Peter McNally, global sector lead at Third Bridge. “The big picture here for Exxon Mobil is that the company has financial flexibility and plenty of investment options,” McNally added.\n\nLearn how to navigate and strengthen trus..."}

The figures do not include migrants who evaded arrest.\n\nCritics blame the border crisis on Biden’s policies, including relaxing a Trump-era policy of quickly deporting border-crossers under a CDC COVID-19 rule and also ending a policy of requiring migrants to remain in Mexico to await a court ruling on their asylum claims.\n\nBiden said at a CNN town hall in October 2021, “I guess I should go down [to the border]. But the whole point of it is I haven’t had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down.”\n\nBiden sparked controversy by also saying at the CNN town hall that he had visited the US-Mexico border at some point in the past — despite there being no evidence of it.\n\nBiden said, “I’ve been there before and I haven’t — I mean, I know it well.”\n\nThe White House couldn’t provide an example of Biden visiting, however, andcould point only toa Washington Post fact check that said Biden “briefly drove past the border” after landing at El Paso’s airport in 2008 for an event in Mesilla, N.M. Biden’s motorcade took “a route that for a few minutes hugs the border of the United States and Mexico.”\n\nRepublican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida this year have bused or flown thousands of migrants from the US-Mexico border to Democratic bastions such as New York City and Washington, DC, in an attempt to pressure Biden to adopt stricter policies.\n\nAdvertisement"}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Elections Biden Democrats Seek Overhaul Presidential Primaries 2024", "output": "President Joe Biden has asked Democratic National Committee leaders to drastically reshape the 2024 presidential nominating calendar and make South Carolina the first state to host a primary, followed by Nevada and New Hampshire on the same day a week later, Georgia the following week and then Michigan, a source confirms to CNN.\n\nBiden’s preferences were announced Thursday evening at a dinner for members of the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee by committee co-chairs Jim Roosevelt, Jr. and Minyon Moore. The committee is set to meet Friday and Saturday in Washington and is poised to propose a new presidential nominating calendar.\n\nBiden’s expression of his preferences will play a significant role in the process. A DNC source said his elevation of South Carolina to the first-in-the-nation primary has sparked significant debate as members meet Thursday night. But with Biden’s support, this proposal is likely to ultimately gain the support of the committee, though this person emphasized that nothing is final until the votes are held.\n\nIf the DNC ultimately adopts this calendar, it would be an extraordinary shake up of the existing order and would strip Iowa of the first-in-the-nation status that it has held since 1972. Iowa has traditionally gone first, followed by New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. It would also add a fifth state to the slate before Super Tuesday (the first Tuesday in March) and elevate Georgia and Michigan as early nominating states for the first time.\n\nSouth Carolina’s primary would be held on February 6, Nevada and New Hampshire would have their contests on February 13, Georgia’s primary would be on February 20 and Michigan’s would be on February 27, according to the source.\n\nBiden had also sent a letter to DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee members on Thursday laying out what he believed should be guiding principles for the committee as it discusses the calendar.\n\n“Just like my Administration, the Democratic Party has worked hard to reflect the diversity of America - but our nominating process does not,” the president’s letter reads. “For fifty years, the first month of our presidential nominating process has been a treasured part of our democratic process, but it is time to update the process for the 21st century. I am committed to working with the DNC to get this done.”\n\nThe president wrote: “We must ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window. As I said in February 2020, you cannot be the Democratic nominee and win a general election unless you have overwhelming support from voters of color - and that includes Black, Brown and Asian American & Pacific Islander voters.\n\n“For decades, Black voters in particular have been the backbone of the Democratic Party but have been pushed to the back of the early primary process,” he continued. “We rely on these voters in elections but have not recognized their importance in our nominating calendar. It is time to stop taking these voters for granted, and time to give them a louder and earlier voice in the process.”\n\nBiden said in the letter the Democratic Party should abolish caucuses, arguing they are “inherently anti-participatory” and “restrictive.”\n\nThe Washington Postwas first to report on the president’s preferred order for the nominating calendar and the letter he sent to committee members.\n\nThe DNC earlier this year approved a plan to prioritize diverse battleground states that choose to hold primaries, not caucuses, as it considers which states should hold early contests. Beyond the tumult of the 2020 caucuses, Iowa is largely White, no longer considered a battleground state and is required by state law to hold caucuses.\n\n“There’s very little support for Iowa because they don’t fit into the framework and because of the debacle of 2020. There’s a lot of emotional momentum – it’s not unanimous – but there’s a lot of emotional momentum to replace Iowa with a state that is more representative, more inclusive and instills more confidence and is a battleground state,” one DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee member told CNN.\n\nAny new proposal by the committee would have to be approved at a full DNC meeting, which will take place early next year. If a new schedule is adopted, it would be the first changes made to the Democratic nominating calendar since 2006, when Nevada and South Carolina were added as early states. It would also break with the Republican calendar, as the Republican National Committee voted earlier this year to reaffirm the early state lineup of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, who has spearheaded Michigan’s effort to become an early-voting state, told CNN earlier on Thursday she was “feeling good” about Michigan’s chances and that she believed the state was in a “strong position” heading into the committee meeting.\n\n“The White House knows that we don’t win presidencies without the heartland,” Dingel..."}

Brian Kemp were not needed in downtown Atlanta Friday night as dozens of protesters held a peaceful demonstration following the release of bodycam video showingMemphis police officers brutally beating Tyre Nicholsfollowing a traffic stop.\n\nA small gathering of protesters met at Centennial Olympic Park, where they chanted and demanded justice for Nichols, who died of the injuries he sustained during the beating. The five Memphis officers involved were fired and have beencharged with murder and other crimes.\n\nThe Atlanta protesters held signs that read, \"Jail Killer Cops!\" and \"End Police Terror.\" They were accompanied by a heavy police presence surrounding City Hall and the Georgia State Capitol. Barricades had been set up to block the entrance,Fox 5 Atlanta reported.\n\nThe peaceful protest stood in contrast tolast weekend's violence, when six individuals were arrested on domestic terrorism charges after rioters threw rocks, launched fireworks and burned a police vehicle in front of the Atlanta Police Foundation building. The riot was instigated by anti-police activists opposed to the construction of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center – a $90 million police training facility for the Atlanta Police Department dubbed \"Cop City\" by its opponents.\n\nTYRE NICHOLS VIDEO: MEMPHIS AUTHORITIES RELEASE FOOTAGE FROM DEADLY TRAFFIC STOP\n\nA protestor holds a sign reading \"Justice for Tyre Nichols, Jail Killer Cops\" during a rally against the fatal police assault of Tyre Nichols, in Atlanta, on Jan. 27, 2023.(CHENEY ORR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nProtesters observe a moment of silence during rally against the fatal police assault of Tyre Nichols, in Atlanta, on Jan. 27, 2023.(CHENEY ORR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTYRE NICHOLS' MOTHER URGES PEACEFUL PROTEST: ‘I DON’T WANT US BURNING UP OUR CITIES'\n\nCity and state leaders warned that further violence would not be tolerated.

But the protests remained peaceful and the troops were not seen in the downtown area, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.\n\nOfficials condemned the actions shown in the videos released by theMemphis Police Departmenton Friday evening.\n\n\"Marty, the girls, and I were truly shaken and deeply saddened by the footage of events that led to Tyre Nichols' tragic death. We are praying for his family and community during this time of heartbreak,\" Kemp said in a statement. \"As citizens express their grief and reactions to his killing, the state continues to respect the right of peaceful protest.\"\n\nLAWYER OF EX-OFFICER CHARGED IN TYRE NICHOLS CASE RESPONDS TO VIDEO RELEASE\n\nProtesters hold signs during a rally against the fatal police assault of Tyre Nichols, in Atlanta, on Jan. 27, 2023.(CHENEY ORR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens called the video \"horrific\" and said he shared \"feelings of sickness and anger in the attack on Mr. Tyre Nichols.\"\n\n\"I am encouraged by the swift action taken by Memphis leaders to seek accountability from those responsible, and that these former officers have been charged,\" he said, adding that the Atlanta Police Department \"has taken great strides in recent years to fully implement vital policing reforms, and that work continues.\"\n\n\"To those who are called to lift up their voices and demonstrate: know that the City of Atlanta and our public safety agencies are prepared to support peaceful protest in our city. I am a firm proponent of full participation, community dialogue and peaceful demonstration. I ask for peace, and your partnership to not allow agitators to try to co-opt non-violent protest and put people in harm's way,\" the mayor said.\n\nSeveral protesters said they will return in greater numbers Saturday night, as more people see thevideo of Tyre Nichols' beating, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.\n\nOfficials hope the protests remain peaceful.\n\nChris Pandolfo is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.

We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what’s happening and why it matters.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism.Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTed Cruz tried to paint Beto O’Rourke as an “extreme” liberal in their final Senate debate. O’Rourke called him a liar.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and his Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O’Rourke just had what was likely to be their last face-to-face debate before the November 6 midterm elections.\n\nAs they sparred over Medicare-for-all, the GOP tax cuts, and border security, both candidates continued to try to appeal to their bases in a race that has captured national attention and money and built up long-held Democratic hopes of turning Texas blue.\n\nCruz argued that O’Rourke is dangerously liberal, while O’Rourke called Cruz out-of-step and beholden to Republican donors.\n\nCruz emphasized that O’Rourke is too “radical” for Texas — trying to paint him as more to the left than progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nO’Rourke, on the other hand, repeatedly called Cruz a liar and accused him of taking votes to please Republican donors rather than working for the people of Texas. He even adopted a nickname from President Trump: “Sen. Cruz is not going to be honest with you,” O’Rourke said at one point. “He’s dishonest, that’s why the president called him ‘lying Ted,’ and that’s why the nickname stuck, it’s true.”\n\nO’Rourke raised eye-popping $38 million in just three months, the most of any Senate candidate. There is undeniable hype surrounding his candidacy. But he is still the underdog in deep-red Texas. Even though some polling has shown the race in close single digits, Cruz has been in the lead in every single poll andis currently leading by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nO’Rourke still has another televised town hall with CNN that Cruz has said he won’t attend, so Tuesday night’s debate was the last chance for both candidates to be on stage and make their closing arguments together.\n\nHere are three key moments.\n\nThe sweeping GOP tax cuts became a moment of contention in the Texas Senate debate when Cruz was asked by moderator Jason Whitely to square his longtime stance to not increase the national deficit with voting for a GOP tax bill that is projected to increase the national deficit by more than $1 trillion.\n\nOver his career in the Senate, Cruz was a noted critic of government spending under the Obama administration, calling it “immoral” spending that would add to the national debt. But when it came for Republicans running deficits, Cruz went on the defense.\n\n“I’m proud to have supported the tax cut, the tax cut is producing enormous benefits for the state of Texas and for the country,” Cruz responded. Soon after, Whitely challenged Cruz by asking about the projection of the Congressional Budget Office, Joint Committee on Taxation, and other nonpartisan groups that the tax cut will in fact add $1.6 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.\n\n“No it wouldn’t — that projection is wrong,” Cruz said. “The reason we have deficit and debt is not because we cut taxes and grow the economy. We need to control the out-of-control spending by cutting things like socialized medicine.”\n\nO’Rourke used the opportunity to paint Cruz as corrupt, saying he voted for tax cuts and other Republican bills at the direction of donors and PACs — and highlighting his own pledge not to take PAC money.\n\n“Follow the money,” O’Rourke said. “Those tax cuts will disproportionately flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash in a country that is riven with income inequality unseen seen since the last Gilded Age.”\n\nO’Rourke is running as a progressive candidate in Texas, and Cruz seized on that. Cruz wanted voters who watched Tuesday’s debate to believe O’Rourke’s vision for America was one with socialized medicine bogged down by long wait times, extremely high costs for the government, and open borders that would lead to immigrants streaming into the US.\n\nCruz’s stance on immigration is largely focused on securing the border. He’s interested in expanding H1-B visas for skilled immigrants but railed against amnesty for immigrants who arrived in the US illegally. O’Rourke, on the other hand, wants to pass the DREAM Act and provide a path to citizenship for DREAMers, the young unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the US illegally as children.\n\nWhen it came to the immigration issue, Cruz played to fears about crime south of the border, saying O’Rourke opposed even the most basic border security.\n\n“Congressman O’Rourke not only opposes a wall ... he wants to tear down the ones we have,” Cruz said, noting the wall between O’Rourke’s hometown of El Paso, Texas, and neighboring Juarez, Mexico. “There’s a wall there, that wall is one of the tools you use to protect us.”\n\nO’Rourke shot ..."}

Almost a month ago theysubmittedan application to the FDA to get boosters approved for everyone 16 and over at least six months after their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSince then, the FDA has been evaluating the data the companies submitted. It reached a decision Wednesday evening.\n\nOn Friday, anoutside advisory committeeto the FDA decided there wasn't yet sufficient evidence to show COVID-19 booster shots for people under 65 are necessary.\n\nThat was \"relatively unusual\" said Phyllis Arthur, vice president of infectious diseases and diagnostics policy for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization.\n\n\"A lot of their conversation was around whether there was enough ability to parse the data out by population... to ensure the data was clear for multiple populations,\" she said.\n\nData from Israel suggests that COVID-19 vaccine protection begins to fade over time, beginning at around six months, with vaccinated people becoming first more prone to mild disease, and then to increasingly severe disease.\n\nCommittee members wanted to wait for more data to become available before issuing blanket approval for a booster shot for everyone 16 and older.\n\nInstead, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted to recommend a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine six months after full vaccination for people aged 65 and older and those at high risk of severe COVID-19.\n\nNow, the FDA has made its decision based on the data the companies submitted and the committee's recommendations.\n\n\"The committee advises FDA, they are not the decision-makers,\" said Dr. Kelly Moore, chief executive officer of Immunize.org, which educates health care professionals about U.S. vaccine recommendations.\n\nThe boosters can't be made available to the public until the CDC committee votes. The two agencies have different responsibilities.\n\nThe FDA decides if a drug or vaccine is safe and effective and whether it meets the claims made by the manufacturer. The CDC decides who should get that drug or vaccine.\n\nThe CDC's outside committee, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, met Wednesday and will meet again Thursday. It is expected to vote on who the boosters should be recommended for Thursday afternoon. That recommendation then goes to CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky for a signature.\n\nOnly when it's published by the CDC does it become official and health care workers can begin giving booster shots for this group."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Politics Motives And Implications Sen Kyrsten Sinemas Independent Turn", "output": "Tea leaves, Tarot cards, and crystal balls all agree: Arizona Sen.Kyrsten Sinema’sFriday re-registrationfrom Democratic to independentwill reverberate in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nSinema’s move could be an ominous one for the two-party-dominant system. Not since Ross Perot’s candidacies in 1992 and (to a lesser extent) 1996 has there been a greater potential for a non-Republican, non-Democratic candidate to contend seriously for the presidency. (And yes, Perot had a real chance to win in 1992 before hestarted behaving like a loon.) Especially with a doddering and incompetent Joe Biden apparently gearing up for a Democratic reelection bid and with Donald Trump likely to try torpedoing Republican chances if he is not that party’s nominee again, the public clamor for an alternative to both should be substantial.\n\nKYRSTEN SINEMA LEAVING DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO REGISTER AS INDEPENDENT\n\nGallup reports thatmore people now self-identify as independentsthan as either Republicans or Democrats. So far, those independents have lacked an electoral vehicle to effectuate their rejection of both parties. Increasingly, though, anyone with a decent political antenna can discern a growing restlessness among them to turn their independence into action.\n\nMeanwhile, anew partywhose most prominent member is the decidedly left-leaning but fresh-thinking entrepreneur Andrew Yang,the Forward Party, has worked hard to create at least a patina of cross-ideological unity. It includes former Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and strategistJoel Searby.\n\nMoreover, an unusual number of prominent politicians have expressed dissatisfaction with the two-party straitjacket and might conceivably choose an independent or alternative party route in future contests. Among them are not only the liberal Sinema (lifetime American Conservative Union rating just 14.74), the liberal-leaning Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia (ACU: 27.48), and the decidedly conservative Rep. Liz Cheney (ACU: 76.64), but also liberalex-Democratand former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (ACU just 7.61), centrist Republicans Rep. Adam Kinzinger (56.68) and former Rep. Will Hurd (64.40), restless Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, and Phil Scott of Vermont, and Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Except for those last three, they all are thought to harbor at least a modicum of presidential (or vice presidential) ambitions.\n\nFrom a Senate reelection standpoint for 2024, Sinema’s move to independent status makes little sense. Democrats are unlikely to give her a free ride bynotchoosing a strong nominee of their own, and Republicans will salivate over the center Left and the far Left dividing half the vote while the GOP nominee skates into office. Instead, unless Sinema plans to exit politics altogether, her move almost certainly indicates some presidential plans, either via the Forward Party or some other, non-major-party option. And while there’s almost no way for her to join a ticket with someone as conservative as, say, Cheney, one could see a combination of her with Hurd, Hogan, or Kinzinger.\n\nI’ve argued earlier that while a major third party would have a hard time actually breaking through to victory,a four- or five-party contestcould well create a winner who isn’t on either the Republican or Democratic tickets. And,just as was the case in 2015a month before Trump rode down the escalator topretendto care about people who felt voiceless, the public hunger remains for candidates less interested in toeing party lines than in showing they “care about people like me.”\n\nCount this column not as advocacy (it definitely isn’t), but as awell-consideredpredictionthat a third- (and perhaps fourth-) candidate effort will have a large part in determining the winner of the presidency in 2024. Sinema’s re-registration is the first step in that process.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNotifications"}

Payroll growth showed a sizeable gain from November's downwardly revised 173,000. October also was revised lower, to 105,000 from 150,000, indicating a slightly less robust picture for growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to increase 170,000 and the unemployment rate to nudge higher to 3.8%.\n\nA more encompassing unemployment measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged higher to 7.1%. That increase in the \"real\" unemployment rate came as the household survey, used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a decline in job holders of 683,000 as the ranks of those working multiple jobs increased by 222,000.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, or the share of the civilian working-age population either employed or looking for a job, slid to 62.5%, down 0.3 percentage point to its lowest since February and down 676,000 on a monthly basis.\n\nThe report, along with revisions to previous months' counts, brought 2023 job gains to 2.7 million, or a monthly average of 225,000, down from 4.8 million, or 399,000 a month, in 2022.\n\nMajor averages meandered through the day as markets reacted to a lower than expected reading from the ISM services gauge. The measure posted a lower than expected 50.6 reading, reflecting only narrow expansion, and the lowest level of the employment component since May 2020.\n\nTreasury yields were mostly higher, particularly in longer duration.\n\nThe December hiring boost as reflected in the Labor Department report came from a gain of 52,000 in government jobs and another 38,000 in health care-related fields such as ambulatory health-care services and hospitals. Leisure and hospitality contributed 40,000 to the total, while social assistance increased by 21,000 and construction added 17,000. Retail trade grew by 17,000 as the industry has been mostly flat since early 2022, the Labor Department said.\n\nOn the downside, transportation and warehousing saw a loss of 23,000.\n\nThe report showed that inflationary pressures, despite receding elsewhere, are still prevalent in the labor market. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% on the month and were up 4.1% from a year ago, both higher than the respective estimates for 0.3% and 3.9%. The average workweek edged lower to 34.3 hours.\n\nFed funds futures markets also reacted, lowering the odds of a March rate cut from the Federal Reserve to about 56%, according tothe CME Group.\n\n\"Today's report speaks to the bumpy road ahead for the Fed's journey back to 2% inflation,\" said Andrew Patterson, senior international economist at Vanguard. \"The decision of when to first cut policy rates remains one for the second half of the year in our view.\"\n\nFriday's data adds to the case that the U.S. economy continues to defy expectations for a slowdown, despite an inflation-fighting campaign from the Fed that has produced 11 interest rate hikes since March 2022 totaling 5.25 percentage points, the most aggressive monetary policy tightening in 40 years.\n\nAt their December meeting, Fed officials released projections that indicate they could enact three quarter-percentage point interest rate cuts this year. Markets, though, expect the central bank to be more aggressive, with futures traders pricing in up to six cuts.\n\nThe belief that the Fed can start cutting is fueled by the view that inflation will continue to recede after peaking at a 41-year high in mid-2022. Inflation is still above the Fed's 2% target but has been making steady progress lower since the increases began.\n\nHowever, Friday's report could challenge the market narrative of a substantially easier Fed.\n\n\"Jobs growth remains as resilient as ever, validating growing skepticism that the economy will be ready for policy rate cuts as early as March,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"Indeed, the recent run of labor market data generally points in one direction: strength.\"\n\nEconomic growth has held solid after consecutive negative-growth quarters to start 2022. Gross domestic product is on track to increase at a 2.5% annualized pace in the fourth quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed'sGDPNowreal-time tracker of economic data.\n\nConsumers have been resilient as well.

Activists chanted: \"Abort the court!\"\n\nRallies were held outside the homes of two other justices this weekend.\n\nOn Saturday night, a group of about 100 people marched from the home of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to Chief Justice John Roberts' house nearby in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n\nShut Down DC, the left-wing group behind Monday's demonstration outside Justice Alito's house, said the plan was to \"hold a moment of silence for the rights we know are ours\".\n\nSeparately, an anti-abortion centre suffered an arson attack on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, the US Senate unanimously passed a bill that would provide police protection to the immediate families of the nine Supreme Court justices and other officers of the court, if deemed necessary by the Marshals Service.

Abortion would still be legal in around half of US states, it is forecast.\n\nLawmakers in New York announced new legislation to expand abortion access on Monday. Several other left-leaning states have taken similar actions.\n\nNew York also said it plans to offer funding to groups that help people travel to the state for abortions.\n\nBoth pro- and anti-abortion protesters have rallied at the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington DC since the leak.\n\nIn scenes reminiscent of the unrest following the attack at the US Capitol last year, 8ft high fencing has been erected around the building.\n\nEven after the budget cleared Congress, it will still take days to reopen the government.\n\nOnce signed by President Donald Trump, the spending bill will reopen the government after 43 days.\n\nIn emails released by Democrats, Epstein says Trump \"knew about the girls\".

This is a war that should have never happened,\" Trump said, reiterating his belief that the Ukrainian president is in part at fault for Russia’s illegal 2022 invasion.\n\n\"I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval’,\" Trump said. \"I mean, he's got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap, because there'll be some land swapping going on.\"\n\nSUMMIT WITH PUTIN SET TO TOP TRUMP'S AGENDA THIS WEEK AS UKRAINE WAR TAKES CENTER STAGE\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the James S.

In fact, we’re standing together against this illegal aggression,” Biden said at a joint news conference Thursday night with Zelenskyy.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from the wealthiest democratic nations also reached a deal Thursday to give Ukraine a $50 billion loan this year backed by frozen Russian assets, signaling a determined commitment to beat back Russia’s invasion, U.S. officials said.\n\nAs Ukrainestruggles to preserveits independence amid Russia’s assault, the money will go toward military aid, humanitarian support and reconstruction of the country, a Biden administration official said at a news briefing.\n\nBiden said that taken together, the security agreement and the loan deal bolster Ukraine and send an unmistakable message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago.\n\n\"He cannot wait us out; he cannot divide us,\" Biden said. \"We're going to stand with Ukraine.\"\n\nThe security pact may not be as durable as Biden suggested. Its future most likely depends on the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who sought friendlier relations with Putin during his four-year term, could choose to pull out of the pact if he defeats Biden in November.\n\n\"What does [the security agreement] mean if you have a second Trump administration? Probably not much,\" retired Army Lt. Col.Alexander Vindman, who was director of European affairs in the Trump White House and is a frequent critic of the former president, said in an interview. \"But if there's a Democratic administration and we get past Trump and MAGA, there will be some consistency\" in America's support for Ukraine.\n\nBack home, Biden’s internationalist approach to foreign policy could be cast aside depending on the outcome of the election.\n\nAs president, Trump often sparred with allies in the Group of Seven nations — advanced industrial democracies including Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Canada and Italy — and if he returns, some of his former aides believe, he may pull the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, which has served as a bulwark against Russian aggression.\n\nZelenskyy said at the news conference that he viewed the new security pact as \"a bridge\" to joining NATO, the post-World War II military defense alliance. That won't happen right away. Biden has said Ukraine's membership in NATO wouldn't come while the war with Russia still rages.\n\nThe U.S. is prepared to commit the entire $50 billion if necessary, but it expects other nations will step forward and share the risk, the Biden administration official said. The loan will be secured by interest flowing from about $300 billion in frozen Russian assets.\n\n“How are we going to get repaid? Russia pays,” the official said.\n\nThe loan deal was officially announced Thursday during a G7 summit meeting.\n\n“There was a shared recognition by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nNegotiations on the effort have played out since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but political uncertainty may have given the talks renewed urgency. Biden faces a tough re-election campaign, and if he loses, this will be his last G7 meeting.\n\n“This summit is our best chance to act collectively, to close the gap by making Russia pay, not our taxpayers,” the Biden administration official said.\n\nWestern allies of Ukraine hope to keep Russia isolated through sanctions and diplomatic warnings to nations that might be inclined to assist Putin's forces.\n\nZelenskyy was asked at the news conference whether China has been aiding the Russian war effort. He replied that he had spoken to \"the leader of China by phone\" — a reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"He said that he will not sell any weapons to Russia,\" Zelenskyy said. \"If he is a respectable person, he will not — because he gave me the word.\"\n\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., told NBC News that he \"did not see any report on such a phone call.\"\n\nBiden’s stay in Italy is short: He arrived late Wednesday and will depart Friday night.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Leaked Pandora Papers Show Tax Havens Rich And Famous", "output": "Alleged lover and others linked to Putin have all come into extreme wealth. But is the money really theirs?\n\nIn September 2003, a secret transaction took place. The location wasMonaco, a tax haven associated with the international rich. Specifically, an exclusive block just beneath its lavish casino. An apartment changed hands. A local notary signed the deal. Purchase price: €3.6m (£3.1m). For this, the buyer got a luxury fourth-floor flat, two parking spaces, a storeroom, and the use of a pool in the Monte Carlo Star complex.\n\nFrom the balcony the new owner could gaze down on Monaco’s sparkling marina, stuffed during the summer with floating superyachts. Security ensured residents were undisturbed by tourists milling around a mini-garden built on the complex’s roof. There were sounds, too, pleasant ones – the clatter of helicopters ferrying new arrivals from Nice airport, and the screeching of swifts.\n\nThe identity of the flat’s buyer was a mystery. The official “purchaser” was an offshore company listed in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Brockville Development Ltd. Brockville was in turn owned by two further Panama-registered entities – Sefton Securities and, later, Radnor Investments SA. To outsiders, the arrangements looked a little like a Russian doll, with the ultimate beneficiary nestled under layers.\n\nThanks to documents in thePandora papers, the Guardian can identify the flat’s buyer – a woman, 28 years old in 2003, and at the time unknown. Name: Svetlana Krivonogikh. In the space of a few years, around the turn of the millennium, Krivonogikh became extremely wealthy. She acquired a flat in a prestigious compound in her home city of St Petersburg, properties in Moscow, a yacht, and other assets, worth an estimated $100m.\n\nHow to explain her fairytale rise? According to media reports, Krivonogikh’s background is modest. She grew up in a communal apartment, sharing a kitchen and bathroom with five families.\n\nKrivonogikh was a business student and worked as a cleaner in a store. Then, in the late 1990s, she appears to have acquired a benefactor:Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Pandora papers are the largest trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy in history. They provide a rare window into the hidden world of offshore finance, casting light on the financial secrets of some of the world’s richest people. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared access with the Guardian, BBC and other media outlets around the world. In total, the trove consists of 11.9m files leaked from a total of 14 offshore service providers, totalling 2.94 terabytes of information. That makes it larger in volume than both the Panama papers (2016) and Paradise papers (2017), two previous offshore leaks.\n\nWhere did the Pandora documents come from?\n\nThe ICIJ, a Washington DC-based journalism nonprofit, is not identifying the source of the leaked documents. In order to facilitate a global investigation, the ICIJ gave remote access to the documents to journalists in 117 countries, including reporters at the Washington Post, Le Monde, El País, Süddeutsche Zeitung, PBS Frontline and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In the UK, the investigation has been led by the Guardian and BBC Panorama.\n\nWhat is an offshore service provider?\n\nThe 14 offshore service providers in the leak provide corporate services to individuals or companies seeking to do business offshore. Their clients are typically seeking to discreetly set up companies or trusts in lightly regulated tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Panama, the Cook Islands and the US state of South Dakota. Companies registered offshore can be used to hold assets such as property, aircraft, yachts and investments in stocks and shares. By holding those assets in an offshore company, it is possible to hide from the rest of the world the identity of the person they actually belong to, or the “beneficial owner”.\n\nWhy do people move money offshore?\n\nUsually for reasons of tax, secrecy or regulation. Offshore jurisdictions tend to have no income or corporation taxes, which makes them potentially attractive to wealthy individuals and companies who don’t want to pay taxes in their home countries. Although morally questionable, this kind of tax avoidance can be legal. Offshore jurisdictions also tend to be highly secretive and publish little or no information about the companies or trusts incorporated there. This can make them useful to criminals, such as tax evaders or money launderers, who need to hide money from tax or law enforcement authorities. It is also true that people in corrupt or unstable countries may use offshore providers to put their assets beyond the reach of repressive governments or criminal adversaries who may try to seize them, or to seek to circumvent hard currency restrictions. Others may go offshore for reasons of inheritance or estate planning.\n\nHas everyone named in the Pandora papers done someth..."}

Their armored groups have struggled against Western-supplied anti-tank weapons and Turkish-made drones. Ukrainian air defenses have punched above their weight and are now being reinforced by thousands of US-made Stinger missiles.\n\nPoor logistical support, questionable tactics and growing evidence of poor morale among Russian battalion tactical groups have allowed the Ukrainian military to hold off Russian advances in several regions – and begin to take the fight to the enemy.\n\nCNN analysis of satellite imagery, social media content and official statements from both sides suggests the conflict may now be moving into a new phase: a war of attrition in which the Russians may lose more ground than they gain and suffer even greater resupply issues as the Ukrainians cut into their extended lines.\n\nThere are indications that the Russian military is trying to compensate for this by greater use of missile forces and indirect fire from artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. To the north and west of Kyiv, for example, the Russians appear to be digging in rather than seeking to advance, shelling areas like Irpin and Makariv, where Ukrainian troops have established a tenuous hold.\n\nIn the last two weeks, there’s been an uptick in Russian missile strikes,from Lvivin the west to Zhytomyr in central Ukraine and Mykolaiv in the south, with prime targets being fuel dumps, military depots and airfields.\n\nThe Ukrainians have been mostly circumspect about going on the offensive, but on Friday National Security Adviser Oleksiy Danilov said: “We are going on the counterattack in some areas, and this counterattack is absolutely productive.”\n\nThese fightbacks are limited and focused but include fronts in the south, central Ukraine and the northeast.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, in its latest assessment, describes them as “prudent and effective, allowing Ukrainian forces to regain small areas of tactically or operationally significant terrain without overextending themselves.”\n\nThe push towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson is perhaps the most ambitious. After resisting attempts by Russian forces to take Mykolaiv – a bridgehead for assaulting Odesa – the Ukrainians launched devastating missile attacks against the Russian command at Kherson’s airport (killing a Russian general in the process, they say) and gained ground to the north of the city. This as civil disobedience in the city has frayed the nerves of Russian troops.\n\nOn Sunday, a large crowd took to the streets of Kakhovka – east of Kherson – to protest Russian occupation. A local journalist, Oleh Baturin, told CNN that Russian forces still controlled the area. Kakhovka matters because it’s close to a bridge linking Kherson with points east. A Russian land corridor linking Crimea with its border would be hard to sustain without that access.\n\nBaturin said there was heavy fighting near the nearby town of Tavriysk and Nova Kakhovka, where there was a large concentration of Russian forces.\n\nHow this battle evolves could have a major bearing on the Russian campaign in the south.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Ukrainian units have also gained territory close to the Russian border, around the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Kharkiv, just 30 miles from the Russian border, has been under almost constant attack since the first day of the invasion but remains in Ukrainian hands.\n\nUkrainian forces now appear to have retaken some outlying areas. Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, claimed Saturday that “several settlements were liberated” east of the city.\n\nA long video analyzed by CNN showed an assault by troops of the ultra-nationalist Azov Battalion on a village near Kharkiv in which they took a number of Russian prisoners, some of them apparently badly wounded. Other videos showed a string of villages south of Kharkiv now in Ukrainian hands.\n\nRussian forces continue a weeks-long attempt to take Izium, to the south of Kharkiv, but Ukrainian resistance continues in the heavily damaged city.\n\nRelated articleA beekeeper, a builder and a homeless man: The civilian victims of Putin's invasion\n\nA local official, Maksym Strelnyk, said Sunday that “currently, the situation in Izium is extremely complicated. Fierce fighting continues.”\n\nStill in the northeast, CNN has geo-located video and images showing Ukrainian forces back in control of the town of Trostyanets, some 30 miles from the city of Sumy, with Russian armor including a T-80 tank and infantry fighting vehiclesdamaged and abandoned.\n\nThe Ukrainian 93rd Brigade posted images on its Facebook account showing its soldiers in Trostyanets, and said the Russians had fled..."}

The bogus story got ample coverage on Fox News, as well.\n\nButaccording toa fact-check inUSA Today, the real story was much more benign:\n\nThe post mischaracterizes two incidents involving migrants who approached school buses at stops on their routes. There were no hijackings attempted, and authorities said no crimes were committed and no one forcefully attempted to stop or enter the vehicles.\n\nA spokesperson for the East County Sheriff's officetold The San Diego Union-Tribunethe incident may have been a simple misunderstanding.\n\n“Sheriff’s deputies determined that no one forcefully tried to stop or enter the school buses, therefore no crime was committed,”sheriff’s spokesperson Kimberly King said Thursday. “It is not uncommon for community volunteers and charitable organizations to provide resources in these parts of the county, some of which operate vehicles similar to school buses.”\n\nAuthorities said several of the people involved were taken into custody without incident and were being processed for removal proceedings. So, not only was there no crime committed, but the immigration process appears to be working as designed in this case. Certainly not the fearsome scenario suggested on social media.\n\nA similar hysteria also erupted among conservatives online — including Musk, Fox News andDonald Trump— over an incident in Aurora, Colorado, in late August. Those posts showed video footage of armed men at an apartment complex along with claims that it had been taken over by Venezuelan gangs. Trump went as far as baselessly claiming Venezuelans had taken over “parts of the city.”\n\nBut the story being pushed by Republicans isn’t backed up by evidence, according to the interim police chief in Aurora, Heather Morris.\n\nOn Friday,she said:\n\n“We’ve been talking to the residents here and learning from them to find out what exactly is going on.

Biden and other leaders from some of the world’s largest economies stood on a green lawn while people in military uniforms parachuted in carrying oversized flags of the different countries.\n\nSeveral cameras, including one from NBC News, were present to document the meeting, where Bidenwas expected to pushfor more support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\nBut the cameras captured slightly different angles, and Biden’s critics seized on one of them to push their allegation that Biden, 81, is absent-minded and too old to be president.\n\nThe video isone of manythat have circulated widely online in recent weeks attempting to cast relatively normal moments as gaffes or evidence that Biden is suffering from a mental decline. Experts have warned that while advanced technology like generative artificial intelligence can spread misinformation, so-calledcheapfakesthat often use only minor or selective editing can be more effective at spreading false narratives.\n\nThe NBC News video contains nothing to suggest that Biden wandered, a word that often implies aimless walking. Instead, it shows he was walking toward a specific destination: a group of at least three kneeling parachutists.\n\nMany of the deceptive videos went viral on X, which under owner Elon Musk has transformed into an increasingly influential media outlet in conservative circles — one that’s hostile to the Biden administration and where false stories spread with few checks by the platform.\n\nThe New York Post, controlled by the conservative Murdoch family, posted a video Thursday that appeared to be taken with a phone in the vertical position, meaning that it showed little of what was happening on either side of Biden. The video shows Biden walking about seven steps away from the other leaders, seemingly with no destination, and giving at least one thumb-up to whatever was off-camera. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni follows him, touches his arm and directs Biden’s attention in the opposite direction.\n\nThe New York Post, in text superimposed on the video, said that Biden “appears to wander off” and “has to be pulled back.” Its post on Xgot 4.2 million videos, according to X’s tally Friday.\n\nAndrew Bates, the White House senior deputy press secretary, criticized the Post’s reporting.\n\n“The Murdoch outlets are so desperate to distract from @POTUS’s record that they just lie,” hewrote on X.\n\n“Here, they use an artificially narrow frame to hide from viewers that he just saw a skydiving demonstration,” he wrote. “He’s saying congratulations to one of the divers and giving a thumbs up.” His post received 2.4 million views.\n\nA spokesperson for the Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nBut the claims continued from conservative and Republican accounts, which used the same video or other camera angles with limited context. A post from a Republican National Committee used a video that, although it had a wider angle, still did not show what Biden was walking toward. It received 2.9 million views on X.\n\n“WHAT IS BIDEN DOING?”the RNC postasked. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nA post on X from Clay Travis, a conservative talk radio host, used the same video as the RNC. He wrote that Biden “just goes wandering off” and that other national leaders “are babysitting our president in Italy.” His postreceived 1.1 million views. In a follow-uppostFriday, Travis said he stood by his view that Biden is not mentally fit to be president.\n\nThe RNC's and Travis' posts did not have community notes on them Friday, though X users had proposed some and were in the process of voting.\n\nThe NBC News video angle clearly includes what the others did not: the group of kneeling parachutists who were only steps away from Biden. As they’re kneeling, Biden walks toward them, stops and gives them two thumbs-up. At least one of them appears to acknowledge Biden by standing at attention.\n\nMeloni does pull Biden back to the group as someone appears to begin speaking, but there’s no indication in the NBC News video that Biden was unaware of his surroundings.\n\nDeceptive videos of Biden have become a common tactic during the 2024 presidential campaign, which features Biden and 78-year-old former President Donald Trump.

The troops were deployed there to help bolster NATO’s eastern flank amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe training is another way in which the US has aided the Ukrainian military while attempting to not directly engage Russian forces, which would potentially touch off a wider war.\n\nBiden had heard from the troops while he was in Poland about how they were providing the tactical weapons training to the Ukrainians there, the sources said.\n\n“We were talking about helping train the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland,” Biden said on Monday. He was seeking to clarify a remark he made last week to US troops that they would be seeing “when you’re there … women, young people, standing in the middle of the damn tank, saying, ‘I’m not leaving. I’m holding my ground.’”\n\nA White House official told CNN, “There are Ukrainian soldiers in Poland interacting on a regular basis with US troops, and that’s what the President was referring to.”\n\nThe sources told CNN that while US troops are indeed providing some instruction to the Ukrainians at a military base in Poland, it does not amount to “formalized” training.\n\nRather, the coaching is more tactical and in-the-moment, the sources explained. That includes showing the Ukrainian soldiers picking up the weapons shipments in Poland how to use some of that equipment, like the Javelin anti-tank missiles that the West has been sending in large numbers. Poland has become the central transit point of arms transfers into Ukraine.\n\nThe US has allocated $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine in the last month alone, and intends to provide Ukraine’s armed forces with more than 9,000 shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, including Javelins; nearly 7,000 small arms including machine guns and grenade launchers; 20 million rounds of ammunition; and 100 armed drones.\n\n“These are direct transfers of equipment from our Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them as they fight against this invasion,” Biden said earlier this month. “We’re going to continue to do more in the days and weeks ahead.”\n\nNATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod D. Wolters told US lawmakers on Tuesday that the US had been providing “advice and assistance with respect to materiel” going into Ukraine, but that the US forces are not “in the process of currently training military forces from Ukraine in Poland.”\n\n“There are liaisons that are there that are being given advice, and that is different than what I think you are referring to with respect to training,” Wolters told Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas when asked about the training.\n\nWolters said separately during the hearing that “as you well know we’ve made dramatic improvements in our information sharing and intelligence sharing, and as [the Ukrainians] continue to pursue their campaign, our advice and our assistance with respect to material will be very, very important,” Wolters said.\n\nWhile the US and NATO have so far ruled out sending any troops into Ukraine, on top of the tactical military training there has been robust intelligence sharing going on between the US and Ukrainian forces, CNN has previously reported.\n\nIn most cases, two sources familiar with the sharing system said, the intelligence being shared involves information about Russian force movements and locations, as well as intercepted communications about their military plans.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Please see our Privacy Policy for more information.\n\nEven for someone who’s shunned the public eye and spoken solely through indictments for the past year and a half,Robert Muellerhas been uncharacteristically quiet in recent weeks. This is, of course, by design—Justice Department guidelines stipulate that prosecutors should avoid taking any major steps close to elections. And unlike former F.B.I. directorJames Comey,those who’ve worked with Mueller expected him to hew closely to D.O.J. protocol. “The one thing I am confident of is that he is going to make sure that he doesn’t do anything on the timing front that would interfere with the midterm elections,”Glenn Kirschner,a former homicide prosecutor who reported to Mueller in the 1990s,told melast month. “It wouldn’t surprise me if the indictment went completely radio silent between now and the midterms.”\n\nThough it was preordained, Mueller’s silence has nevertheless raised expectations as to what he might deliver once ballots are cast. Citing two U.S. officials, Bloombergreportedearly Wednesday that he is expected to issue reports on two critical aspects of the D.O.J. investigation into Russian interference shortly after midterm elections. Specifically, Mueller is expected to release his findings on whetherDonald Trumpobstructed justice, and if there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, according to one official that spoke with the outlet. (Trump and his campaign have denied any wrongdoing.)\n\nThis timeline raises several questions about the future of the Russia investigation. For one thing, it’s unclear whether such a report would mark the end of the inquiry. Per Bloomberg, Mueller is under pressure from Deputy Attorney GeneralRod Rosensteinto wrap up his investigation as “expeditiously as possible.” But if a blue wave sweeps Democrats to a majority in the House, the political calculus for Rosenstein could change. The No. 2 Justice Department official, who took over the Russia probe after Attorney GeneralJeff Sessionsrecused himself last year, has come under frequent attacks from Trump and the president’s allies in the House. But such pressure would likely dissipate if Democrats won back the chamber.\n\nOf course, how long Rosenstein will remain in control of the probe is also an open question. For weeks, reports have circulated that Trump is likely to fire Sessions after the midterms—rumors the president has madelittle effortto tamp down. Republican senators—who were once largely united in their defense of their former colleague from Alabama—have seemingly resigned themselves to the attorney general’s ouster. If Trump appoints someone to replace Sessions who manages to survive a Senate confirmation, that person could then take over from Rosenstein.\n\nRosenstein’s fate, too, is unknown. AfterThe New York Timesreportedlast month that Rosenstein suggested officials secretly record Trump and discussed a plan to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office, the deputy attorney general reportedly offered to resign from his post. Trump latersaidhe would prefer if Rosenstein remained in his post, and the two have since appeared tomend ties. But speculation remains that Trump may fire Rosenstein after the midterms as well.\n\nWhat is clear is that one of the most consequential chapters in the Mueller investigation will follow the midterm elections. Between now and November 6, Kirschner told me, the special counsel could issue “satellite indictments” for fringe players in the Russia saga, such as former Trump adviser and longtime Republican operativeRoger Stone,but any bombshells will have to wait. By then, Trump could have very little to lose. With midterms in the rearview mirror, the stakes for both the president and the Republican Party could change dramatically. Trump, his businesses, and his administration are all but guaranteed to face heightened scrutiny if Democrats win back the House, but the G.O.P. is predicted to hold on to its majority in the Senate, meaning impeachment will likely remain a liberal pipe dream. Trump, meanwhile, will have newfound latitude to curtail the Russia investigation—without the fear of repercussions at the ballot box.\n\nMore from Vanity Fair\n\nContact\n\n©2025Condé Nast.

For many of us, that means time off work, picnics and pool parties, and maybe watching a football game.\n\nBut when Labor Day began in the late 19th century, it was intended to honor the hard work and sacrifices of the US trade union movement. Over the decades, a lot of that has gotten lost along the way.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Labor Day, including its history, traditions and the dates for Labor Day for the rest of the decade.\n\nPeter J. McGuire\n\nThere are competing theories about the origins of Labor Day. According to the US Department of Labor,Peter J. McGuire, creator of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and, with Samuel Gompers, co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, is often credited with proposing a holiday honoring the working man at a gathering of the New York Central Labor Union on May 12, 1882.\n\nHeld in September, the celebration would include a street parade and picnic that \"would publicly show the strength and esprit de corps of the trade and labor organizations,\" according to the proposal.As industrialization had swept through the 19th century, many workers protested against lost wages, long hours and dangerous working conditions. Management would oftensend in Pinkerton guardsto respond with threats and violence.\n\nMcGuire's work in the trade union movement -- and especially in major labor strikes in 1886 and 1890 -- helped lead to widespread acceptance of the eight-hour workday in the US.But, as the Labor Department also notes, some sources say a different turn-of-the-century labor activist, Matthew Maguire, was the real \"father\" of Labor Day.\n\nMaguire was considered a radical in his time, even by Gompers. A machinist in New Jersey, he ran for vice president on the Socialist Party ticket in 1896. In 1882, when McGuire supposedly proposed his holiday, Maguire was secretary of the Central Labor Union.\n\nIn The First Labor Day Parade,historian Ted Watts suggests Maguire's socialist politics were considered too extreme to make him the face of this new holiday, so McGuire was given the honor.\n\nStill, when the Central Labor Union held the first Labor Day Parade in New York City on Sept. 5, 1882 -- a Tuesday, not a Monday -- Maguire was the one who sent out the invitations and rode at the front of the procession.\n\nIn 1894, an editorial in the Paterson, New Jersey, Morning Callclaimed Matthew Maguirewas \"the undisputed author of Labor Day as a holiday.\"\n\nLabor Day was first recognized as a state holiday by Oregon in 1887 and, over the next few years, more than two dozen more states followed suit.In 1894, Congress passed a bill designating Labor Day a federal holiday to be held on the first Monday in September. President Grover Cleveland signed the legislation into law on June 28 of that year.\n\nA Labor Day parade in Okeechobee, Florida.\n\nLabor Day falls on the first Monday of September. This year it's on Sept. 5.Here are the dates for Labor Day through 2030.\n\nCanada also celebrates Labour Day on the first Monday in September. Dozens of other countries around the world honor the labor movement on May 1, known asInternational Workers' Day.\n\nThe date was chosen in 1889 by the Second International, a collection of socialists, communists and labor organizers, because it was the third anniversary of theHaymarket Affair, a seminal incident in the US labor movement.\n\non May 1, 1886, the AFL called on American workers to go on strike for an eight-hour workday and many did. In Chicago, a multiday demonstration turned bloody when police attacked workers near the McCormick Reaper plant.\n\nPolice and protestors at Haymarket Square in Chicago on May 4, 1886.\n\nThe violence escalated on May 4, when an unknown assailant threw a bomb into the crowd. The blast and ensuing gunfire killed seven police officers and at least four civilians, wounding dozens more.\n\nWhile the incident happened in the US, and had a profound impact on the international labor movement, there was a desire to keep \"the principle of working-class unity or trade union unity\" from overshadowing nationalism and patriotism, historian Peter Linebaughtold NPR.The US doesn't officially recognize May 1 as International Workers' Day.\n\nLighter-colored fabrics reflect the sun, making them well suited for the hot summer months.

The military said that fewer than 10 of the casualties were a result of Israeli fire and released new details Thursday night claiming that soldiers had fired warning shots and attempted to ease the crush of people looting a convoy of aid trucks that entered northern Gaza early Thursday morning.\n\nThe violence was quickly condemned by Arab countries. US President Joe Biden held talks on the incident with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, as well as on ways to secure the release of 130 hostages held by Hamas since October 7 and a six-week ceasefire in the war.\n\nBoth the White House and State Department expressed horror over what occurred and indicated that they would demand answers from Israel.\n\n“This latest event needs to be thoroughly investigated,” White House spokesperson Olivia Dalton told reporters on Air Force One. “This event underscores the need for… expanded humanitarian aid to make its way into Gaza.”\n\nThe IDF published a drone video showing thousands of people swarming around the aid trucks as they reached the area in northern Gaza. In some cases, the vehicles continued to try and push past the crowds.\n\nThe military acknowledged that troops opened fire on several Gazans who moved toward soldiers and a tank at an IDF checkpoint, endangering soldiers, after they had rushed the last truck in the convoy further south.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller offered condolences for those killed and said that Washington had asked Israel to provide answers and ensure safe aid delivery.\n\n“We have been in touch with the Israeli government since early this morning and understand that an investigation is underway. We will be monitoring that investigation closely and pressing for answers,” he said, calling on Israel to allow “as many points of access as possible, and to enable safe and secure distribution of that aid throughout Gaza.”\n\nThe IDF has coordinated several aid deliveries to northern Gaza in recent weeks, although this one was larger than usual. It said it would now look for a solution to prevent such incidents from happening again and was conducting probes into the incident.\n\nThe US spokesman said the rush for aid showed the situation was “incredibly desperate” in Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of the risk of famine. “People are swarming these trucks because they’re hungry, because they need food, because they need medicine and other assistance,” he said.\n\nSpeaking in English in a Thursday evening press conference, IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that troops had fired warning shots in an attempt to disperse the mob of Palestinians.\n\n“This morning, the IDF coordinated a convoy of 38 trucks to provide additional humanitarian assistance to the residents of northern Gaza. This humanitarian aid came from Egypt, went through a security screening at the Kerem Shalom humanitarian crossing in Israel, and then entered Gaza, for distribution by private contractors,” Hagari said.\n\n“As these vital humanitarian supplies made their way toward Gazans in need, thousands of Gazans [rushed] the trucks, some began violently pushing and trampling other Gazans to death, looting the humanitarian supplies.”\n\n“Here are the facts: At 4:40 a.m., the first aid truck in the humanitarian convoy started making its way through the humanitarian corridor that we were securing,” Hagari continued. “Our tanks were there to secure the humanitarian corridor for the aid convoy. Our UAVs were there in the air to give our forces a clear picture from above.”\n\n“At 4:45 a.m., a mob ambushed the aid trucks, bringing the convoy to a halt,” he said, showing a new video of the incident.\n\n“In this video, the tanks that were there to secure the convoy saw the Gazans being trampled and cautiously tried to disperse the mob with a few warning shots,” he said. “When the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand, the tank commander decided to retreat to avoid harm to the thousands of Gazans that were there.”\n\n“You can see how cautious they were when they were backing up. They were backing up securely, risking their own lives, not shooting at the mob,” he continued, insisting that the army “operates according to the rules of engagement and international law.”\n\n“No IDF strike was conducted toward the aid convoy,” Hagari said. “On the contrary, the IDF was there carrying out a humanitarian aid operation, to secure the humanitarian corridor, and allow the aid convoy to reach its distribution point, so that the humanitarian aid could reach Gazan civilians in ..."}

All rights reserved.FAQ-New Privacy Policy\n\nFormer Trump economic adviser Steve Moore provides insight into the latest jobs report.\n\nLabor Day is traditionally an opportunity to recognize the contributions made by workers, but this year it's small businesses that are celebrating. That's because this Labor Day coincides with the end of enhanced federal unemployment benefits that were paying people not to work. These payouts have contributed to a recordlabor shortagethat prevents small businesses from bringing the economy back. Oxford Economics estimates that roughly 11.2 million Americans will lose some form of federal unemployment benefits this week. This will help fill the 10.1 million available jobs nationwide.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department released its August jobs report, showing that only 235,000 jobs were created in the month -- a huge miss from economists' expectations of around 750,000. There are still5.3 million fewer peopleworking than before the pandemic. On Thursday, the Labor Department announced its weeklyjobless claimsnumbers, which suggest that overly generous unemployment benefits are to blame for this labor market slack. They show that about60 percentmore Americans filed continued unemployment claims in late August than in early 2020.\n\nMichael Lee Strategy founder Michael Lee argues that the ‘dismal’ jobs report is a poor reflection on the White House\n\nEnhanced federal unemployment insurance paid recipients $300 per week in addition to weekly state unemployment payments, which averagenearly $400. That means that Americans could make nearly $3,000 a month tax-free in unemployment benefits, not including the value of other welfare programs such as monthly child credits and food stamps, for sitting on the couch. No wonder thelabor markethasn't bounced back.\n\nAccording to a Committee to Unleash Prosperityreport, the average unemployment benefit for a household with twounemployed parentswas more than $72,000 -- higher than the nation's median income. Research from JPMorgan Chaseestimatesthat 48 percent of benefit recipients made as much or more than their previous wages.\n\nEXTRA UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ENDING SOON, LEAVING MILLIONS WITHOUT AN INCOME\n\nTwenty-five Republican statesrecognizedthe perverse incentive posed by these benefits and ended them in the spring and early summer. Nine out of the tenlowest unemployment statesin the country are among this group that terminated enhanced payments early. In contrast, all ten highest unemployment states, including Washington D.C., continued to accept them until recently.\n\nGoldman Sachs economistsfound\"clear evidence that benefit expiration increased the rate at which unemployed workers became employed.\" They predict that the end of the payouts will create 1.5 million jobs nationwide by the end of the year. Research from the Foundation for Government Accountabilityfindsthat job creation in Arkansas nearly doubled in the two weeks after payments ended.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe most compelling evidence of the negative impact of enhanced insurance comes from small businesses themselves. Jim Balis, the CEO of Sizzling Platter, which operates about 500 restaurants nationwide,toldthe Wall Street Journal that applications rose by roughly 20 percent in non-benefit states. \"We saw a material difference in the states that pulled benefits back.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin Thomas, general manager of McSeagull's in Boothbay, Maine, was forced toclosehis restaurant and let his 36-person workforce go this summer due to the labor shortage. \"It really comes down to how much money will you make going to work versus how much you will make sitting at home doing nothing?\" he said. \"If that money is too close to each other people will want to sit home.\"\n\nFor small businesses, the battle against bad government policies never ends.

This is quite terrifying, especially since Trump has already shown his desire to spread false or incomplete information about this public health crisis,” the woman wrote.\n\nShe had tracked down Fauci’s email, which is not easily accessible on government websites, because she had a pressing question: “I’m planning to fly domestically TOMORROW [REDACTED]. Is it safe??”\n\nOf course, Fauci had urgent matters of his own to attend to, but he replied to the stranger anyway the next day. “There is much misinformation,” he wrote back. “I actually have not been muzzled at all by the Vice President. And BTW, it is safe to fly domestically [REDACTED].”\n\nMore than 3,200 pages of emailsobtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed News — covering the period from January to June 2020 — provide a rare glimpse into how Fauci approached his job during the biggest health crisis of the last century, showing him dealing directly with the public, health officials, reporters, and even celebrities. (The Washington Post also received more than 800 pages of emails andpublished a storyabout them on Monday.)\n\nThe emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News reveal him sparring over an antiviral drug with Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Obama administration health adviser, fielding questions about vaccines, and receiving an update fromMark Zuckerbergon Facebook’s plans for a coronavirus “information hub.” Zuckerberg also asked whether the social media company could provide resources to accelerate vaccine testing. And Fauci even responded to an offer from actor Morgan Fairchild to use her Twitter account on his behalf.\n\n“It would be great if you could tweet to your many Twitter followers,” he responded to Fairchild. “The American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures including social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc.”\n\nThe emails show Fauci received a flurry of correspondence about the theory that coronavirus leaked from a lab in Wuhan. One such email sent to Fauci on April 16, 2020 by Francis Collins, the director of the National Institute of Health, under the subject line \"conspiracy gains momentum\" contained a link to a news story highlighting a Fox News report that said the allegation had merit. Fauci's response to Collins is entirely blacked out.\n\nThe records also lay bare Fauci's ambivalence toward his newfound celebrity status but also his embrace of a documentary crew who would tell his story. Additionally, the emails hint at the personal toll this past year has taken on him. In one email sent on Feb. 18, weeks before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, he wrote that he had only been able to see his wife for 45 minutes in the previous 10 days.\n\nFauci, who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, declined to comment for this story.\n\nSome of the emails were reviewed by the Trump White House before being turned over to BuzzFeed News. They represent just a portion of what was requested, and they are filled with redactions, making them an incomplete record of the time period and Fauci’s correspondence. Additional tranches are expected to be released in the coming months.\n\nHowever, the emails do give a sense of the type of communicator Fauci is: courteous, low-key, and empathetic. He politely interacts with the office assistants who help him with his correspondence, and he sweats over the proper way to let people down.\n\nWhen a White House fellow and physician emails Fauci and offers to team up to write an opinion piece on the coronavirus and “unite the nation,” the NIAID director asks a colleague, “How do we nicely say no to this person?”\n\nAnd when health professionals write him with harsh criticism of Trump’s handling of the pandemic, he doesn’t take the bait. Instead, he replies with a \"thank you.\"\n\nHis tone is a mix of friendly and formal, employing phrases like “let us discuss,” “many thanks,” and — in rare displays of displeasure — a delicate “yikes!” He signs off as “Tony.”\n\nEven though he tends to sidestep controversy, Fauci does defend his decisions and push back.\n\nIn March 2020, Fauci and a f..."}

Only Connecticut, Maryland and Massachusetts do not permit such treatment.\n\nNineteen states, by contrast, have red flag laws, but they’re not always enforced because of lack of funding and training for law enforcement.\n\n“I’m sure the other states are going to want to try to get some access to some of that financial support for the programs they have since they decided not to do red flag laws,” Cornyn told reporters Tuesday.\n\nSen.Christopher S. Murphy, D-Conn., who is leading negotiations for Democrats, told reporters Wednesday the issues can be overcome.\n\nMurphy, Cornyn and other senators met Thursday and hope to have a deal by the end of the week.\n\nWhile assisted outpatient treatment allows courts to order people into outpatient treatment, especially if they have a history of repeated hospitalizations or arrests resulting from not complying with voluntary treatment, the real issue is lack of access to mental health care, said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\n“It deflects from the real problem, which is we have an underfunded, underperforming mental health system. This is a service outcome problem, not a compliance issue,” he said.\n\nHe said assisted outpatient treatment can be effective if it is targeted to a small group of people who are not going to get treatment otherwise, and if the package includes more resources for mental health.\n\nSome Democrats say they don’t necessarily oppose assisted outpatient treatment but they want to make sure there is enough funding for states to implement red flag laws, which have been shown to reduce suicides and be effective at removing firearms from people who intend to commit violence toward others.\n\n“We don’t have a disagreement on the programs that he thinks are worthwhile,” Sen.Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Thursday, referring to Cornyn. “But we want to make sure that there are sufficient amounts of money for everything good to be done, and that everything done is good in terms of stopping gun violence.”\n\nIt’s not clear yet how much funding the senators are working with or what the potential offsets will be.\n\nExperts say that if the goal of the gun violence package is to reduce gun violence, assisted outpatient treatment might not be the best pathway to doing that.\n\nAbout 4 percent of community violence can be attributed to serious mental illness, Swanson said, and there are typically other factors at play like substance use or poverty.\n\nAssisted outpatient treatmenthas been shownto reduce psychiatric admissions, emergency department visits, arrests, incarcerations, homelessness, substance use, medication nonadherence and violent behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, red flag lawshave been shownto reduce firearm suicides, which account for more than half of all gun deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“More resources are always welcome. Mandating care does not make care available,” said Hannah Wesolowski, chief government officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, referring to assisted outpatient treatment.\n\n“I don’t know that it would significantly address gun violence and have a tangible impact there.”"}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Abortion Supreme Court Unanimously Upholds Access Mifepristone Abortion Pill", "output": "TheSupreme Courtdismissed a challenge to the commonabortiondrug mifepristone Thursday, saying the plaintiffs lacked standing.\n\nThe ruling means the drug, used in the majority of abortions, may continue to be prescribed online and shipped by mail, upholding recent regulatory changes made by theFood and Drug Administration.\n\nThe decision by the high court was unanimous and written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, an appointee of former President Donald Trump. It marks a major victory for the Biden administration, which, since 2022, has sought to fight against efforts by anti-abortion groups to limit access to abortifacients in the wake of the landmark decision overturningRoe v. Wade.\n\nThelegal fightagainst mifepristone started in November 2022, when the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a group of religious doctors who oppose abortion, sued to reverse the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug.\n\nU.S. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee in the northern district ofTexas, completely suspended the FDA’s approval of the pill in April 2023, an unprecedented move that critics said destabilized the authority of the federal public health agency.\n\nThe Justice Department responded by appealing Kacsmaryk’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is considered one of the most conservative federal appellate courts in the nation.\n\nA three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit agreed with Kacsmaryk in part, overturning deregulation measures of the drug the FDA instituted in 2016 and 2021, respectively. However, the appeals court ruled that the statute of limitations had passed to overturn the drug’s approval entirely.\n\nIn 2016, the FDA increased the gestational age of pregnancy for which the abortifacient can be used, raising it from eight weeks to 10 weeks. The agency also removed in-person screening requirements for receipt of the pills in 2021 during COVID-19, allowing healthcare providers to ship the pills directly to patients by mail.\n\nTheoral argumentsfor the case before the Supreme Court in late March largely boiled down to the legal principle of standing, or whether or not the doctors who brought the suit had been sufficiently harmed by the agency’s deregulation of the pill.\n\nOB-GYN hospitalists involved in the case argued that when they are on call, they are the only ones who are able to treat patients following complications from a chemical abortion procedure. They argue that participating in the patient’s recovery, up to and including removing the unsuccessfully aborted fetus, is a violation of conscience protections.\n\nKavanaugh wrote in the final decision that the plaintiff doctors argued that they “must have standing because otherwise it may be that no one would have standing to challenge the FDA’s 2016 and 2021 actions.”\n\n“That suggestion fails because the court has long rejected that kind of argument as a basis for standing,” Kavanaugh added. “Rather, some issues may be left to the political and democratic process.”\n\nDuring oral arguments, justices seemed skeptical as to the breadth of the decision to eliminate or curtail substantially mifepristone as a remedy for a handful of doctors with ethical objections to participating in the aftermath of an abortion procedure.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett questioned both sides of the argument about whether it would be possible to create a religious exemption in hospitals to prevent physicians with ethical objections from needing to treat patients presenting with abortion complications.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom attorney Erin Hawley, representing AHM, argued that physicians often do not know until they are treating a patient whether or not she is suffering from a natural miscarriage or complications from a failed at-home abortion.\n\nHawley said the high court’s decision came down to a “legal technicality” that was “occasioned by the federal government’s about-face.”\n\n“The federal government told the Supreme Court that our pro-life doctors absolutely have federal conscience protections, even though it had said before to other federal courts that they did not. So that’s a huge win for the pro-life cause,” Hawley argued.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, the court’s longest-serving Republican-appointed jurist, sided with Kavanaugh’s opinion but took a more skeptical look at the “associational-standing doctrine” that kept the court from finding that the plaintiffs could bring the case.\n\nAssociational standing is the legal principle that would allow an organization to sue on behalf of its members to address an injury to them, even if the organization itself is unharmed.\n\nThomas agreed that the doctrine meant the anti-abortion doctors lacked standing but said the court should revisit the principle in future cases.\n\n“I am particularly doubtful of associational-standing doctrine because the court has never attempted to reconcile it with the traditional understanding of the judicial power,” Thomas wrote.\n\nThe justice added that the Supreme Court in recent times has “departed..."}

A deal’s been struck, but serious questions remain. Your membership powers the reporting that digs deeper and follows what happens next.\n\nAlready a member?Log in to hide these messages.\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nTommy Wolikow remembers the day he became aDonald Trumpsupporter.\n\nHe hadn’t previously paid attention to politics, but in July 2017 he went with his mom and aunt to a Trump rally in Youngstown, Ohio, where the president essentially promised to save his job.\n\n“Let me tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, don’t sell your house,” Trump said, to applause. “We’re going to get those jobs coming back, and we’re going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand-new ones. It’s going to happen.”\n\nEarlier that year Wolikow had been laid off from the General Motors plant in Lordstown, where he’d worked since 2008. He had high hopes that the plant might once again ramp up production and call him back. The president bolstered those hopes.\n\n“I believed what he said, and at that moment it turned me into a Trump supporter,” Wolikow said. “It made me feel that he wasn’t lying and he was being honest.”\n\nOn Monday, GM announced the plant would be “unallocated.” If the Lordstown jobs are coming back, it’s not happening soon.\n\nThe company has been dialing down production at the Lordstown plant since 2017 primarily because of weak demand for the Chevrolet Cruze manufactured there. Thanks in part to low gas prices, Americans have been buying more SUVs and crossovers (like the Honda CR-V) than smaller cars like the Cruze.\n\n“In the past four years, GM has refocused capital and resources to support the growth of its crossovers, SUVs and trucks, adding shifts and investing $6.6 billion in U.S. plants that have created or maintained 17,600 jobs,” the company said Monday. It announced that two other plants, in Detroit and Ontario, Canada, would also be shut down. Several thousand factory workersare expected to lose their jobs.\n\nWolikow, 36, had hoped either that consumers would change their minds about the Cruze or that GM would repurpose the plant to make the Chevy Blazer. Instead, the companysaid this yearit would make the Blazer in Mexico.\n\nTrump said Monday that he was unhappy about the Lordstown plant stopping production, and that GM should use the factory for another car.\n\n“They say the Chevy Cruze is not selling well. I say, ‘Well then, get a car that is selling well and put it back in,’” Trump told reporters outside the White House. “I have no doubt that in the not-too-distant future, they’ll put something else. Theybetterput something else in.”\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise of protecting American manufacturing workers from cheaper foreign labor, but so far his trade agenda has not stopped companies from making moves that are unfavorable to their U.S. employees.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who represents the area, said Trump should keep his word about jobs coming back to the Mahoning Valley.\n\n“So far, President Trump has been asleep at the switch and owes this community an explanation,” Ryan said in a statement. “He promised us that his massive corporate tax cut would lead to dramatic reinvestments in our communities. That clearly is not happening.”\n\nThe United Auto Workers union said it would fight GM’s decision to close the plants. UAW Vice President Terry Dittes called the decision “profoundly damaging to our American workforce.”\n\nBy the end of this summer, Wolikow’s enthusiasm for Trump had faded, so much so that he attended counter-rallies organized by Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed worker advocacy group that has been calling attention to U.S. companies’habitof offshoring American jobs.\n\nWolikow said he’s got three kids, and that he and his fiancee, who works at a Cracker Barrel, are racking up credit card debt just to pay for basic living expenses. He said he’s applied for dozens of jobs with no luck, even though he’s gotten a trucking license and a diesel mechanic certification.\n\nThe shutdown may be ending, but the story isn’t.

A deal’s been struck, but serious questions remain. Your membership powers the reporting that digs deeper and follows what happens next.\n\nAlready a member?Log in to hide these messages.\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nCopy Chief, HuffPost\n\nPresidentDonald Trumpsaid he’s considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who aren’t citizens ― a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment that could likely be changedonly through a constitutional amendment.\n\nTrump said in aninterview with “Axios on HBO”taped Monday that he could execute the change via executive order.\n\n“It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don’t,” Trump said. “You can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.”\n\nHe said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is “ridiculous” and that the system “has to end.”\n\nTrump also falsely stated that the U.S. is “the only country in the world” that offers citizenship to those born here. More than 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies.\n\nIt’s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed ― if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellowRepublicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the president’s authority.\n\nAll babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order.\n\nChanging that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. ― effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Even if he doesn’t follow through or succeed, though, Trump’s vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections next Tuesday.\n\nExclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenshiphttps://t.co/ckg0vs4T9O\n\nAn executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail. The Supreme Courtruled in 1898’s U.S. v. Wong Kim Arkthat a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.\n\n“The president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment’s citizenship guarantee is clear,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “This is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.”\n\nSome Republicans ― including Ryan ― quickly shot down Trump’s idea. “You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,” the House speaker said Tuesday on WVLK Radio, according toBloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson.\n\nRep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.)criticizedthe president’s statement, calling instead for immigration reform “that makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.”\n\nAnother Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible.\n\nA president cannot amend Constitution or laws via executive order. Concept of natural-born citizen in#14thAmendmentderives from natural-born subject in Britain. Phrase “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” excludes mainly foreign diplomats, who are not subject to U.S. laws.\n\nThe are some experts who disagree. AxioscitedJohn Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and director of The Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, who said the amendment has been misapplied and was not intended to apply to every person born in the U.S. regardless of parentage.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation “along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trump” to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years. It’s unclear what his legislation would look like ― and he has previouslysuggested such a changewould require a constitutional amendment.\n\n“This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,” Graham said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country“start a process” to scrap it.\n\n“I don’t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers — and I know some will disagree — but many of them agree with me and you’re going to find they do not have American citizenship. Our country is going to hell,” Trump said then in an interview withCNN.\n\nEvery time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into ou..."}

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn this Jan. 18, 2022, photo, Russian President Vladimir Putin listens during a meeting in the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia. Short of an all-out invasion, Putin could take less dramatic action in Ukraine that would vastly complicate a U.S. and allied response.(Mikhail Metzel, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Short of an all-out invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin could take less dramatic action in Ukraine that would vastly complicate a U.S. and allied response. He might carry out what President Joe Biden called a“minor incursion”— perhaps a cyberattack — leaving the U.S. and Europe divided on the type and severity of economic sanctions to impose on Moscow and ways to increase support for Kyiv.\n\nBiden drew widespread criticism for saying Wednesday that retaliating for Russian aggression in Ukraine would depend on the details. “It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do,” he said.\n\nBiden and top administration officials worked Thursday toclean up his comments. Biden stressed that if “any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion” and it would be met with a “severe and coordinated economic response.”\n\nBut even if the “minor incursion” remark was seen as a gaffe, it touched on a potentially problematic issue: While the U.S. and allies agree on a strong response to a Russian invasion, it’s unclear how they would respond to Russian aggression that falls short of that, like a cyberattack or boosted support for pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyywas among those expressing concern about Biden’s “minor incursion” remark.\n\n“We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones,” he tweeted.\n\nComplaints came quickly that Biden had made clear to Putin where and how to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its European allies, by using only a portion of the large military force he has assembled near Ukraine’s borders to take limited action. Russian officials have said they have no intention of invading Ukraine, but the deployment of a large combat force along its borders, estimated at 100,000 troops, has created fear of a crippling land war.\n\n“Deeply troubling and dangerous,” Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican and a crucial ally of Democrats on some issues, tweeted about Biden’s remark.\n\n“A greenlight for Putin,” said Republican Rep. Mike Garcia of California, one of many to use that phrase.\n\nAmong the possibilities for limited Russian military action: Putin could move much of the Russian ground force away from the border but further bolster the separatists who control the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. That conflict has killed more than 14,000 people in nearly eight years of fighting.\n\nBiden noted Thursday that “Russia has a long history of using measures other than overt military action to carry out aggression — paramilitary tactics, so-called gray zone attacks and actions by Russian soldiers not wearing Russian uniforms.”\n\nEuropean allies largely have been united with the United States in demanding that Putin not move farther into Ukrainian territory and promising a tough response if he does. But the allies appear not to have united on what political and financial penalties to enact, or even what would trigger a response.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said “any kind of incursion into Ukraine on any scale whatever” would be a disaster for Russia and for the world, but he didn’t specify a Western response. Likewise, his defense minister, Ben Wallace, told Parliament, “There is a package of international sanctions ready to go that will make sure that the Russian government is punished if it crosses the line,” but he didn’t define that line, other than warning against “any destabilizing action” by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nAsked Thursday about Biden’s comment on a “minor incursion,” a French diplomat insisted it didn’t prompt any rethinking of the “European consensus” that any new attack on Ukrainian sovereignty would have “massive and severe consequences.” But the diplomat, commenting after meeting with Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenas he conferred with European counterparts on the Ukraine crisis, wouldn’t elaborate on those consequences or what would constitute such an attack.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss his government’s take.\n\nPutin faced limited international consequences after he seized control of Ukraine’sCrimea Peninsulain 2014 and backed the separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. His central demand to the West is that NATO provide a guarantee that Ukraine never be allowed to join the alliance — a demand that Washington and its allies have roundly rejected.\n\nBiden ..."}

Border governors have warned about the dangers of the massive flow of migrants -- as well as drugs such as fentanyl -- into the United States.\n\nThe inspections have gridlocked traffic for days, with Customs and Border Protections (CBP) saying on Tuesday that wait times exceeded five hours and that commercial traffic have dropped by as much as 60%.\n\n\"The longer than average wait times – and the subsequent supply chain disruptions – are unrelated to CBP screening activities and are due to additional and unnecessary inspections being conducted by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) at the order of the Governor of Texas,\" CBP said in a statement.\n\nFIRST TEXAS BUS DROPS OFF MIGRANTS BLOCKS FROM US CAPITOL IN WASHINGTON, DC\n\nThe White House rippedinto Abbott, saying the moves are \"impacting people’s jobs and the livelihoods of hardworking American families.\"\n\n\"Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains, delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country,\" Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.\n\nBut Abbott pushed back, saying that Texas \"has been overrun with a record number of illegal immigrants crossing from Mexico into Texas with the assistance of cartels.\" He said that he had been contacted by both the Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, and all Mexican border governors.\n\n\"Until, however, those agreements are reached with those states, the Texas Department of Public Safety will continue to thoroughly inspect vehicles entering into the United States from every Mexican state except Nuevo Leon.\"\n\nHe then put the ball into the court of the White House, saying that \"the ultimate way to end the clogged border is for President Biden to do his job and to secure the border.\"\n\n\"If you want relief from the clogged border, you need to call President Biden and tell him to maintain the Title 42 expulsion policy that has been in place for years,\" he said, referring to thesoon-to-expire public health order. \"You need to tell President Biden to aggressively enforce the ‘Remain-in-Mexico’ policy. You need to call your member of Congress and insist that they hold the Biden administration accountable, and you need to demand that President Biden enforce the immigration laws that have already been passed by the US Congress,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also urged those concerned with the clogged traffic to put pressure on Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and \"urge him to collaborate with Texas to end the influx of cartel activity from Mexico into Texas.\"\n\n\"Clogged bridges can end only with the kind of collaboration we are demonstrating today between Texas and Nuevo Leon,\" he said.\n\nFox News' Jon Brown contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.\n\nHe can be reached atadam.shaw2@fox.comor onTwitter.\n\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morni..."}

But those animals were not sampled in the studies presented to the team by invited Chinese scientists.\n\nSAGO said further information about studies into the testing of these animals, as well as tracing back to source farms and serologic investigations into people who farmed and sold or traded the animals have been requested.\n\nAnother area the group identified for further study is the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, which investigations suggest “played an important role early in the amplification of the pandemic.”\n\nSeveral of the patients first detected in December 2019 had a link to the market, and environmental samples from the market tested positive for the virus, the report said.\n\nHowever, once again, big gaps remain.\n\nIt is not clear how the source of the virus was introduced to the market and where the initial spill over to humans occurred, the group said, adding that follow-up studies have not been completed.\n\n“There is a need to examine environmental samples collected from specific stalls and drains at the market in January 2020 that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in areas known to have sold live animals,” SAGO said.\n\n“Other essential studies include detailed mapping of upmarket trade of wild/domestic animals sold in Wuhan City and Hubei Province and clinical history and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans and animals from the source farms of animals sold at Wuhan markets,” the report said.\n\nSAGO’s preliminary report said it “remains important to consider all reasonable scientific data” to evaluate the possibility that Covid-19 spilled into the human population through a laboratory incident.\n\nHowever, the group said there “has not been any new data made available” to evaluate this theory and recommended further investigation “into this and all other possible pathways.”\n\nEssentially, because lab leaks have happened in the past and there is no new data available, the group said this theory cannot be ruled out.\n\nThree members from Russia, Brazil and China objected to this recommendation, “due to the fact that from their viewpoint, there is no new scientific evidence to question the conclusion” of a WHO report from March 2021 that describes the lab leak theory as “extremely unlikely.”\n\nThat report came underintense scrutiny,with the US government expressing concerns over its independence and credibility and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus admitting that its authors had problems with data access in China.\n\nNonetheless, experts have roundly condemned the theory of a laboratory origin for the virus, saying that there’s no proof of such origins or of a leak.\n\nThe team also had access to unpublishedblood samplesfrom 40,000 donors in Wuhan between September and December 2019, and reported to have been tested for Covid antibodies. Their samples could contain crucial signs of the first antibodies made by humans against the disease.\n\nAccording to the report, more than 200 samples initially tested positive for the antibodies but when tested again were not found to be positive. SAGO said it has requested further information on the data and methods used to analyze the samples.\n\nSimilarly, the group recommended further study of 76,000 Covid patients identified in the months before the..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Biden Require All Federal Employees Get Vaccinated Or Undergo Regular Testing", "output": "President Joe Biden on Thursday announceda number of new stepshis administration will take to try to get more Americans vaccinated and slow the spread of coronavirus, including requiring that all federal employees must attest to being vaccinated against Covid-19 or face strict protocols.\n\nThe new measures come amid arisein Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the US. The vast majority of those individuals with severe cases of Covid-19 are unvaccinated.\n\n“This is an American tragedy. People are dying – and will die – who don’t have to die. If you’re out there unvaccinated, you don’t have to die,” Biden said during remarks at the White House. “Read the news. You’ll see stories of unvaccinated patients in hospitals, as they’re lying in bed dying from Covid-19, they’re asking, ‘Doc, can I get the vaccine?’ The doctors have to say, ‘Sorry, it’s too late.’”\n\nIn his sternest approach yet to pushing Americans to get vaccinated, the President bluntly argued that if you are unvaccinated, “You present a problem to yourself, to your family and to those with whom you work.”\n\nBiden said every federal government employee and on-site contractor will be asked to attest to their vaccination status.\n\nEmployees who have not been vaccinated “will be required to wear a mask on the job no matter their geographic location, physically distance from all other employees and visitors, comply with a weekly or twice weekly screening testing requirement, and be subject to restrictions on official travel,” the White House said ahead of Biden’s speech.\n\nThe federal employee vaccination requirement is not a mandate, officials have insisted, and most federal employees who do not get vaccinated will not lose their jobs as a result, CNNpreviously reported.\n\nBut the decision nonetheless marks a pivot away from encouraging Americans to get vaccinated in their own time and stepping toward placing the onus on unvaccinated individuals.\n\nOther efforts the administration debuted Thursday to incentivize vaccinations included expanding paid leave for employees who take time off to get themselves and their family members vaccinated. Biden said employers would be reimbursed. He also called on states, territories, and local governments to do more to incentivize vaccination, including offering $100 to Americans getting vaccinated, paid for with American Rescue Plan funding.\n\n“I know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks who got vaccinated already. But here’s the deal: if incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them. We all benefit,” Biden said.\n\nThe President also announced that he is ordering the Department of Defense “to look into how and when they will add Covid-19 to the list of vaccinations our Armed Forces must get.”\n\n“Our men and women in uniform, who protect this country from grave threats, should be protected as much as possible from getting Covid-19,” he said. “I think this is particularly important because our troops serve in places throughout the world, many where vaccination rates are low and disease is prevalent,” Biden added.\n\nAll military and civilian Defense Department personnel will be asked to attest to their vaccination status, the department said Thursday evening. Those unable or unwilling to do so will “be required to wear a mask, physically distance, comply with a regular testing requirement and be subject to official travel restrictions,” Jamal Brown, deputy Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nThe department is also considering adding the Covid vaccine to the list of required vaccines for military personnel.\n\n“Secretary (of Defense Lloyd) Austin will begin consulting our medical professionals, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to determine how and when to make recommendations to the President with respect to adding the COVID-19 vaccines to the full list of requirements for military personnel,” Brown said.\n\nThe President on Thursday also called on school districts nationwide to host at least one pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks in an effort to get more kids 12 and older vaccinated.\n\nResponding to reporter questions after his remarks, the President said he didn’t know yet whether the federal government had the power to require vaccines. “It’s still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country” require vaccines, he said, adding that he expects the vaccines will be fully approved by the US Food and Drug Administration by the fall.\n\nBut soon after the President’s speech, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer the administration is not considering a nationwide Covid-19 vaccine requirement.\n\n“That’s not an authority that we’re exploring at all,” Zients said on “The Situation Room.”\n\nOn Monday, the Justice Departmentdeterminedthat federal law doesn’t prohibit public agencies and private businesses from requiring Covid-19 vaccines – even if the vaccines have only emergency use authorization so far..."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Trump Sues Facebook Twitter And Google", "output": "In this article\n\nFormer PresidentDonald Trumptook his fight with three massive tech companies to court, filing lawsuits that legal experts say are all but guaranteed to fail – even as they rally Republican voters, fundraisers and donors.\n\nTrump revealed Wednesday that he is suingFacebook,TwitterandGoogle, as well as their respective CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai, in class-action lawsuits.\n\nTrump, who has a history of threatening legal actionbut not always following through, made the announcement at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, alongside two leaders from the America First Policy Institute, the pro-Trump nonprofit group that is supporting the lawsuits.\n\nShortly after the news conference wrapped, Trump's political entities started sending out fundraising messages that touted the lawsuits in their appeals for money. One such text message, written as if it were coming from Trump himself, includes a link to his joint fundraising committee Save America, which also raises money for other Republican political initiatives.\n\nThe lawsuits were unveiled just over a month after Facebook decided touphold Trump's ban from using the platform until at least January 2023. Twitter, Trump's preferred social media outlet throughout his one term in office, permanently banned him on the heels of the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters.\n\nThe lawsuit against Pichai also names as a defendant YouTube, the video-sharing website bought by Google in 2006. YouTube indefinitely banned Trump in January.\n\n\"We're not looking to settle,\" Trump told reporters at Bedminster when asked about the lawsuits. \"We don't know what's going to happen but we're not looking to settle,\" he said.\n\nThe three related lawsuits, filed in federal court in Florida, allege the tech giants have violated plaintiffs' First Amendments rights.\n\nThe suits want the court to order the media companies to let Trump back on their platforms. They also want the court to declare that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a piece of legislation that stops tech companies from being held liable for what users post on their platforms, is unconstitutional.\n\nAs president, Trump railed against Section 230 and repeatedly called for its repeal. He eventied the issue to a crucial round of stimulus checksat the height ofthe coronavirus pandemic, as well as the passage of an annual defense spending bill.\n\nLegal experts doubt whether Trump's latest attack on big tech companies will succeed.\n\n\"I think the lawsuit has almost no chance of success,\" Vanderbilt University law professor Brian Fitzpatrick told CNBC in a phone interview.\n\nThe tech platforms are private entities, not government institutions, and therefore the plaintiffs' claims about constitutional violations do not hold up, Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe professor added that he was unconvinced by the argument in the lawsuits that the companies should be treated like government, because their conduct, including alleged coordination with then-President-elect Joe Biden's transition team, \"amount[s] to state action.\"\n\n\"I think this is just a public relations lawsuit,\" Fitzpatrick said, \"and I'll be honest with you, I wouldn't be surprised if it ends with sanctions against the lawyers for filing a frivolous lawsuit.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the legal actions. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump's spokeswoman, Liz Harrington, declined to comment ahead of the former president's speech.\n\nThe attorney representing Trump in the lawsuits, Matthew Lee Baldwin of Vargas, Gonzalez, Baldwin, Delombard, did not immediately respond to questions from CNBC about how many suits Trump planned to file, and whether these suits have all been filed in court yet or not.\n\nWall Street seemed largely unfazed by the news, as shares of Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nFacebook was last seen off its session high north of 1% with a gain of 0.1%, while Alphabet added about 0.2%. Twitter was off its intraday low, but shed 0.5% in choppy trading. The moves in the social media stocks compared with a loss of 0.1% for the S&P 500 and a dip of 0.3% for the Nasdaq.\n\nThe announcement comes on the same day thatThe Guardian newspaper in the U.K.reported that the upcoming book \"Frankly, We Did Win This Election\" claims that Trump praised Adolf Hitler to his then-chief of staff John Kelly. Trump allegedly said, \"Well, Hitler did a lot of good things.\"\n\nTrump denied he said it, according to the book's author, Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender, the Guardian said.\n\nHarrington in a statement to NBC News said the reporting \"is totally false. President Trump never said this. It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired.\"\n\n—CNBC's Tom Franck contributed to this report.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

That triggered a review by a human moderator, who labeled Kelley’s tweet “misleading” despite the fact that she had included data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in her post.\n\n“In my review of internal files, I found countless instances of tweets labeled as ‘misleading’ or taken down entirely, sometimes triggering account suspensions, simply because they veered from CDC guidance or differed from establishment views,” wrote Zweig, who also pointed out that moderation decisions were made by contractors in overseas places like the Philippines.\n\n“They were given decision trees to aid in the process, but tasking nonexperts to adjudicate tweets on complex topics like myocarditis and mask efficacy data was destined for a significant error rate,” he wrote.\n\nAt the time of her tweet being labeled “misleading,” Kelley K said she had inquired to Twitter about the matter and received a response that thesocial media giant wantedto “prioritize review and labeling of content that could lead to increased exposure or transmission” — with no regard for whether the information was correct.\n\n“Twitter’s misinformation policy around Covid only goes one way,” he wrote. “It specifically allows tweets that exaggerate the risks of Covid, and only applies to tweets that they think ‘minimize’ Covid … Fear over facts is basically the official policy of Twitter’s censors when it comes to Covid.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrictly necessary cookies are essential for the website to function correctly.

They are forced to skip meals when they cannot cobble together the money to buy supplies, and must rely on neighbors for bathroom use.\n\nA study in London, England, found that a relatively small increase in exposure to nitrogen dioxide led to a 32% increase in the risk of needing community-based treatment and an 18% increase in the risk of being admitted to hospital.\n\nSome properties come with more than a leaky bathroom faucet or a floorboard that creaks. Someproperties are “stigmatized”– either because of some gory history, such as being a site of grisly murders or because they are purportedly haunted. While half of states have a law requiring disclosure of a property’s history, the other half operate undercaveat emptor– buyer beware.\n\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

The National Archives has asked representatives of Trump to continue the search for more presidential documents, Ferriero said.\n\nFerriero did not elaborate on how many items were found marked as “classified national security information” and said the National Archives has been working on inventorying the new materials it received from Trump. The boxes contained mementos from Trump’s White House days, such as letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former President Barack Obama, according to theWashington Post.\n\nFerriero’s letter came in response to questions from New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, who asked about the materialsthe National Archives recently recoveredfrom Mar-a-Lago. At one point, Maloney asked if the National Archives was aware of Trump destroying records during his time in the White House. There have been multiple reports that Trump ripped up documents during his time in office. One report suggested he may haveflushed documentsdown a White House toilet. Trump denied doing so.\n\n“In June 2018, NARA learned from a press report inPoliticothat textual Presidential records were being torn up by former President Trump and that White House staff were attempting to tape them back together. NARA sent a letter to the Deputy Counsel to the President asking for information about the extent of the problem and how it is being addressed,” Ferriero said. “Although White House staff during the Trump Administration recovered and taped together some of the torn-up records, a number of other torn-up records that were transferred had not been reconstructed by the White House.”\n\nFerriero said the National Archives has identified some records from the Trump White House that are not in its possession. He said the agency found social media records that were not preserved by the Trump administration and learned that members of the Trump administration conducted official business on “non-official electronic messaging accounts” that were not preserved. He said the agency is trying to acquire some of those records.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to theWashington Examiner’srequest for comment. Trump responded in a statement released by his Save America PAC on Friday evening.\n\n“The National Archives did not ‘find’ anything, they were given, upon request, Presidential Records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act. If this was anyone but ‘Trump,’ there would be no story here. Instead, the Democrats are in search of their next Scam,” Trump said.\n\nHe also said, “The Fake News is making it seem like me, as the President of the United States, was working in a filing room.”\n\nThe National Archives’s referralled to internal discussions about how the department should proceed, sources told theWashington Post.Trump turned the documents over to the National Archives to comply with the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which requires presidential administrations to preserve documents. There are noclear penaltiesfor presidents that violate the law, but there are different laws that govern the handling of classified information.\n\nThe Trump administration’s handling of documents has reportedly affected the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot. A source told theWashington Post,the committee sought documents about efforts to put pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to decertify the election but discovered the documents no longer existed because they had been shredded. On Wednesday, the Biden administrationordered the National Archivesto turn over the Trump White House visitor logs to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nNotifications"}

And approximately 27,000 migrants were in CBP custody as of Wednesday night, another record, with more arriving and more being released into the United States by the hour.\n\nIn the region surrounding Tucson, CBP processing centers are often at double their capacity. The two Homeland Security officials told NBC News that Border Patrol agents are dropping off busloads of migrants every half-hour in downtown Nogales, Arizona, to alleviate crowding in processing centers.\n\nFrom there, the migrants are typically assisted by a local nongovernmental organization, most often Casa Alitas, which told NBC News that it is seeing a record number of migrants in its shelters and added pressure to help provide transportation elsewhere.\n\n“It’s an extra burden that we’ve all had to lift, making sure that people were not left an hour or two hours away from an airport or major travel hub,” Casa Alitas Director Diego Lopez said.\n\nLopez and his staff help migrants book travel to the interior of the U.S. But he says his organization’s resources are running thin. Casa Alitas used to provide things like toys and teddy bears to migrant children, but has had to stop since it now shelters more than 10,000 migrants per week.\n\n“We can only focus on helping support people with a meal, clothing and helping people move on to their sponsors,” he said. “The last few months, as a shelter, we have been breaking records week to week.”\n\nFurther east, in the border region encompassing Eagle Pass, Texas, hundreds of migrants are amassed under a bridge, and federal facilities are at almost three times their capacity. Border Patrol officials in that sector are using more than 40 buses per day to send migrants from that area to other parts of the Texas border to alleviate overcrowding.\n\nThousands of migrants wait in the field for CBP to bring them to a processing center, but the sector has so far not released migrants onto the streets.\n\nDespite the high numbers, migrants are still being released in under 72 hours, the court-mandated limit for how long they can stay in CBP processing centers. From there, a small number of migrants may be taken to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but most are released.\n\nThe strain has actually proven the efficiency of new technologies that let CBP quickly screen migrants for potential medical conditions or national security threats and then release them. Previous migrant surges, such as in 2019, had left migrants in inhumane conditions. Some weren’t able to lie down to sleep in CBP processing centers.\n\nAll of those currently being released by CBP have court dates and locations where they must appear for their immigration hearings, the three Homeland Security officials said. Earlier this year, to alleviate overcrowding, CBP began releasing migrants without court dates and with only a notice to report to an ICE office. The Biden administration has since been blocked by courts from using that practice.\n\nThe head of CBP, Troy Miller, is asking Congress for more money to help his agency handle the record numbers.\n\n“The encounter levels we are currently seeing across the southwest border are presenting a serious challenge to the men and women of CBP,” said Miller, the senior official performing the duties of the commissioner, as he is not Senate-confirmed to the position. “CBP and our federal partners need additional funding from Congress so that we can continue to effectuate consequences for those who do not use the established pathways.”\n\nMeanwhile, Senate negotiations that could ultimately deliver more funding to CBP remain unresolved as many lawmakers head home ahead of the Christmas holidays.\n\nI am NBC News’ Senior Homeland Security Correspondent.\n\nDidi Martinez is a producer for NBC News' national security unit.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"}

She also brought her 7-year-old son to the church, who was struck during the crossfire with a pair of off-duty officers and remains in critical condition.\n\nChristopher Hassig, the commander of the Houston Police Department’s homicide division, said Moreno was engaged in an ongoing dispute with her ex-husband, who is Jewish, and his family. He said that beef and her ex-husband’s religion “might possibly be where all of this stems from.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“We do believe that there was a familial dispute that has taken place between her ex-husband and her ex-husband’s family,” Hassig said. “And some of those individuals are Jewish.”\n\nMoreno’s former mother-in-law, Walli Carranza, however, casted doubt that the shooting was related to religious hate. Instead, she placed the fault of the shooting on Texas agencies, specifically the child protective services of Harris and Montgomery counties who “refused to remove custody from a woman with known mental illness.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Although my former daughter-in-law raged against Israel and Jews in a pro-Palestinian rant yesterday this has nothing to do with Judaism or Islam,” Carranza wrote in a Facebook post. “Nothing! But this is what happens when reckless and irresponsible reporting lets people with severe mental illness have an excuse for violence.”\n\nMoreno, who police said also went by the alias Jeffrey Escalante,was shot dead by two off-duty law enforcement officers after she entered Lakewood Church with an AR-15-style rifle and another unused gun as a Spanish-language service was set to commence on Sunday afternoon, authorities said. Hassig said he believes Moreno legally purchased a gun in December—something that led Carranza to criticize Texas for “not having strong red flag laws that would have prevented her from owning or possessing a gun.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLakewood Church has approximately 45,000 attendees per week, the congregation says on its website.\n\nHassig said Moreno never made it into the church’s sanctuary and that all of the shooting occurred in a hallway on the building’s west side. He added that it is still being determined the exact motivation Moreno had to carry out the shooting.\n\nTwo others were injured in an exchange of gunfire, Hassig said, including Moreno’s young son, who Carranza identified as Samuel Moreno-Carranza. He was listed as being in critical condition on Sunday after being shot in the head. A representative for the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office told theHouston Chroniclethat the child was not expected to survive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Sam is seven years old and is clinging to life today at Texas Children’s Hospital as I fly there from Mexico and his father from Florida,” Carranza said.\n\nA close friend of Carranza who answered a call from The Daily Beast on Monday said the “whole family is shell-shocked.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA second victim, a 56-year-old man, was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the leg—though authorities said he was stable and was out of the hospital by Monday afternoon.\n\nThe brief incident began when shots rang out around 1:50 p.m. local time, withMoreno confirmed to be dead just after 2 p.m. by firefighters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecords showMoreno had a lengthy rap sheet that went back as far as 2005, with charges that included assault, forgery, marijuana possession, theft, evading and unlawful carrying of a weapon. Records show she had an address in Conroe, about 50 miles north of Lakewood.\n\nPolice said as many as 12 shots were fired inside the church, though they didn’t specify how many came from Moreno. Audio of the gunfire was picked up on a livestream the church was airing from its Spanish-language service.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouston Police Chief Troy Finner said said Sunday that Moreno also threatened she “had a bomb,” but authorities didn’t find anything in her backpack and vehicle. She reportedly wore a trench coat into the service.\n\nOvernight, federal and state law enforcement raided a home in Conroe that was connected to Moreno, local news outlets reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarranza said Moreno suffered from schizophrenia, but was a “very sweet and loving woman” when she was on the proper medication.\n\nThe shooting rattled the church community at Lakewood, with Osteen struggling to find the words to describe the horror felt by those in the service, adding that there likely would have been more victims had shots been fired during the church’s 11 a.m. service rather than in-between events.

Wadecould impact November's midterm elections.\n\nIn the first electoral test since theSupreme Courtoverturned the 1973 ruling giving women a federal right to an abortion in June, more than 59 percent of people in Kansasbacked upholdingthe state's constitutional right for women to access the procedure.\n\nGiven that former Republican PresidentDonald Trumpwon the state by 15 points (56-41) only two years ago, Monday's referendum result is considered a landslide, pointing to unhappiness with the Supreme Court's decision onDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Center, regardless of voters' political persuasion.\n\nPolling also points to abortion and the push by the GOP to restrict access to it, being a hot-button issue ahead of the midterm elections on November 8 in whichDemocratsare fighting to retain control ofCongress.\n\nIn May, electoral analysis firm Split Ticket said banning abortion \"is extremely unpopular among voters\" and that \"Republicanshave far more pro-choice voters than Democrats have pro-life ones.\"\n\nIt cited data that showed 59 percent of Americans favored keeping abortion mostly legal, compared with only 39 percent who wanted to make it mostly illegal.\n\nThe data from June drawn from a Pew Survey came before the Supreme Court ruling but after a leaked draft of its majority opinion surfaced the previous month. The poll also found over one-third of Republicans, or 35 percent, favored keeping abortion legal in most or all cases.\n\n\"Kansas is a state where pre-Dobbspolls usually indicated a close split on abortion rights,\" Split Ticket partner Lakshya Jain told Newsweek. Our pre-ruling survey aggregates suggested that it was about four points in the pro-life direction. For the referendum to be defeated by double digits here is a resounding statement by an electorate and points to states like Michigan comprehensively voting in favor of it.\"\n\nHe added: \"One thing to note is that Democrats had a massive surge in turnout here, which points to the issue being a motivating factor for many, especially when a referendum is on the ballot. That bodes well for Dems in states where this is a hot topic.\"\n\nAnother survey released by national health non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) on Tuesday found that nearly two-thirds of the public (65 percent) disapproved of the Supreme Court's decision onDobbs.\n\nThe survey also found that 61 percent of respondents—including most Democrats, independents, and women between the ages of 18 and 49, as well as about half of those living in states with pre-Roeabortion bans or trigger laws—wanted their state to guarantee abortion access.\n\nThis is more than twice the number of those who want the laws in their state to ban abortion (25 percent) according to the survey conducted between July 7 and 17 with a 4 percent margin for error.\n\nRachel Fey, vice president of policy & strategic partnerships at Power to Decide, said that the polling leading up to theDobbsdecision showed it was \"very clear\" people wantedRoe v. Wadeto stay the law of the land. The Kansas referendum \"was a full rebuke in the middle of the country,\" to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"People out there may have questioned whether those polls reflected everyone in the United States or just folks on the east and west coast,\" she toldNewsweek, \"but in my years of working in reproductive health and rights, I have come across strong pro- abortion, pro-freedom movements across the country.\n\n\"I think the reaction of Kansans to the threat of losing their access to abortion was resounding 'no'—this was not a close call,\" she said. \"Kansas is surrounded by states that are banning abortion care, and this is really meaningful for people who are trying to seek that care.\n\n\"There are abortion supporters of all political stripes, and they're angry and there's a sense of rage,\" she said.\n\n\"For a very long time policymakers to pursue anti-abortion policies have been out of step not just with Democrats, not just with independents, but with Republicans as well. And the polling continues to bear that out.\"\n\nSenate Minority leaderMitch McConnellhas batted away suggestions that the referendum could reshape the midterms, tellingFox Newson Wednesday, \"I don't think we really know until the end of the year\" about its impact.\n\nThe Republican from Kentucky, a state which following the Supreme Court ruling has reinstated a near-total ban on abortion, told Fox News that the vote \"tells us there were a lot of people interested in the issue in Kansas.\"\n\nThe referendum result hailed by PresidentJoe Bidenshows that the U.S. is not neatly divided down the center and highlights unease, even among some conservatives, at theDobbsruling.\n\nMeanwhile, polling such as from Democratic firm HIT Strategies says that abortion restrictions will make key Democratic constituencies more motivated to vote.

The first phase, kicking off in early November, will allow fully vaccinated visitors traveling for nonessential reasons, like visiting friends or for tourism, to cross US land borders. The second phase, starting in early January 2022, will apply the vaccination requirement to all inbound foreign travelers, whether traveling for essential or nonessential reasons.\n\n“These new vaccination requirements deploy the best tool we have in our arsenal to keep people safe and prevent the spread of Covid-19 and will create a consistent, stringent protocol for all foreign nationals traveling into the United States whether by land or air,” a senior administration official told reporters.\n\nThe US has beenlimiting nonessential travel on the groundalong its borders with Canada and Mexico since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and extending those restrictions on a monthly basis.

The restrictions don’t apply to cross-border trade, US citizens and lawful permanent residents, as well as people traveling for medical purposes or to attend school, among others.\n\nThe latest set of restrictions is due to expire on October 21. Senior administration officials said the limits on cross-border travel will remain in effect until a soon-to-be-disclosed date in November.\n\nA Trump-era public health order that’s allowed for the swift expulsion of more than 958,000 migrants will also stay in effect. Those restrictions, while also based on public health, are necessary because of concerns over migrants in congregate settings when undergoing processing, officials said.\n\nThe travel restrictions had come under heavy scrutiny by lobbyists, lawmakers and border mayors who implored the Biden administration to adjust limits to meet the evolving landscape.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul welcomed the news Tuesday night. “I applaud our federal partners for reopening our borders to Canada, something I have called for since the beginning of the closure,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Canada is not only our trade partner, but more importantly, Canadians are our neighbors and our friends.”\n\nNew York Rep. Brian Higgins, a Democrat who represents a Buffalo-area district, also heralded the decision, saying that “strong vaccination rates in Canada made the continued border shutdown absurd and unjustifiable.”\n\n“For months now we’ve heard from businesses that are suffering and families distraught over the separation imposed by the continued border shutdown. The sigh of relief coming from the Northern Border communities following this announcement is so loud it can practically be heard on either end of the Peace Bridge.”\n\nWhen asked about the timeline for reopening borders, the White House has repeatedly pointed to interagency working groups that were formed over the summer. Overseen by the White House Covid-19 response team and the National Security Council, the groups included representatives from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with officials from the Departments of State, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Transportation.\n\nAmerican officials were also partnered with representatives from the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico.\n\n“We have seen increased vaccine availability obviously in Canada, which now has very high vaccination rates, as well as in Mexico. And we wanted to have a consistent approach to both land and air entry into this country and so this is the next step to bring those into alignment,” the senior administration official said.\n\nThe US previously told the Canadians that the Biden administration wanted to keep rules on both land borders symmetrical, a source familiar with discussions told CNN, despite differing situations on both borders and inconsistencies with air travel rules.\n\nThe US-Mexico border has been facing an influx of migrants that has overwhelmed resources, prompting some concern among US Customs and Border Protection officials about easing travel restrictions on the US southern border while surging personnel to assist with an uptick in migrants.\n\nCBP will be charged with enforcing the newly announced vaccination requirement, including seeking attestations of vaccination status and spot checking travelers for verification of vaccination status via paper or digital means, according to another senior administration official. There will not be a testing requirement.\n\nThis story has been updated with reaction.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

What isn't yet clear is whether China will feel the consequences as Russia has.\n\nOn Friday, PresidentJoe Bidenannouncedthat the United States, along withNATOmembers,European Unioncountries, and Group of Seven nations, will withdraw \"most favored nation\" trade privileges for Russia. Biden also announced bans on imports of Russian goods—seafood, vodka, and diamonds—and a prohibition on exports of luxury items.\n\nThese actions, at least on their face, run afoul of trade rules. Russia has MFN, most-favored-nation status, now in America renamed PNTR or permanent normal trade relations. A nation with PNTR will receive the trade benefits accorded to all other nations with PNTR.\n\n\"Putin is an aggressor—is the aggressor,\" Biden said on Friday. \"And Putin must pay the price.\"\n\nThe president is right. But China, playing a particularly malign role in Ukraine, should also pay the price.\n\nBeginning February 4, when Beijing and Moscow proclaimed their \"no limits\" partnership in a 5,000-wordcommunique, Russia announced large commodity sales of oil, gas, and coal to China, and Beijing removed restrictions on the importation of Russian wheat. In other words, China is giving Russia the cash to wage war in Eastern Europe.\n\nBeijing is, in addition, making its financial system available to Russian institutions as the U.S. and Europe cut them off, so expect Russian banks to soon join the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, China's version of SWIFT. Russians, after Visa and Mastercard pulled out of their country, can now sign up for China's UnionPay card.\n\nMoreover, Beijing is putting its diplomats in the service of Russia and using state media to propagate ludicrous Russian narratives about the war.\n\nChina was clearly involved in Vladimir Putin's planning for the invasion. Beijing persuaded Moscow to postpone its attack until the Beijing WinterOlympicsended, according toThe New York Times. The Olympic flame was extinguished February 20. Russia invaded February 24.\n\nIn the U.S., legislation—not presidential action—decides which countries are accorded PNTR. Last March, three Republican senators—Tom Cotton of Arkansas, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, and Rick Scott of Florida—introduced the China Trade Relations Act, which would revoke PNTR for Beijing. The bill, among other things, would go back to pre-2001 rules requiring China to obtain MFN status each year. This yearly review gaveCongressthe opportunity to examine Chinese behavior.\n\nStaunch human rights defender Rep. Chris Smith, the New Jersey Republican, and New York Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi will, this week, co-sponsor a bill to take away China's PNTR status. \"Many if not most business and political leaders, Republican and Democrat, bought into the 'China Fantasy,' overlooking human rights abuses while saying increased trade will make China more like us,\" Smith, co-chair of the House's Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, toldNewsweek. \"It was not true then, and it's not true now.\"\n\nSmith believes Congress should \"make annual renewal of normal trade relations contingent on concrete progress on human rights.\"\n\nSmith is correct. With PNTR safely in hand, China's regime has been free to embark on genocide and other crimes against humanity, most notably against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Turkic minorities. Now, it is, among other aggressive acts, directly supporting Russia's slaughter of Ukrainians. Beijing is pressuring India, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and others. The U.S. should not trade with countries committing atrocities at home and aggression abroad.\n\nThere's a legal hiccup. U.S., China, and Russia are members of the World Trade Organization. Generally, a revocation of MFN-PNTR status violates the WTO's core non-discrimination principle because revocation permits the revoking country to treat the target nation differently than the revoker treats other members.\n\nAs a practical matter, Biden's move to withdraw PNTR is, as Washington, D.C.-based trade expert Alan Tonelson tellsNewsweek, \"largely symbolic for a variety of practical reasons.\"\n\nWhy? As an initial matter, the U.S. almost certainly will argue that the WTO's \"national security\" exception applies so it can discriminate against Russia and China.\n\nRussia and China, however, will not agree, and they could initiate cases before the WTO's dispute-resolution mechanism.\n\nFortunately for America, that will help neither Moscow nor Beijing. WTO rules structurally favor nations that intentionally violate the rules, because no trade penalties may be imposed unless a nation continues violative conduct after a WTO dispute-resolution panel issues a ruling. A ruling can take years.\n\nYet neither Russia nor China can obtain a decision against the U.S. because, thanks to the Trump and Biden administrations, the trade organization cannot field a ..."}

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.\n\nJulie Swetnick, who has made uncorroborated and lurid sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, is facing credibility questions as she appears to partially walk back some of her more salacious claims about the embattled nominee and details about her past emerge.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bill Cassidy even suggested the FBI scrutinize her in response, tweeting:\n\n\"A criminal referral should be sent to the FBI/DOJ regarding the apparently false affidavit signed by Julie Swetnick that was submitted to the Senate by @MichaelAvenatti.\"\n\nSwetnick, in a sworn statement last month, claimed she had seen Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls” including “grinding” against girls and attempting to remove their clothes in the early '80s. She also claimed she “became aware of efforts by [friend] Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to ‘spike’ the ‘punch’ at house parties” with drugs or alcohols to lower girls’ defenses and get them disoriented so they could be “gang raped” in a side room by a “train” of boys.\n\n“I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their 'turn' with a girl inside the room,” she said. “These boys included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh.” She said she later became a victim of one of these gang rapes, at which she said Kavanaugh and Judge were present. The allegations represented the third sexual assault claim against Kavanaugh, but by far the most lurid and serious.\n\nYet in an interview with NBC News, she appeared to walk back some of the claims about Kavanaugh, while standing by her claims of sexually aggressive behavior. While she said in her statement she became aware of “efforts” by Kavanaugh to spike the punch, she said in the interview she was unclear about what Kavanaugh was actually doing.\n\n“Well I saw—I saw him giving red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame, and there was grain punch at those parties,\" she said. \"I saw him around the punch—I won’t say bowls, the punch containers. I don’t know what he did, but I saw him by them.”\n\nAs for the claim about “trains” of boys lining up outside rooms to rape girls, she said in the interview she saw boys including Kavanaugh and Judge \"huddled by doors.\" Asked if she was suggesting she thought Kavanaugh was involved, she answered: \"I would say yes, it's just too coincidental.\" She did not offer further details to support the claim he was waiting his \"turn.\"\n\nShe also clarified that while she saw Kavanaugh and Judge at the party and where other boys were gathered, she “cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me” -- her original statement did not specifically accuse them of assaulting her, either.\n\nMeanwhile, she said she told her mother and the Montgomery County Police the next day. Police officials told NBC News it could take up to a month to recover documents related to any report she may have made. Further, NBC reported that both her mother and the officer she said she spoke with have died.\n\nSwetnick has struggled to provide corroborating witnesses, though her statement said she was aware of other witnesses who could \"attest to the truthfulness\" of her account. Swetnick providedfour names to NBC Newsto back up her story: One is dead, two did not respond to NBC requests and one other said he didn’t remember Swetnick and didn’t think he had socialized with her.\n\nSwetnick’s shifting, uncorroborated claims also led NBC News to issue a statement ahead of the interview.\n\n\"NBC News, for the record, has not been able to independently verify her claims. There are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statements last week,\" host Kate Snow told viewers.\n\nKavanaugh has called Swetnick's accusations a \"joke,\" while Judge has said he \"categorically\" denies her claims.\n\nLawyer Michael Avenatti, who is representing her, responded to some of the controversy by saying that Swetnick is willing to take a polygraph test and told CNN he had done “significant due diligence” before going ahead with them. Avenatti, who has also represented adult film star Stormy Daniels in her legal fight against President Trump and has floated the possibility of a 2020 Democratic presidential run, has fueled Republican claims that the impetus behind the sexual assault claims is politically motivated.\n\nRNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel questioned her claims, as well as Avenatti's involvement.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, mocked Democrats for entertaining Swetnick’s claims as “credible allegations.”\n\nBut other questions about Swetnick’s acco..."}

After Hamas launched an attack against Israel on October 7, Biden backed Israel's right to defend itself and has voiced support for increasing aid. While the president has expressed concerns about the number of civilian deaths, critics say he hasn't gone far enough to ensure protections orpush for a ceasefire.\n\nHamas' October 7 strike on Israel left roughly 1,200 people dead, with an estimated 250 people taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

The act requires a president tonotify Congress publicly of the national emergencyand to report every six months. The law also says the president must renew the emergency every year, simply by notifying Congress.\n\nThe House and Senate can revoke a declaration by majority vote, but it would take a two-thirds vote by each house to override an expected presidential veto.\n\nBeyond that, the law doesn't say what constitutes a national emergency or impose any other limits on the president.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) released a statement saying the president invoked sections 12302, 284(b)(7), and 2808 of Title X of the U.S. Code.\n\nSection 12302 authorizes \"involuntary activation\" of reserve troops to perform a \"federal mission at the direction of the secretary of defense.\" Section 284(b)(7) allows the DOD to support counter-drug activities of other federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \"with the construction of roads, fences, and lighting\" to disrupt drug trafficking.\n\nSection 2808 of Title X authorizes the Defense secretary to decide whether barriers are necessary to support the actions of the armed services, and to redirect unobligated military construction funds to construct the border barriers.\n\nThebroad grant of discretion to the presidentcould make it hard to persuade courts to rule that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority in declaring a border emergency.\n\n\"He's the one who gets to make the call. We can't second-guess it,\" said John Eastman, a professor of constitutional law at the Chapman University School of Law.\n\nCourts often are reluctant to look beyond the justifications the president included in his proclamation, Ohio State University law professor Peter Shane said on a call organized by the liberal American Constitution Society.\n\nBut other legal experts said the facts are powerfully arrayed against the president. They include government statistics showing a decades-long decline in illegal border crossings, as well as Mr. Trump's rejection of a deal last year that would have provided more than the nearly $1.4 billion he got for border security in the budget agreement he signed Thursday.\n\nOpponents of the declaration also are certain to use Mr. Trump's own words at his Rose Garden news conference Friday to argue that there is no emergency on the border.\n\n\"I could do the wall over a longer period of time,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.\"\n\nACLU executive director Anthony Romero said Mr. Trump's remarks are an admission that there is no national emergency. \"He just grew impatient and frustrated with Congress,\" Romero said in a statement.\n\nHowever, trying to turn the president's words against hi..."}

Gavin Newsom, speaking at a news conference to discuss recovery from the wildfires that devastated the city earlier this year, called the operation \"theater.\"\n\n“What a disgrace, what's happening in MacArthur Park. What theater. On the six-month anniversary, after all, of these fires -- that's the message from the polluted heart of the President of the United States, the polluted heart of [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller,” Newsom said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who or what was targeted. Bass posted a video of agents, some on horseback, moving in what she called a \"skirmish line\" across the mostly empty park.\n\nThe mayor said she didn't believe anyone was detained, \"but then again, I don't think the goal is to detain. I think the goal is to spread fear. I think that's what it is. It's to terrorize Angelenos. It's to say to immigrants that are in our city of immigrants that they need to stay home, they shouldn't go to work, they shouldn't go to school, because we're coming after you.\"\n\nHours after the raid, federal authorities wouldn't say why they were at the park or what they were looking for, or if any arrests were made.\n\nDefense officials had said the troops were deployed to set up a security perimeter to protect federal law enforcement officials against potentially hostile crowds.\n\nAll of the troops involved in the operation were activated members of the California National Guard.\n\nThe operation included some 17 Humvees, four military cargo trucks and two military ambulances, officials said.\n\nThe armed troops were told in advance of the raid that they could defend themselves and federal employees if needed. If  a person was a threat, the troops could detain the individual briefly before handing them off to law enforcement, officials said.\n\nEarlier this summer, Trump deployed some 4,700 troops to California under a law known as Title 10, which allows the use of military forces to protect federal personnel and federal property.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}

Those taking the military oath, for instance, pledge to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\".\n\nOver the past decade, members have shown up at a number of protests and armed standoffs across the country.\n\nMore than a dozen members of the group were charged earlier this year in connection with the 6 January 2021 storming of the US Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nA former Oath Keepers spokesman told a congressional committee investigating the Capitol attack that the group has come to embrace white nationalists and other \"straight-up racists\".\n\n\"I think we've gotten exceedingly lucky that more bloodshed did not happen because the potential has been there from the start,\" Jason Van Tatenhove said in July testimony before the committee.\n\nMr Rhodes and four other Oath Keepers will go on trial later this month on charges of seditious conspiracy, a US Civil War-era charge that carries up to 20 years in prison.\n\nEven after the budget cleared Congress, it will still take days to reopen the government.\n\nOnce signed by President Donald Trump, the spending bill will reopen the government after 43 days.\n\nIn emails released by Democrats, Epstein says Trump \"knew about the girls\".

It muddles his message to Beijing as well as to his White House aides, the State Department, and the Pentagon, Mazza said.\n\n“It’s fair to assume that he is personally committed to come to Taiwan’s defense in the event that China opts to attack,” he told theWashington Examiner. “I tend to agree that the policy that the president is suggesting is right. I just think the way that we’re going about it is all wrong and very confusing.”\n\nMazza decoupled Biden’s China-Taiwan comments in Japan from a State Department website update removing language stipulating that the United States does not support Taipei’s independence. For Mazza, the update was a clarification rather than a change. But he recommended that Foggy Bottom conduct a comprehensive Taiwan policy review so there is better synergy between the president’s position and global conditions.\n\nStrategic ambiguity is premised on the idea that China should not know whether the U.S. would intercede if it uses force against Taiwan, and Taipei should not be sure of the same if it becomes provocative — for example, if it pushes for independence.\n\n“The Taiwan Relations Act commits the United States to provide Taiwan with the arms that it needs to defend itself and to ensure that the United States can defend Taiwan in the event it chooses to do so,” Mazza said. “It does not commit the United States to intervene directly in a conflict to defend Taiwan.”\n\nMazza is not alone in endorsing strategic clarity with China and Taiwan, finding an unlikely ally in Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA).\n\n“The legal limitations on a president’s ability to respond quickly could all but ensure a Chinese fait accompli,” the House Foreign Affairs Committee vice chairwoman firstwrotelast fall in aWashington Postop-ed. “My Republican colleagues introduced the Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act in February to grant the president the authority to act against an invasion of Taiwan and prevent a fait accompli. This act is a good starting point to address a legal dilemma.”\n\nToday, I questioned@HASCDemocratswitnesses on the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan and our ability to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nWe must end the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity on Taiwan.pic.twitter.com/KC7ooHnC70\n\n— Rep. Elaine Luria (@RepElaineLuria)March 9, 2022\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Michael McCaul (R-TX) echoed Luria, though he conceded that the intelligence community would not appreciate it.\n\n“Having said that, I personally kind of like it because it does provide a deterrent message that we will defend Taiwan,” he said. “Coming from the president, it’s very strong.”\n\nThe Cato Institute’s defense policy studies director, Eric Gomez, disagreed, contending that strategic ambiguity endows the U.S. with “freedom of action” as it attempts to maintain peace and stability between China and Taiwan, particularly because Beijing already operates under an assumption that escalation is possible.\n\n“The risk of these repeated things that Biden is saying is that I think it emboldens the crowd in Washington who want to do away with strategic ambiguity entirely,” he said. “Do you open Pandora’s box?”\n\nChinacondemnedBiden telling reporters beside new Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida that “yes,” the U.S. has made “a commitment” to defend Taiwan militarily.\n\nQ: “Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?”\n\nPresident Biden: “Yes. It’s a commitment we made.”pic.twitter.com/2Lh3B7QVEX\n\n— CSPAN (@cspan)May 23, 2022\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin reminded the U.S. that Taiwan is “a purely internal affair for China.”\n\n“No one should underestimate the firm resolve, staunch will, and strong ability of the Chinese people in defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Wang said.\n\nThis is the third time the White House has had to distill Biden’s China-Taiwan policy. This time, senior administration officials told reporters the U.S. position “has not changed.”\n\n“He reiterated our One China Policy,” the source said. “He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself.”\n\nBiden had previously indicated that the U.S. would come to Taiwan’s aid if attacked during a town hall in Octob..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Economy And Jobs June Jobs Report Surpasses Expectations Adds 147000", "output": "Markets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nThe US job market continues to chug along despite heightened uncertainty about the economy and how President Donald Trump’s tariffs could shake out.\n\nThe economy added a stronger-than-expected 147,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.\n\nLast month’s gains, which landed aboveexpectations for 117,500 jobs to be added, marked a slight increase from May’s total, which was revised up slightly (5,000 jobs) to 144,000. April’s job gains were revised higher by 11,000 jobs, for a net gain of 158,000.\n\nThose revisions and Thursday’s data bring the three-month average job growth to 150,000.\n\nHowever, despite the continuation of fairly solid monthly employment gains, Thursday’s jobs report once again showed several potentially concerning signs, including some fissures that may be spreading under the weight of the Trump administration’s economy-shifting policies.\n\nNotably, job growth is not widespread, indicating that the biggest opportunities are within a select few industries.\n\nThe vast majority of the month’s gains were in health care (+58,600 jobs), leisure and hospitality (+20,000 jobs), and state and local government (+80,000 jobs*). [*The sharp increase here is likely “artificial,” economists for Pantheon Economics cautioned. More on that below.]\n\nAnd when stripping out the public sector gains (the +80,000 was offset slightly by a loss of 7,000 jobs federally), US private sector businesses added 74,000 jobs in June, the smallest monthly gain since October 2024.\n\n“The tariff tax hike, restrictive monetary policy and worries about a further intensification of the trade war are weighing heavily on labor demand,” Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in an investor note on Thursday. “Private payrolls excluding healthcare and education rose by just 23,000, well below the 50,000 average pace in the previous 12 months. Fundamentally, then, this is a weak report.”\n\nTombs noted that the mathematical adjustments made by the BLS to smooth out seasonal fluctuations (think: construction employment surging in the spring and retail ramping up hiring in advance of Christmas) may have made the overall numbers look a little more rosy. Education jobs typically fall in the summertime; however, the decrease was not as sharp this year, which the seasonal adjustment factor relayed as a strong gain.\n\nThe labor force participation rate ticked down, while the unemployment rate for Black workers surged by 0.8 percentage points to 6.8%, its highest rate since January 2022.\n\nThe household survey, one of two that feed into the monthly jobs report, often can have volatile monthly swings; however, rising unemployment levels for Black workers has in the past served as an indicator of impending economic weakness.\n\n“There has been this thought that when the economy slows, Black workers might feel the effects of that more quickly, because they might be in situations that have less job security,” Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor, told CNN in an interview. “But the timescale for that tends to be pretty short, and it is very dependent on which industries are impacted.”\n\nWorkers’ wages overall increased at a slower pace than economists expected. Average hourly earnings rose by 8 cents, or 0.2%, to $36.30 last month, bringing the annual rate to 3.7% from 3.9%.\n\nThe headline unemployment rate moving down to 4.1% also may be a function of a declining labor force, economists cautioned.\n\n“One gets the sense that the cumulative impact of tighter immigration policy is on the margin beginning to impact the size of the labor force and will impose a ceiling on any prospective increase in the unemployment rate as the economy slows,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM US, wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nStocks were higher Thursday: The Dow rose by 365 points, or 0.8% by mid-morning.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is caught between a hard place and an even harder one when it comes toimmigration.\n\nBiden embraced major progressive policy goals on the issue after he won the Democratic nomination, and he has begun enacting some. But his administration has been forced to confront unusuallyhigh numbersof migrants trying to enter the country along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the federal response has inflamed both critics and allies.\n\nMuch of the anger is centered on the administration’s immigration point person, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\n“Getting hit from both sides in the matter of immigration is no surprise,” Mayorkas said on NBC last weekend. “We are in the epicenter of the country’s divide, regrettably.”\n\nThe result is that immigration has become an early and unwanted distraction for an administration that wouldrather focuson the pandemic, the economy and other policy priorities.\n\nJust 35% of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of immigration, down from 43% in April, when it was already one of Biden’s worst issues, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Immigration is a relative low point for Biden within his own party with just 60% of Democrats saying they approve.\n\nImagesof Border Patrol agents on horseback blocking Haitian migrants from crossing the Rio Grande only added to the angst. While the widely shared photos incorrectly suggested that agents were using their reins to whip at mostly Black migrants, Mayorkas and Biden expressed outrage at the tactics and Homeland Security is investigating.\n\nThe outcry was such that Mayorkas was asked if his department was a “rogue agency.” He responded, “I couldn’t disagree more vehemently.”\n\nSome of Biden’s strongest supporters on Capitol Hill and among outside immigrant advocates had already been expressing outrage about the administration’s continued reliance on a Trump-era public health authority, known asTitle 42, to rapidly expel migrants, including thousands of Haitians.\n\nMarielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center and onetime co-chair of a task force on immigration meant touniteBiden supporters with more progressive primary backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders, noted that the White House “has appointed some of the best people in our movement” to help run immigration programs.\n\nBut she is among those opposed to Title 42, which the Trump administration invoked early in the pandemic, ostensibly to slow the spread of COVID-19. It prevents people from making claims for U.S. asylum.\n\n“This is the moment when friends need to have those courageous conversations with friends,” Hincapié said. “When they’re making the wrong decision.”\n\nThe administration’s refusal to halt Title 42 — even appealing a court order to stop relying on it to expel families — along with the lack of progress in Congress on a sweeping immigration bill that Biden introduced upon taking office has prompted supporters to warn of a return to the enforcement-heavy policies of President Barack Obama.\n\n“They’ve been there for eight months,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group backed by some of the nation’s la..."}

The former gymnast spent decades working her way up at the jeans company, eventually even being considered a possible candidate to become CEO. ThenCOVID-19happened. In a blog post, she wrote that she decided to leave the apparel maker after it pressured her to stop speaking about her opposition to school closures because of the pandemic.\n\nSey also said she turned down $1 million in severance because she feared it would come with a non-disclosure agreement that would prohibit her from talking about the reasons behind her departure.\n\n\"The money would be very nice. But I just can't do it,\" she said Monday in her blogpost, published on a Substack account run by conservative writer Bari Weiss.\n\nIn an email to CBS MoneyWatch, Levi's confirmed Sey's resignation. Chief Commercial Officer Seth Ellison will take on the responsibilities as brand president on an interim basis, while the company starts its search for someone to fill Sey's role. Levi's didn't respond to Sey's comments or allegations.\n\nThe resignation is the latest example of corporations caught in the crosshairs of opposing views on COVID-related policies, such as theboycott of Carhartt productssparked last month when its CEO said he was still mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for employees even after the Supreme Court ruled against the federal regulation. Sey said she wanted to speak out against school closures because of \"the harms caused by virtual learning.\"\n\nMore than 20 years ago I joined Levi’s. Yesterday I resigned my post as president so that I can use my voice.https://t.co/7UG6TCXqHU\n\nHer views drew criticism from several executives and departments at Levi's, she said, including its HR and legal departments. Sey added that she was told she was on track to become the company's next CEO, but that she had to \"stop talking about the school thing.\"\n\n\"In the last month, the CEO told me that it was 'untenable' for me to stay,\" Sey wrote.\n\nLevi's is \"trapped trying to please the mob — and silencing any dissent within the organization. In this it is like so many other American companies: held hostage by intolerant ideologues who do not believe in genuine inclusion or diversity,\" Sey wrote.\n\nSey, who has four children, said that she spoke out on school closures as a private citizen, not on behalf of Levi's. In her post, she said she moved her family from San Francisco, California, to Denver so that her kindergartner could attend school in person — a move that attracted both local andnational media attention.\n\nHer opinions drew both support and criticism from readers on social media.\n\n\"You are making a choice.  Most do not make enough for that luxury,\" one reader noted. \"But do you understand why schools closed? Sure, some risk to kids. But the key really is viruses often get into homes through schools more than kids are at risk.\"\n\n© 2022 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n(02:57)\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

(AP Photo/Al Behrman, File)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) —Louisianahas become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated Legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor.\n\nThe legislation that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in “large, easily readable font” in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\n“If you want to respect the rule of law, you’ve got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses” who got the commandments from God, Landry said.\n\nOpponents questioned the law’s constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the measure isnot solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are “foundational documents of our state and national government.”\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph “context statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of American publiceducationfor almost three centuries,” must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nStay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.\n\nThe law also “authorizes” but does not require the display of other items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is often referred to as America’s “First Constitution\"; the Declaration of Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a government in the Northwest Territory — in the present day Midwest — and created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union.\n\nNot long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised to file a lawsuit challenging it.\n\nThe law prevents students from getting an equal education and will keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school, the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\n“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking sides in this theological debate,” the groups said.\n\nThe controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states includingTexas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has succeeded in making the bills law.\n\nLegal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms are not new.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed.\n\n___\n\nThe story has been corrected to clarify that the time for gubernatorial action did not lapse.

Social media accounts that appear to have belonged to Shiffer, accounts that were wiped or suspended on Thursday, contained posts about saving ammunition and expressing a desire to harm the FBI.\n\nThe suspect was shot and killed by officers after he raised his weapon at law enforcement following unsuccessful negotiation tactics, police said,according toNewsNation’s Evan Lambert.\n\nNorthbound Interstate 71 was shut down after the suspect fired a nail gun at law enforcement, held up an AR-style rifle, and drove away from the Cincinnati field office’s visitor screening facility on Thursday,a local NBC affiliate reported.\n\nPolice said the man was followed by highway patrol, and police said the suspect got off the highway and stopped before the suspect and law enforcement exchanged gunfire in what turned into a standoff, according to the report.\n\nOhio State Police spokesman Lt. Nathan Dennis said the suspect was wearing body armor and was pronounced dead on the scene. An investigation into the motive of the suspect is still ongoing,accordingto NBC News. No officers were injured in the exchange.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nShiffer was seen in photos taken the day of the Capitol riot, law enforcementofficials told NBC News. However, it is unclear whether he breached the building, and it does not appear as though he was charged in connection with the riot.\n\nShiffer appears to have posted on such social media apps as Truth Social and Twitter. The last post on his Truth Social account looks to have been sent after the attempted breach of the FBI building.\n\n“Well, I thought I had a way through bullet proof glass, and I didn’t. If you don’t hear from me, it is true I tried attacking the F.B.I., and it’ll mean either I was taken off the internet, the F.B.I. got me, or they sent the regular cops while,” the post said.\n\nThe Truth Social account, which has since been wiped, had a bio that read: “I am a construction electrician in Columbus. I have had accounts blocked, locked, or deleted by ThemTube, Twitter, and, believe it or not, Rumble. On the fifth I tried to explain to Epps that it would only make sense to go into the building if they approved the fraudulent votes. (He of course went back to yelling ‘we have to go IN to to the Capitol.’. I, unfortunately wrote him off as a dumbass.).”\n\nTheWashington Examineralso took screenshots of some posts to a Twitter account suspected of belonging to Shiffer that has since been suspended. There, he also spoke of violence against the FBI and collecting ammunition. Posts also contained references to the American Revolution and talk of getting in touch with the far-right Proud Boys group.\n\nThe attack on the building in Cincinnati comes a few days after the FBI raided former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which was followed by arise in calls to arms and threatsagainst the bureau. The search was reportedly part of an investigation into documents at the private club, some of which may have contained classified information.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garlanddelivered a statementto reporters Thursday about the raid and announced that the Justice Department requested permission from a federal court to unseal the court-approved search warrant that authorized the bureau’s search of the former president’s Florida residence.\n\nDuring his remarks, Garland said he could not “stand by silently when their integrity is unfairly attacked. The men and women of the FBI and the Justice Department are dedicated, patriotic public servants.”\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray also released a statement Thursday condemning smears, threats, and violence against law enforcement, including those against the bureau.\n\n“Unfounded attacks on the integrity of the FBI erode respect for the rule of law and are a grave disservice to the men and women who sacrifice so much to protect others,” Wray said. “Violence and threats against law enforcement, including the FBI, are dangerous and should be deeply concerning to all Americans.

Scott Applewhite\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce this week whether she will create a new committee to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, weeks after Republicans blocked a bipartisan probe under pressure from former President Donald Trump.\n\nPelosi’s office clarified Tuesday night that she had not formally announced plans to form that committee, capping an hour of confusion after reports surfaced that she had done so at a closed-door meeting earlier that night. In that discussion, Pelosi seemed to suggest that she would move forward with creating the committee, according to a source in the room.\n\nThe speaker did not say exactly when she would formally announce her plans. A growing number of Democrats have been pushing for a select committee, which could take on the investigative work of the Sept. 11-style commission that Republicans rejected last month.\n\nThe caucus has been debating for weeks whether to launch a separate probe when several House committees, including the Homeland Security Committee, are already leading their own investigations into the violent riot.\n\nIf the speaker does opt for a select committee, they can consolidate their investigations into a single body but run the risk of being perceived as partisan. Republicans created a select committee to investigate the 2012 attacks in the Libyan city of Benghazi, for example, but the panel drew criticism from Democrats.\n\nSome Democrats have also privately feared that a party-line probe could further fuel tensions across the aisle, with a small but vocal faction of the GOP downplaying the violence of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n“If Jim Jordan were in charge, it would be just like the Benghazi investigation. Luckily, he’s not in charge,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who led the impeachment charge against Trump for inciting that insurrection in January.\n\nPOLITICO’s Rachael Bade reports on why the decades-old debate over the Senate procedure requiring 60 votes for most legislation to pass is coming to a head.\n\nThe House passed legislation last month to establish a bipartisan commission, but Senate Republicans blocked the bill, arguing existing committee-led and federal investigations made the commission “extraneous.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he could bring the legislation up for another vote, but Pelosi’s announcement would appear to table any plans to force another vote.\n\nTwo Senate committees released their own bipartisan report on Jan. 6 security failures earlier this month, but Democrats took pains to say their reports were not a substitute for a broader investigation into the insurrection. The Senate committees’ reports only examined security, preparation and response to the attack rather than addressing bigger themes like the White House’s actions during the insurrection.\n\nCLARIFICATION:This story was updated to reflect Pelosi’s decision-making from an earlier edition that cited sourcing which indicated she had announced that she decided to create the committee.\n\nLoading\n\nYou will now start receiving email updates\n\nPlease check your inbox for a confirmation email\n\nYou are already subscribed\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nYour first read on Capitol Hill politics and policy.\n\nBy signing up, you acknowledge and agree to ourPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Service.

According to areport, the Menlo Park, California-based firm informed founders funded through its Talent X Opportunity fund and program that the program will pause for an undetermined period while the firm refines its process. As a result, three workers on the TxO team were let go.\n\nThe fintech sector saw another startup on the road to calling it quits with West Palm Beach, Florida-basedMyBambu, an online bank and financial services app designed primarily to serve underserved and immigrant communities. Per areport, the company, which was founded in 2016, laid off 100 workers on Oct. 31, with the remaining 41 employees scheduled to be let go by the end of the year, at which time the office will close permanently.\n\nAnother total shutdown wasreportedthis week when San Francisco-based tech-driven hospitality companySondersaid it is in the process of winding down as a result of the sudden termination of its agreement withMarriott International. While it’s not clear exactly what caused the parting of the ways, Sonder says its plans also include filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, affecting both its U.S. and global operations.\n\nSpring, Texas-based enterprise software companyHewlett Packard Enterprisejoins the tracker again, just eight months after trimming 2,500 workers in March. This time around the number of people affected is smaller, with 52 employees in its San Jose, California, office seeing their roles cut, with the initial layoff taking place in mid-October and concluding in mid-November.\n\nThe following companies were added to the tracker this week:\n\nLayoffs during the week ended Nov. 12, 2025:At least296U.S. tech sector employees were laid off or scheduled for layoffs, per a Crunchbase News tally.\n\nIn 2025:Around100,819workers have been let go from U.S.-based tech companies so far according to our tally.\n\nIn 2024:At least95,667workers at U.S.-based tech companies lost their jobs in 2024, according to a Crunchbase News tally.\n\nIn 2023:More than191,000workers in U.S.-based tech companies (or tech companies with a large U.S. workforce) were laid off in mass job cuts.\n\nIn 2022:More than93,000jobs were slashed from public and private tech companies in the U.S.\n\nThis tracker includes layoffs conducted by U.S.-based companies or those with a strong U.S. presence and is updated at least bi-weekly.

We’ve also included companies based elsewhere that have a sizable team in the United States, such asKlarna, even when it’s unclear how much of the U.S. workforce has been affected by layoffs.\n\nLayoff and workforce figures are best estimates based on reporting. We source the layoffs from media reports, our own reporting, social media posts andlayoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced database of tech layoffs.\n\nWe recently updated our layoffs tracker to reflect the most recent round of layoffs each company has conducted. This allows us to quickly and more accurately track layoff trends, which is why you might notice some changes in our most recent numbers.\n\nIf an employee headcount cannot be confirmed to our standards, we note it as “unclear.”\n\nA layoff can be either a permanent termination of someone’s employment — usually for cost-saving reasons — or a temporary one because there’s not enough work to justify a full workforce. Tech company layoffs generally fall into the permanent category.\n\nA mass layoff is when a significant number of a company’s employees are cut in a short period of time, often as a result of economic conditions.\n\nTech layoffs started to surge in 2022 and continued in 2023 and 2024. Companies have given various reasons for conducting layoffs.\n\nSome companies — especially those in the e-commerce sector — nearly doubled their employee headcount to meet consumer demand during the COVID-19 pandemic’s stay-at-home mandates, and later found that they were overstaffed as daily life returned to normal.\n\nLarge tech employers such asSalesforceandGoogleparentAlphabetnoted that their post-pandemic layoffs followed several years of rapid hiring fueled by fast growth — between 2019 and 2022, some companies nearly doubled their employee headcount. Some large tech companies also cited slowing sales and fears of a recession as reasons for downsizing.\n\nVenture-backed startups, meanwhile, also cut jobs as a way to cut costs and preserve their cash reserves, as venture fundingfell significantlyafter the peak in 2021. Some startups that ran out of cash and couldn’t raise new funding found themselves filing for bankruptcy or shutting down.\n\nIntel Corp.laid off the largest number of people among U.S. tech employers in 2024, by our count.

Intermittent rain fell in the earthquake-damaged city of Les Cayes and in the capital of Port-au-Prince.\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, the Civil Protection Agency raised the death toll to 1,941 and the number of injured to 9,900, many of whom have had to wait for medical help lying outside in wilting heat.\n\nThe devastation is centered in the country’s southwestern area, where health care has reached capacity and people have lost homes and loved ones.\n\nPatience was running out in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation.

We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what’s happening and why it matters.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism.Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBaby bonds, explained.\n\nAmerica has a massive, growing racial wealth gap. The median white family today holds nearly10 times the wealthof the median black family.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap. His idea is to give lower-income kids a sizable nest egg (nearly $50,000 in some cases) that they could use for wealth-building purchases, like a down payment on a house or college tuition.\n\nThese “opportunity accounts” would, theoretically, make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood, rather than just those who grow up in wealthier homes.\n\n“It would be a dramatic change in our country to have low-income people break out of generational poverty,” Booker said in an interview with Vox. “We could rapidly bring security into those families’ lives, and that is really exciting to me.”\n\nSimilar ideas have swirled aroundthink tankssince the early 2000s, but Booker appears to be the first high-profile senator to introduce legislation to create such a program. As possible 2020 presidential nominees like Booker begin to unveil ambitious policy ideas — like Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-VT) Medicare-for-all plan or Kamala Harris’s (D-CA) newcash assistanceplan — Booker appears ready to focus on racial inequality in America, and how to solve it.\n\nAmerica’s wealth gap grew rapidly through the late 20th century. In 1963, families at the top of America’s wealth distribution had six times the wealth of those in the middle. By 2012, the wealthiest had12 timesthe assets of middle-income families.\n\nSpecific government policies have driven the racial gap by making it specifically harder for minorities to accrue wealth. The decades-long practice of the Federal Housing Authorityrefuse to underwrite housing loansto many black families, for example, made it difficult for those families to pass on the earnings of real estate to their children the way a white family might.\n\nBooker notes that his own parents, who are African American, essentially had to pose as a white couple to purchase a house in a predominantly white neighborhood in 1969. They had a white couple put in the offer on the house, but Booker’s parents then showed up to the closing. (Booker recounts this story in greater detail inan episode of Vox’s show on Netflix,Explained).\n\n“I know the difference it meant for my family to be able to buy that house and accrue that wealth,” he says. “I know the Herculean things they had to do to get into that neighborhood.”\n\nBooker’s proposal is meant to target young children who haven’t benefited from the type of situation he did.\n\nHis American Opportunity Accounts Act would give each child born in the United States a savings account with $1,000. Each year, until the child turns 18, the government would deposit as much as $2,000 into that account. The size of the annual payments would depend on the child’s family income, with lower-income families receiving larger checks.\n\nThese accounts would be off limits until the child turns at 18, at which point the child could use them for specific “asset-building” purchases, like a down payment on a house, for example, or college tuition. (Booker hasn’t come up with a full list of eligible purchases yet.)\n\nBooker’s office estimates that a child who remains in the lowest income bracket of the program (meaning she gets the largest, $2,000 payments each year) would accrue $46,215 by her 18th birthday. A child in the highest income bracket of the program (above 500 percent of the poverty line, or $147,100 for a family of four) would end up with $1,681 — just the original $1,000 payment plus earnings accrued from the government investing it in low-risk funds.\n\nThey also project that the benefits of the program would go largely to minority children. Their figures suggest that the average black child will accrue $29,038 in her account and the average Latino child would get to $27,337. The average white child would end up with about half that ($15,790).\n\nBooker’s proposal looks largelysimilar to ideasthat have been floated by Darrick Hamilton of the New School and William Darity of Duke University. They presented a version of their “baby bond” program at the most recent meeting of the American Economics Association.\n\nOne of the things that struck me about Booker’s proposal is that it’s a much more aggressive and sweeping version of what Hillary Clintonproposedin her 2008 presidential run: a lump sum of $5,000 given to every child born in the United States that could be used to pay for college or a down payment in the future.\n\nBooker’s version is a much bigger program, and one with different goals: not just making college and housing affordable, but making colle..."}

This didn’t seem at all controversial to me. I felt—and still do—that the draconian policies would cause the most harm to those least at risk, and the burden would fall heaviest on disadvantaged kids in public schools, who need the safety and routine of school the most,” Sey wrote.\n\nHer advocacy earned her accusations of being a “racist—a strange accusation given that I have two black sons—a eugenicist, and a QAnon conspiracy theorist,” she wrote. According to Sey, her outspoken activism, which could be found in columns, television appearances, and on her social media feeds, eventually earned her rebukes from her bosses, as well as Levi’s human resources and legal departments.\n\nSey said her treatment revealed what appeared to be a double-standard at the clothing company. “Meantime, colleagues posted nonstop about the need to oust Trump in the November election. I also shared my support for Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary and my great sadness about the racially instigated murders of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. No one at the company objected to any of that,” she wrote.\n\nSey said she continued to fight COVID-19 lockdown policies and eventually moved her family out of California to Denver so that her kindergartener could attend school in-person. The move allegedly precipitated her downfall in the company. She wrote:\n\nNational media picked up on ourstory, and I was asked to go on Laura Ingraham’s show on Fox News. That appearance was the last straw. The comments from Levi’s employees picked up—about me being anti-science; about me being anti-fat (I’d retweeted a study showing a correlation between obesity and poor health outcomes); about me being anti-trans (I’d tweeted that we shouldn’t ditch Mother’s Day for Birthing People’s Day because it left out adoptive and step moms); and about me being racist, because San Francisco’s public school system was filled with black and brown kids, and, apparently, I didn’t care if they died. They also castigated me for my husband’s Covid views—as if I, as his wife, were responsible for the things he said on social media.\n\nAll this drama took place at our regular town halls—a companywide meeting I had looked forward to but now dreaded.\n\nIn a meeting with CEO Charles Bergh in the fall of 2021, Sey said that Bergh told her she was on track to become CEO of the clothing company. “The only thing standing in my way, he said, was me. All I had to do was stop talking about the school thing.”\n\nSey refused, opting to continue her activism. In a meeting earlier this year, Bergh spoke with her again and allegedly said that her presence at the company had grown “untenable.”\n\n“I was offered a $1 million severance package, but I knew I’d have to sign a nondisclosure agreement about why I’d been pushed out. The money would be very nice. But I just can’t do it. Sorry, Levi’s,” Sey wrote.\n\n“In my more than two decades at the company, I took my role as manager most seriously. I helped mentor and guide promising young employees who went on to become executives. In the end, no one stood with me. Not one person publicly said they agreed with me, or even that they didn’t agree with me, but supported my right to say what I believe anyway,” she concluded. “I like to think that many of my now-former colleagues know that this is wrong. I like to think that they stayed silent because they feared losing their standing at work or incurring the wrath of the mob. I hope, in time, they’ll acknowledge as much.”\n\nThe Daily Wire’s first original film, Shut In, has made its cinematic debut, being met with rave reviews.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Culture Cambridge Dictionary Updates Its Definitions Man And Woman", "output": "The Cambridge Dictionary recently updated its entries for “man” and “woman” to include transgender people – the latest dictionary to broaden its lexicon to reflectevolving languagearound gender.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cambridge Dictionary told CNN that the updates went into effect in October. But the move seemed to go largely unnoticed until this week, when the dictionary’s expanded definition of “woman” garnered backlash from conservative commentators on social media and was subsequently covered by right-leaning media outlets.\n\nWhile the Cambridge Dictionary’s primary definition for “woman” remains “an adult female human being,” a second definition refers to “an adult who lives and identifies as female though they may have been said to have a different sex at birth.” Similarly, the British reference guide defines “man” as “an adult male human being” and also “an adult who lives and identifies as male though they may have been said to have a different sex at birth.”\n\nExample sentences provided by the dictionary include “Mary is a woman who was assigned male at birth” and “Their doctor encouraged them to live as a man for a while before undergoing surgical transition.”\n\n“(Our editors) carefully studied usage patterns of the word woman and concluded that this definition is one that learners of English should be aware of to support their understanding of how the language is used,” a Cambridge Dictionary spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “The first definition at the entry for woman remains unchanged and continues to be ‘an adult female human being’.”\n\nThe definition of “woman” has become yet another frontier in the culture wars in recent years. Earlier this week, Scotland’s highest courtdismisseda legal challenge brought by the group For Women Scotland, who argued that trans women shouldn’t be included in the definition of “women” under a law aimed at improving the gender balance on public boards. In the US, Republican politicians have repeatedlyevokedthe definition of “woman” in their attacks on transgender people.\n\nEarlier this week, Dictionary.com announced “woman” as its2022 word of the year, citing how “the very matter of the definition of the word ‘woman’ was at the center of so many consequential moments, discussions, and decisions in our society.”\n\nDespite the outcry deeming Cambridge Dictionary’s new definitions to be a political statement, the spokesperson said that such changes are meant to provide an accurate depiction of how certain words are used in society.\n\n“Our dictionaries are written for learners of English and are designed to help users understand English as it is currently used,” the statement read. “They are compiled by analysing a large corpus of English texts (over 2 billion words in total) taken from all areas of writing and publishing, which allows us to see exactly how language is used. We regularly update our dictionary to reflect changes in how English is used, based on analysis of data from this corpus.”\n\nOther dictionaries have made similar changes to terms around gender and gender identity over the years.\n\nIn 2020, Merriam-Websterexpandedits definition of “female” to include “having a gender identity that is the opposite of male” – that change also drew criticism from conservatives, though a similar addition was made to the word “male.” The year before, Merriam-Websteradded a new definition to the pronoun “they”to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Two can play that game!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nBogging down the Trump administration with burdensome document requests and subpoenas could indeed backfire, political analysts tell Fox News, but there is little doubt that the strategy -- made more viable by heightened partisanship and loosened congressional norms -- would impair Republicans' messaging and even policy goals for the next two years.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who aims to reclaim the position of House speaker when her colleagues vote on leadership roles in the coming weeks, recently seemed to threaten to use congressional subpoenas as a cudgel against the White House.\n\n“Subpoena power is interesting, to use it or not to use it,” Pelosi said at a conference in October, referring to the authority of House committees to summon individuals and organizations to testify or provide documents under penalty of perjury. “It is a great arrow to have in your quiver in terms of negotiating on other subjects.\" She added that she would use the power \"strategically.\" (Trump has flatly called Pelosi's plan \"illegal.\")\n\nDEMS RETAKE HOUSE, BUT GOP EXPANDS SENATE MAJORITY -- GIVING THEM CONTROL OVER JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS\n\nOn Tuesday night, as it became clear Democrats would retake the House, Pelosi appeared to double down on that rhetoric, declaring that the midterms were about “restoring the Constitution’s checks and balances to the Trump administration.\"\n\n\"In sharp contrast to the GOP Congress, a Democratic Congress will be led with transparency and openness, so the public can see what's happening and how it affects them. ... We will have accountability,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"A Democratic Congress will be led with transparency and openness.\"\n\nPelosi has said that unearthing Trump's personal tax returns would be \"one of the first things we'd do\" in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, calling it the \"easiest thing in the world\" to obtain them using statutory authority granted to congressional committees under the Internal Revenue Service code. Democrats made several efforts to obtain Trump's returns while in the minority, only to be rejected by House Republicans.\n\nTrump would likely seek to stall those requests with legal challenges, and it remains unclear whether Democrats could publicly release his tax returns even if they obtained them for investigative purposes.\n\nBefore a rally in Indiana on Monday, Trump brushed off the threat. \"I don't care,\" he said. \"They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want.\"\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, the Democrat who was projected to win New York's 10th congressional district, warned Trump in atweethis administration would be \"held accountable.\"\n\n\"Tonight, the American people have demanded accountability from their government and sent a clear message of what they want from Congress,\" he wrote. Trump \"may not like it, but he and his administration will be held accountable to our laws and to the American people.\"\n\nHouse committees can effectively hold in statutory contempt anyone who refuses to fully comply with a subpoena relevant to the committee's legislative purpose and pertinent to its investigation.

Some of them were reported to be in tears.\n\nShe is understood to have promised not to call a \"snap general election\" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year's election, when she lost her majority.\n\nBut, she added: \"I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election.\"\n\nCabinet minister Amber Rudd said \"she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022\".\n\nBut Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a \"half-hearted\" reception from MPs.\n\nShe had said it was not her \"intention\" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a \"politician's word\".\n\nMarcus Fysh, who also submitted a no confidence letter, said Mrs May \"didn't really have anything new to say\" about Brexit.\n\nShe vowed to involve more people in developing policy, the MP told BBC News, but he did not think that would happen.\n\nAnd he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs - not just Conservative ones - when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons.\n\n\"Whatever happens tonight I don't think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue.\"\n\nMinister Margot James said she was \"proud\" to have voted for the PM, tweeting a picture of her ballot paper.\n\nConservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months.\n\nThat takes one uncertainty off the table.

The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won't give their backing.\n\nRead Laura's blog\n\nImmediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was \"the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29\", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would \"flush out the extremists\" in his party whose Brexit agenda was \"not in the interests of the British people\".\n\nSo far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research. She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive.\n\nIf Mrs May wins the confidence vote she cannot be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year.\n\nIf she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand.\n\nIf Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand.\n\nIn her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning, Mrs May said: \"A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic.\n\n\"Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest.\"\n\nShe said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to  \"deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead\".\n\nThe Conservatives had to build a \"country that works for everyone\" and deliver \"the Brexit people voted for\".\n\n\"I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job.\"\n\nNot immediately. She would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new Conservative leader is selected by the party, a process that could take up to six weeks.\n\nIf there are multiple candidates, Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members.\n\nAs leader of the largest party in the Commons, the new Conservative le..."}

Twitter, claiming the story violated its terms of service on hacked materials,locked theNew York Post out of its account for weeks and even blocked users from sharing the story link.\n\nFormer New York Post deputy politics editor Emma-Jo Morris, who had the lead byline on the initialbombshell report, said she didn’t need a laptop to be confirmed by the FBI or mainstream outlets to feel vindicated.\n\nFLASHBACK: MSNBC, CNN, CBS TOLD VIEWERS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY WAS RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION\n\n\"I thought it was insane, and almost beyond parody what I was watching, as the entire political establishment, intelligence community, media establishment, big tech, everyone just made up a story that I knew wasn't true,\" Morris, now at Breitbart News, toldFox News Digital.\n\n\"It's kind of funny now to watch them all have to walk back this kind of crazy, outrageous claim that they had all made,\" she continued. \"But I was vindicated the minute we pressed publish.\"\n\nThe legacy media downplayed or ignored the New York Post's bombshell reporting on the infamous Hunter Biden laptop in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election.(Getty images  |  New York Post)\n\nIn one of the most memorable media conversations regarding the bombshell story, Trump appeared on CBS’ \"60 Minutes\" shortly after the story emerged and called the laptop \"one of the biggest scandals\" he had ever seen. But interviewer Lesley Stahl was insistent that there was no way to conclude the laptop or its contents were real.\n\n\"Excuse me, they found the laptop. Lesley. Listen,\" Trump said, as Stahl repeatedly interjected that the laptop could not be verified.\n\n\"What can’t be verified?\" Trump asked.\n\n\"The laptop!\" Stahl exclaimed.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" Trump responded, before further arguing the laptop had to be legitimate.\n\nStahl’s employer, CBS News, confirmed in 2022 via its own forensic investigation that the laptop and its contents were legitimate. The admission prompted many Trump allies to vilify Stahl, and Hunter Biden’s trial has reignited criticism of the veteran journalist.\n\n\"Stahl owes Trump an apology,\" Townhall senior editor Matt Vespawrote Thursday.\n\nCBS News did not immediately respond to a series of questions, including whether Stahl plans to apologize.\n\nVeteran CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl famously said the Hunter Biden laptop couldn't be verified during her \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-President Trump.(Screenshot/CBS News)\n\nStahl’s dismissal is perhaps the most memorable, but she is far from the only journalist who cast aspersions on the laptop during an astonishing display of media-tech coordination.\n\nSymone Sanders-Townsend appeared on MSNBC as a Biden spokeswoman that month and bluntly stated that any attempts by then-President Trump to amplify the story would be viewed as \"Russian misinformation.\" She now hosts a show on the network.\n\nMSNBC contributor Jason Johnson said, \"It is so obviously a Russian operation,\" when asked about the laptop. \"Deadline: White House\" host Nicolle Wallace was more confident in dismissing Hunter Biden's laptop, telling viewers, \"We shouldn't look at it as anything other than a Russian disinformation operation.\" MSNBC anchor Katy Tur mocked the Post's story, saying it \"dropped like a bomb\" but then withered under scrutiny.\n\nMSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle attacked those who were covering the Hunter Biden controversy, referring to it as a \"so-called story\" with \"unverified claims.\"\n\nCNN BOSS, POLITICAL DIRECTOR SPIKED HUNTER BIDEN CONTROVERSY, AUDIOTAPES REVEAL: 'WE'RE NOT GOING WITH' STORY\n\nCNN was caught spiking the laptop story when it first broke, according to recordings obtained by Project Veritas that were released in December 2020.\n\n\"Obviously, we're not going with the New York Post story right now on Hunter Biden,\" CNN political director David Chalian said during a co..."}

Regan said in a statement.\n\nRelated article'I'm kind of speechless': Democrats scramble to salvage climate provisions after Manchin sinks Build Back Better\n\nThe 2023-2026 model year emissions standards will increase by between 5-10% each year, getting to 40 miles per gallon on a 2026 model year vehicle’s emissions sticker – what consumers see on a new car. The new 40 miles per gallon standard is a slight increase from the 38.2 mpg for 2026 vehicles that theEPA first proposed in August.\n\nUAW President Ray Curry praised the new rules, calling it a “win-win for UAW members, the U.S. manufacturing workforce and our environment.”\n\n“Well thought out regulations, such as the Biden Administration’s emission rules today, will promote long-term U.S. investments while they protect and expand good paying union jobs in vehicle production and advanced technologies that will allow manufacturers the flexibility necessary to meet these standards,” Curry said.\n\nThe lowerTrump-era emissions standards, known as SAFE standards, were a rollback of Obama administration rules on cars and would have only increased to just 32 mpg in mileage year 2026. The new standards are also an increase from the Obama EPA’s rules, which would have gotten cars and trucks to 36 mpg.\n\nThe rule will be published in the Federal Register by the end of the year and will go into effect 60 days after. The EPA is also starting to work on tighter fuel standards for mileage year 2027 and beyond.\n\n“We went backwards under President Trump and we lost a lot of momentum,” said Margo Oge, Chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation, and a former Obama EPA official who helped draft that administration’s emissions rules. “These standards will bring the country ahead again but we have so much more work to do.”\n\nAccording to an agency fact sheet, the new standards will prevent 3.1 billion tons of planet-warming CO2 emissions from being pumped into the atmosphere, reduce US gasoline consumption by 360 billion gallons and save US consumers money at the pump.\n\nRelated articleA rush to mine lithium in Nevada is pitting climate advocates and environmental groups against each other\n\nThe EPA also said the new rule would help shift the US car market towards electric vehicles, which currently make up a miniscule portion of the cars Americans drive. Electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids accounted for just 2% of US vehicle production in 2020, according to an EPA estimate. The agency said the new final rule could get EVs to a 17% market share by mileage year 2026.\n\nJohn Bozzella, President and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said in a statement that the organization is “committed to achieving a cleaner, safer, and smarter future,” but that collaboration between the industry and government will be necessary to meet the new standards.\n\n“Achieving the goals of this final rule will undoubtedly require enactment of supportive governmental policies – including consumer incentives, substantial infrastructure growth, fleet requirements, and support for U.S. manufacturing and supply chain development,” Bozzella said.\n\nIncreasing fuel mileage standards is an important piece of President Joe Biden’s overall climate agenda. Transportation emissions account for nearly 30% of overall US greenhouse gas emissions – the largest portion of the total.\n\nThe new rules go hand-in-hand with Biden’s ambition to transition to zero-emissions vehicles, and “will unlock literally hundreds of billions in fuel savings for American consumers,” Ali Zaidi, Deputy National Climate Advisor, said in a statement. “It’s part of a broader win-win playbook for our consumers, workers, and environment.”\n\nIn August, Biden announced a goal that half the vehicles sold in the US by 2030 would be battery electric, fuel-cell electric or plug-in hybrid. That goal hit a roadblock this weekend, as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin announced he was opposed to Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which contains a proposed $320 billion for clean energy and electric vehicle tax credits.\n\nDan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Di..."}

Just eight percent said the U.S. is safer as a result of the Afghanistan exit.\n\nBiden touted his foreign policy prowess and his competence in running an administration as he challenged formerPresident Trumpin the 2020 election.

He will continue to serve as executive chair and chief executive officer of Fox Corp,Fox NewsCorp said. Rupert Murdoch, 92, will serve as chairman emeritus.\n\nHis oldest son Lachlan Murdoch, 52, has served with his father as co-chairman of News Corp since 2014 and as chairman and CEO of Fox Corp since its incorporation in 2019.\n\n“We thank him for his vision, his pioneering spirit, his steadfast determination, and the enduring legacy he leaves to the companies he founded and countless people he has impacted,” Lachlan Murdoch said in a statement. “We are grateful that he will serve as Chairman Emeritus and know he will continue to provide valued counsel to both companies.”\n\nRupert Murdoch, who was born in Australia but is now a U.S. citizen, also announced his decision in a letter to colleagues on Thursday. In addition to expressing gratitude, he said that he is in good health and plans to stay professionally active.\n\n“We have every reason to be optimistic about the coming years - I certainly am, and plan to be here to participate in them,” he wrote,according to Fox News.“In my new role, I can guarantee you that I will be involved every day in the contest of ideas.”\n\nFox Corp’s brands include Fox News Media, Fox Sports, Fox Entertainment, Fox Television Stations and Tubi Media Group. News Corps is composed of media businesses that primarily operate in the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nLachlan Murdoch’s takeover of the companies has been expected since 2019, though it wasn’t always certain, leading to internal family drama thatinspired the Emmy-winningHBO drama, “Succession.”\n\nHis younger brother James Murdoch, 50, was for a time considered a potential successor to his father.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Amazon Cut Bonuses And Stock Incentives After Raising Minimum Wage", "output": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nAmazon’s decision to raise workers’ minimum wage to $15 per hour was welcome news, even Sen. Bernie Sanderspraised the move.\n\nBut for some Amazon employees, the excitement didn’t last very long as they learned that existing financial incentives and bonus programs, including stock and monthly bonuses, that usually boost paychecks will be eliminated starting November 1.\n\nSeveral Amazon warehouse workers in the U.S., who spoke to Yahoo Finance on the condition of anonymity fearing reprisals, talked about how the change will negatively affect them. After the removal of these perks, some workers said they will be making less. Most of the workers who voiced concerns have been working for the company for more than two years, and have been earning close to $15 an hour before the raise.\n\nWhile these workers’ hourly rates will rise modestly, they said they could lose thousands of dollars that they would have collected from the stock and monthly-bonus programs. Amazon said those who are already making $15 an hour will see an increase in pay but did not specify how much.\n\nAn employee earning $15.25 an hour who has worked for Amazon for more than three years in Arizona crunched the numbers. Although he is getting a $1 an hour raise, which would equate to as much as $2,080 in additional pay a year, he said he could have earned a few thousands of dollars more from the incentive programs. “Amazon isn’t giving its employees a raise, they’re taking money from us,” he told Yahoo Finance. “It only looks good if folks don’t know the truth.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said “all hourly operations and customer service employees will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement. In addition, because it’s no longer incentive-based, the compensation will be more immediate and predictable.”\n\nIn the past, Amazon had used stock options as a major selling point during the recruiting process. “One of the ways we foster ownership among employees is through Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) awards. RSUs are a key part of our global compensation program, which has been carefully designed to help us attract, motivate and retain employees of the highest caliber,” according to an Amazon brochure about the program.\n\nUnder RSUs, full-time warehouse workers usually receive two or three shares each year after a two-year vesting period. Amazon stock (AMZN) has been on a bull run — the share price has more than tripled since 2016 and now is around $2,000. Amazon said it’ll replace RSU with a “direct stock purchase plan” but didn’t offer any specifics.\n\nAnother major perk that Amazon is phasing out is employee’s monthly bonuses, called Variable Compensation Pay (VCP). An employee can earn up to 8% of their monthly income, but it depends on how many hours they work and the facility site’s production goals. An average worker usually receives $1,800 to $3,000 a year through the VCP program, according to employees who talked to Yahoo Finance. Some said it’s especially frustrating to see the program removed now, since VCP doubles during peak months in the holiday season.\n\nAmazon said its decision to eliminate the financial incentive program was based on employees’ feedback. “We’ve heard from our hourly fulfillment and customer service employees that they prefer the predictability and immediacy of cash to RSUs,” the company wrote in a blog post. “The net effect of this change and the new higher cash compensation is significantly more total compensation for employees, without any vesting requirements, and with more predictability.”\n\nThe Amazon spokesperson also said, “The significant increase in hourly cash wages more than compensates for the phase out of incentive pay and RSUs.”\n\nThe decision was widely cheered by new employees who will immediately see a significant increase in their paycheck. Amazon posted avideoon the company’s YouTube page featuring employees’ excitement and appreciation.\n\nWhile the minimum wage increase will also apply to Whole Foods Market workers, it’s unclear how the change will impact its stock option plan, which the company recently announced inresponse to some employees calling for unionization. Last month, in a letter to employees, CEO John Mackey said Whole Foods will create an Amazon equity program for all employees with at least 6,000 service hours.\n\nDo you work for Amazon/Whole Foods?

Without it, tens of millions of American students would have been without formal instruction during the pandemic. It’s a big topic moving forward as we think about what schools will look like come September.\n\nA few policymakers are big fans. Take, for example, Eric Adams, one of the front-runners in the race to become New York City’s newest mayor. This February, the former policeman opined at a meeting of the Citizens Budget Commission, “If you do a full-year school year by using the new technology of remote learning, you don’t need children to be in a school building with a number of teachers. It’s just the opposite. You could have one great teacher that’s in one of our specialized high schools to teach three to 400 students.”\n\nBut Adams and those who share his view are pushing upstream against a growing consensus that remote learning contributes to “learning loss” and to teacher burnout, while being detrimental to student learning. Increasingly, school districts, as well as state leaders and elected officials, lean toward eliminating remote learning as an educational option for students come September—the current New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, among them.\n\nExtreme pro- and anti-positions are misbegotten. Advocates need to take care. Ham-fisted mandates banning or requiring remote learning are likely to throw the baby out with the bath water.\n\nThis entire discussion lacks the proper consideration of the overall benefits and drawbacks of remote learning.\n\nRemote learning has been used in educational settings for many years. There are traditional and virtual schools across the country that do amazing work with their students in fully virtual and hybrid settings. There are also, to be clear, fly-by-night e-operators consuming public dollars with very little public benefit to show for it.\n\nBut why are people so interested in removing or banning remote learning from the options we can offer students? Like so many things these days, remote learning feels like a politically charged topic. That’s an unfortunate reality given the benefits that some students find in remote settings.\n\nWithout remote learning this past year, schooling options for students in Joliet Public Schools District 86—which I lead—would have been embarrassingly threadbare. We were largely fully remote for most of the year. We were not fully one-to-one with our devices when the pandemic first shut down schools in March 2020. However, by the middle of May that same year, nearly every student had a device for instruction. The remaining students were provided a device in time to start the 2020-21 school year in August.\n\nWe remained fully remote at the beginning of the school year based on our local COVID-19 realities. As we monitored the data, it was necessary for us to remain fully remote until February. We invited small groups of special education students to return to their school buildings one or two days each week. However, many parents declined this opportunity. We invited groups of general education students to return to their school buildings one or two days each week in March. Only about 15 percent of our total student population participated in person, while the remainder continued fully remote. By the end of the year, we had increased our percentage of in-person students to approximately 25 percent.\n\nMandated in-person state assessments also added to the dilemma of planning for instruction in the spring. Thirty-five percent of our English-language learners participated in their mandated assessment, and approximately 42 percent of students in grades 3-8 participated in the state-mandated assessments. Unfortunately, the time spent ensuring mandated assessments were managed and monitored appropriately took time away from instruction—for students attending in-personandthose still fully remote.\n\nWas everyone successful in our fully virtual learning environment? No. Some students thrived while others struggled. As an educator, I realize that not every instructional model or strategy works for every student. Therefore, I want options in my toolbox so that I can assist students to be successful.\n\nAs a district superintendent, it is essential that I have options to offer families that help place their children in the best learning environments for them. Allowing parents a choice among fully online, hybrid, and in-person learning is the right thing to do as we move into a postpandemic world. Why would we go backward when we can augment our options for students to better ensure their success?\n\nThere have been several lessons learned during the past terrible 16 months. The public’s eyes have been opened about how difficult it is to provide a quality education to diverse student populations. We’ve gained some hard-won insights into the challenges and benefits associated with different approaches to helping students succeed. We’ve doubtless made ..."}

The Fed has raised interest rates multiple times over the past year to try and help cool inflation, and Powell says that may need to happen at a faster rate because inflation is still out of control.\n\n\"If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we'd be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,\" Powell told the U.S. Senate.\n\nConsumer spending and economic data have both been stronger than expected start to 2023, but inflation has remained stubbornly high.

The House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing in Oklahoma where business owners talked about the economic squeeze they're feeling.\n\n\"We've seen firsthand how out of control costs have gotten in the last several years.

Democrat Tom Suozzi’s victory over Republican Mazi Melesa Pilip in the special election in New York’s third congressional district isn’t an enormous shock, but the margin is ominous. The issues of an insecure border and dealing with an influx of migrants were front and center in voters’ minds, and yet the GOP candidate still couldn’t win. Republicans fell short in a Pennsylvania state house election yesterday, too, further evidence that the suburbs — which used to be fertile territory — continue to reject what the GOP is offering. And there’s little sign that anything will change between now and November. But hey, good news: We had a terrific guest on theThree Martini Lunchpodcast yesterday.\n\nGOP Losses Continue to Mount\n\nYou can over-analyze special House elections. The turnout is low, the electorate is usually not as tuned in as in a November election, and you usually have two lesser-known candidates.\n\nBut all things being equal, Republicans would have preferred to win yesterday’s special election in New York’s third congressional district than lose it. (The House now has 219 Republicans; 212 Democrats; one Democratic congressman-elect who will be sworn in soon; and three vacancies: two in GOP-leaning districts, and one in a Democratic-leaning district.)\n\nYes, this is a Biden district covering parts of Long Island and Queens; the president beat Donald Trump here, 54 percent to 44 percent, in 2020. But in 2022, Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin won this district by the same margin, and the infamous and then uninvestigated George Santos won this district last cycle, 53 percent to 44 percent. Republicans can win in New York’s third congressional district, if they just get a bit of wind at their backs.\n\nBut as of this writing, it looks like it wasn’t that close. With 93 percent of the votes counted, former Democratic representative Tom Suozzi has almost 54 percent of the vote, and Republican Nassau County legislator Mazi Melesa Pilip has around 46 percent.\n\nSure, having represented the area in Congress from 2017 to 2023 before choosing to run for governor, Suozzi was a quasi-incumbent. Sure, yesterday’s snow depressed turnout. And if you want to argue Pilip was a less than ideal candidate, you can; she was political newcomer, “a registered Democrat and Ethiopian-Israeli immigrant who formerly served in the Israel Defense Forces and had flipped a local legislative seat in 2021 with the help of local Republicans.” On the other hand,as our Audrey Fahlberg reported, Pilip — as an Ethiopian-Israeli legal immigrant woman — seemed like the ideal candidate to pound Democrats on the issue of the border and illegal immigration:\n\nIt’s no wonder then that Republican candidate Mazi Melesa Pilip, a Nassau County legislator in the Long Island suburbs, has conducted press conferences in front of migrant shelters like theCreedmoor Psychiatric Centerin Queens, where sheintroducesherself to prospective supporters as a “legal immigrant.”\n\n“We have a tent city around us,” Pilip toldNational Reviewin an interview. “We need to secure the border as soon as possible.” . . .\n\nSuozzi is feeling the heat on immigration and has spent weeks portraying himself as hawkish on border security on the stump and incampaign ads. But even outside Democraticspending groupsare struggling to push back against Republican attack ads that replay comments Suozzi made during a Democratic gubernatorial debate last cycle about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, when he bragged that while serving as Nassau County Executive, “I kicked ICE from Nassau County.”\n\nThe former congressman says those comments are now being taken out of context and pertain to anincidentthat occurred nearly two decades ago when ICE agents improperly brandished their weapons against local Nassau County police officers and residents during an anti-gang operation. But even short, clipped campaign videos can do a lot of damage in contested political races.\n\nAsNational Reviewreportedearlier this month, Suozziclaimedon the campaign trail in January that he doesn’t know what the term “sanctuary city” means.\n\n“Sanctuary cities is such a misnomer, okay, what does that mean?” Suozzi said during a January 17membership meetingof the Plainview-Old Bethpage Chamber of Commerce. “Can you tell me what it means? Can anyone here tell me what that means? No, but it’s this thing that is thrown out there. It doesn’t mean anything. It’s such a misused terminology.”\n\nSuozzi made a perfect stand-in for the Biden administration’s policies. During his two years i..."}

All rights reserved.FAQ-New Privacy Policy\n\nBlackRock Global Fixed Income CIO Rick Rieder discusses whether the Fed is close to ending the current rate hike cycle on 'The Claman Countdown.'\n\nTheFederal Reserveon Wednesday held interest rates steady for the second time this year, pausing its tightening campaign to assess how the economy is faring in the face of higher borrowing costs.\n\nThe widely expected decision left interest rates unchanged at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level since 2001. But policymakers also left the door open to an additional increase before the end of the year – and indicated that rates are likely to remain at peak levels longer than previously expected.\n\nNew economic projections laid out after the meeting show that a majority of Fed officials who participated in the meeting expect rates to rise to 5.6% by the end of 2023, suggesting one more quarter-point increase this year. The Fed meets two more times this year, in November and December.\n\n\"We're prepared to raise rates further, if appropriate, and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we're confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objective,\"Chairman Jerome Powelltold reporters at a post-meeting press conference in Washington.\n\nFED SKIPS AN INTEREST RATE HIKE, BUT HIGH MORTGAGE RATES COULD BE HERE TO STAY\n\nThe central bank is projecting a peak rate of 5.6%, indicating that policymakers believe there is still more work to be done to wrangle inflation under control. Twelve of the 18 policymakers predicted one more quarter-point rate hike, while six supported keeping rates unchanged.\n\nThe meeting comes one week after the Labor Department reported the consumer price index,a key measure of inflation,accelerated 0.6% in August. It marked the steepest monthly increase this year. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.7%. While that is down from a peak of 9.1% hit last summer, it remains about twice the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nOther parts of the report also pointed to a slower retreat for inflation. Core prices, which exclude the more volatile measurements of food and energy, climbed 0.3% last month and 4.3% annually. While both of those figures are lower than previous readings, the monthly core measure climbed faster than expected.\n\n\"We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level. We’re seeing progress and we welcome that,\" Powell said. \"But, you know, we need to see more progress before we’ll be willing to reach that conclusion.\"\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference in Washington, D.C., on March 22, 2023.(Al Drago/Bloomberg via / Getty Images)\n\nThe quarterly forecasts indicate the U.S. central bank will not cut interest rates until 2024, to a rate of about 5.1%. By comparison, in June, Fed officials anticipated they would lower borrowing costs to 4.6% next year.\n\nWHOLESALE INFLATION SURGES MORE THAN EXPECTED IN AUGUST\n\nPolicymakers have raised interest rates sharply over the past year, approving 11 rate increases in the hopes of crushing inflation andcooling the economy. In the span of just one year, interest rates surged from near zero to above 5%, the fastest pace of tightening since the 1980s.\n\nHiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. Higher rates have helped push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 7% for the first time in years. Borrowing costs for everything from home equity lines of credit, auto loans and credit cards have also spiked.\n\nA pedestrian passes the Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C., on June 3, 2023.(Nathan Howard/Bloomberg / Getty Images)\n\nDespite the rapid increase in rates, the economy has proven surprisingly resilient.\n\nThe labor market is continuing to chug along at a healthy pace, withemployers adding 187,000new workers in August. Job openings remain high, although the unemployment rate recently ticked up to 3.8% from 3.5%.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe fresh forecasts laid out Wednesday illustrate that most central bankers anticipate the jobless rate will hold steady at 3.8%, lower than their previous 4.1% estimate.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Supreme Court Justices Sotomayor And Barrett Assure Americans Supreme Court Isn T Partisan", "output": "Supreme Court JusticesSonia SotomayorandAmy Coney Barrettspoke about the inner workings of the high court — and the lessons it can teach everyone else about bipartisanship — in a Friday afternoon panel discussion.\n\nDuring an hourlong session, theSupreme Courtstalwarts were asked to speak on how people can disagree better. The topic is part of a theme of the National Governors Association winter meetings, which are being held at a downtownWashington, D.C., hotel.\n\nSotomayor, 69, said justices do not speak in person ahead of oral arguments presented to the court so as to preserve their initial thinking before hearing arguments.\n\n“That’s generally been what happens,” she said. “The first time you hear us talking to each other [about a case] is at oral arguments.”\n\nBut they do speak in person, and quite frequently, at other times.\n\nBarrett, 52, said the justices have lunch four times a week when the court is in session, and stressed the importance of face time in communicating both at the court and in the wider world.\n\n“One of the worst post-COVID developments that we have is that people spend less time face-to-face,” Barrett said. “I think it’s a lot easier to demonize someone or to resent someone when you’re not interacting with them in flesh and blood on a regular basis.”\n\nShe later said she discourages remote work for her clerks for the same reason.\n\nBut Barrett acknowledged that taking a bipartisan stance is easier for court justices than for legislators for a number of reasons, including the fact that there’s no need for forced compromise.\n\n“Being on the court is a little different than being in a legislature because you don’t want to compromise,” she said. “I think that Justice Sotomayor would agree with this. We wouldn’t compromise on or, like, sausage-make on what we think the Constitution requires.”\n\n“It wouldn’t work well to have a ‘my way or the highway’ attitude in that process,” Barrett said.\n\nAnother major difference between the court and Congress is the total lack of cameras inside the courtroom. Sotomayor argued that the presence of cameras undermines bipartisanship in multiple ways.\n\n“What’s happening, regrettably, in too many legislative processes, is because there are cameras in your chamber, many legislators and others are not sitting in the room anymore,” Sotomayor said. “If you’re not listening, you’re not going to be able to think about what other people are saying.”\n\nLater, Sotomayor said, “I think the worst thing that’s happened to the judiciary is political parties,” which have adopted some of the court’s nuanced terminology to throw around as buzzwords. She even joked that she’s thankful “U.S. presidents don’t last that long,” with the court’s lifetime appointments providing a measure of insulation from political bickering.\n\nGov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) opened the session by outlining his concerns about slipping bipartisanship.\n\n“Republicans and Democrats increasingly view the other side not just as misguided, but as immoral and dishonest,” he said. “Thirty percent of Americans have ended a family relationship because of politics.”\n\nThat concern led him to launch the “Disagree Better” initiative, he said, which now includes a full college course being taught at Colorado State University.\n\nA group of governors in town for the NGA conference met earlier Friday with PresidentJoe Biden, though notably absent were top Republican Govs.Ron DeSantis(R-FL) andGreg Abbott(R-TX), the latter of which is in a legal battle with the Biden administration over immigration.\n\nCox noted that governors at the White House mingled together with no respect to party affiliation. Furthering this notion, he was joined in the afternoon session by Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO), with whom he launched “Disagree Better.”\n\n“As Arthur Brooks said, almost no one is ever insulted into agreement,” Polis said. “And so again, even on a purely pragmatic basis, if your goal is to move or change the status quo, you’re unlikely to get there by demonizing and attacking your enemies.”\n\nBarrett stressed that notion during the discussion. She still teaches college courses on occasion and tells her students they should feel free to express their views.\n\n“Everyone needs to assume from everyone else the exact kind of good faith that Justice Sotomayor was talking about,” she said.\n\n“If we can’t survive by tolerating differences and learning to compromise, and learning to allow one another to express other views, we’re going to sink,” she said. “We won’t be able to get anything done as a country.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSotomayor agreed.\n\n“It is much easier to disagree agreeably,” she said.\n\nNotifications"}

If the Fed goes ahead with the move, it would make a full dozen hikes since the policy tightening began in March 2022.\n\nMarkets had fully priced in no move at this meeting, which kept the fed funds rate in a targeted range between 5.25%-5.5%, the highest in some 22 years. The rate fixes what banks charge each other for overnight lending but alsospills over into many forms of consumer debt.\n\nWhile the no-hike was expected, there was considerable uncertainty over where the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee would go from here. Judging from documents released Wednesday, the bias appears toward more restrictive policy and a higher-for-longer approach to interest rates.\n\nThat outlook weighed on the market, withthe S&P 500 falling nearly1% and the Nasdaq Composite off 1.5%. Stocks oscillated as Fed ChairJerome Powelltook questions duringa news conference.\n\n\"We're in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming,\" Powell said.\n\nHowever, he added that the central bank would like to see more progress in its fight against inflation.\n\n\"We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level, and we're seeing progress and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more progress before we'll be willing to reach that conclusion,\" he said.\n\nProjections released inthe Fed's dot plotshowed the likelihood of one more increase this year, then two cuts in 2024, two fewer than were indicated during the last update in June. That would put the funds rate around 5.1%. The plot allows members to indicate anonymously where they think rates are headed.\n\nTwelve participants at the meeting penciled in the additional hike, while seven opposed it. That put one more in opposition than at the June meeting. Recently confirmed Fed Governor Adriana Kugler was not a voter at the last meeting. The projection for the fed funds rate also moved higher for 2025, with the median outlook at 3.9%, compared with 3.4% previously.\n\nOver the longer term, FOMC members pointed to a funds rate of 2.9% in 2026. That's above what the Fed considers the \"neutral\" rate of interest that is neither stimulative nor restrictive for growth. This was the first time the committee provided a look at 2026. The long-run expected neutral rate held at 2.5%.\n\n\"Chair Powell and the Fed sent an unambiguously hawkish higher-for-longer message at today's FOMC meeting,\" wrote Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst. \"The Fed is projecting inflation to steadily cool, while the labor market remains historically tight. But, in our view, a sustained imbalance in the labor market is more likely to keep inflation 'stuck' above target.\"\n\nAlong with the rate projections, members also sharply revised up their economic growth expectations for this year, with gross domestic product now expected to increase 2.1% this year. That was more than double the June estimate and indicative that members do not anticipate a recession anytime soon. The 2024 GDP outlook moved up to 1.5%, from 1.1%.\n\nThe expected inflation rate, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures price index, also moved lower to 3.7%, down 0.2 percentage point from June, as did the outlook for unemployment, now projected at 3.8%, compared with 4.1% previously.\n\nThere werea few changes in the post-meeting statementthat reflected the adjustment in the economic outlook.\n\nThe committee characterized economic activity as \"expanding at a solid pace,\" compared with \"moderate\" in previous statements. It also noted that job gains \"have slowed in recent months but remain strong.\" That contrasts with earlier language describing the employment picture as \"robust.\"\n\nIn addition to holding rates at relatively high levels, the Fed is continuing to reduce its bond holdings, a process that has cut the central bank balance sheet by some $815 billion since June 2022. The Fed is allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off each month, rather than reinvesting them.\n\nThe Fed's actions come at a delicate time for the U.S. economy.\n\nIn recent public appearances, Fed officials have indicated a shift in thinking, from believing that it was better to do too much to bring down inflation to a new view that is more balanced. That's partly due to perceived lagged impacts from the rate hikes, which represented the toughest Fed monetary policy since the early 1980s.\n\nThere have been growing signs that the central bank may yet achieve its soft landing of bringing down inflation without tipping the economy into a deep recession. However, the future remains far from certain, and Fed officials..."}

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — PresidentJoe Biden’sreelection campaign is spending $50 million through the end of June, a blitz that includes its first television ad trumpetingDonald Trump’sfelony conviction and signals that the Democratic incumbent is seeking to make his Republican opponent’s legal woes a bigger issue heading into November.\n\nThe advertising push comes with Election Day still months away. But Biden’s campaign says it wants to more clearly define the choice between the candidates ahead ofthe first debate between themin Atlanta on June 27.\n\nThe ad campaign includes more than $1 million geared toward media reaching Black, Hispanic and Asian American voters and a spot highlightingTrump’s conviction on 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case. It will air on general market television and connected TV on streaming devices and cellphones in battleground states as well as on national cable.\n\nBesides Trump’s criminal conviction, the ad, titled “Character Matters,” notes the former president also was found liable forsexual assaultandfinancial fraudin separate proceedings. Trump also faces felony charges in three other criminal cases, none of which may go to trial before the November election.\n\n“In the courtroom, we see Donald Trump for who he is,” intones the ad’s narrator. It adds over images of a Trump mug shot and Biden high-fiving supporters, “This election is between a convicted criminal who’s only out for himself and a president who’s fighting for your family.”\n\nBiden also has frequently talked about Trump’s 34 felony convictions whiledecrying the former presidentfor claiming that the case against him was politically motivated. Biden argues that “it’s reckless, it’s dangerous, it’s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don’t like the verdict.”\n\nBiden’s son Hunter last week was convicted in Delaware ofthree felony chargesrelated tothe purchase of a revolver in 2018, when, prosecutors argued, he lied on a mandatory gun purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. The president has said he would accept the outcome of the case and “continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.”\n\nA central part of Biden’s reelection strategy is alsohighlighting Trump’s policy proposalsfor a second term and firing up disaffected Democrats and independent voters. Still, the campaign producing an ad that leans heavily intoTrump’s convictionand including it in such a large advertising buy indicates a renewed effort to make Trump’s legal problems an election issue in waysBiden’s team previously resisted.\n\n“It’s a stark contrast, and it’s one that matters deeply to the American people,” Biden campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler said in a statement. “And it’s why we will make sure that every single day we are reminding voters about how Joe Biden is fighting for them, while Donald Trump runs a campaign focused on one man and one man only: himself.”\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing and has argued, without evidence, that Biden or Justice Department officials orchestrated the New York case against him for political reasons. He and his allies also have raised the prospect ofprosecuting political opponents in revengeif he returns to the White House.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the Biden administration had “weaponized the justice system against President Trump” and that the contrast between her candidate and Biden “will be very clear on the debate stage.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the Biden spokesperson’s surname is Tyler, not Taylor.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

It represents people whose lives were saved — people who are still here to see their children grow up, to work toward fulfilling their dreams, and to contribute to their communities.”\n\nIn Philadelphia, Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel echoed Garland, telling NBC News, \"We’re excited about the trend that we’re seeing.\"\n\n\"Summer is just starting so, you know, we are also very cautious that we don't overstate and overestimate the direction we're going,\" Bethel added.\n\nBut during the pandemic \"we had the highest number of homicides and shootings ever in the history of the city of Philadelphia,\" Bethel said. \"We’re not going in that direction.\"\n\nBrian Higgins, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said there could be a correlation between the crime decline and the efforts in recent years to beef up police forces that lost officers in the aftermath of theGeorge Floyd murderand amid calls to “Defund the Police.”\n\n\"It wasn't just the pandemic that was causing crime to rise,\" said Higgins, who previously was chief of police in Bergen County, New Jersey. \"We need to make more investments in police training and that wasn't happening.\"\n\nAsher, however, said \"defund the police\" was more of a talking point. \"We didn't see a lot of defunding actually happen,\" he said.\n\nBut so many societal factors affect crime rates, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact reason why crime goes up and down, he said.\n\n\"We still don't really know why crime went down in the 1990s,\" Asher said.\n\nWhat's clear, however, is that the public continues to believe that crime is worse than it is, according to a recentPew Research Centerreport. And Republicans, more than Democrats, believe tackling crimeshould be a presidential priority.\n\nSo the new UCR report could potentially undermine what has been a regularcampaign talking pointfor Donald Trump — that on President Joe Biden’s watch “violent crime has skyrocketed in virtually every American city,\" the experts said.\n\n“This progress we’re seeing is no accident,”Biden said in a statementreleased Monday after the UCR report came out. “My administration is putting more cops on the beat, holding violent criminals accountable, and getting illegal guns off the street — and we’re doing it in partnership with communities. As a result, Americans are safer today than when I took office.”\n\nThe Biden campaign used blunter language and noted that crime soared on Trump’s presidential watch during the pandemic.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a convicted criminal who enabled the largest spike in violent crime in more than a century,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. “President Biden has worked hard to clean up his mess, and it’s working.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the latest crime stats.\n\nBut whenNBCNewsreported in Marchthat violent and other crime rates were down, citing available FBI and law enforcement statistics, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the findings.\n\n“Joe Biden is trying to convince Americans not to believe their own eyes,” Leavitt said in a statement, adding that “Democrats have turned great American cities into cesspools of bloodshed and crime.”\n\nTom Costello is an NBC News correspondent based in Washington, D.C.\n\nCorky Siemaszko is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"}

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden declared Tuesday he is sticking to his Aug. 31 deadline for completing a risky airlift of Americans, endangered Afghans and others seeking to escape Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The decisiondefies allied leaderswho want to give the evacuation more time and opens Biden to criticism that he caved to Taliban deadline demands.\n\n“Every day we’re on the ground is another day that we know ISIS-K is seeking to target the airport and attack both us and allied forces and innocent civilians,” Biden said at the White House, referring to the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate, which is known for staging suicide attacks on civilians.\n\nHe said the Taliban are cooperating and security is holding despite a number of violent incidents. “But it’s a tenuous situation,” he said, adding, “We run a serious risk of it breaking down as time goes on.”\n\nThe United States in recent days has ramped up its airlift amid new reports of rights abuses that fuel concern about the fate of thousands of people who fear retribution from the Taliban and are trying to flee the country. The Pentagon said 21,600 people had been evacuated in the 24 hours that ended Tuesday morning, and Biden said an additional 12,000 had been flown out in the 12 hours that followed. Those include flights operated by the U.S. military as well as other charter flights.\n\nBiden said he had asked the Pentagon and State Department for evacuation contingency plans that would adjust the timeline for full withdrawal should that become necessary.\n\nStay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.\n\nPentagon officials expressed confidence the airlift, which started on Aug. 14, can get all Americans out by next Tuesday, the deadline Biden had set long before the Taliban completed their takeover. But unknown thousands of other foreign nationals remain in Afghanistan and are struggling to get out.\n\nThe Taliban, who have wrested control of the country back nearly 20 years after being ousted in a U.S.-led invasion after the 9/11 attacks, insist the airlift must end on Aug. 31. Any decision by Biden to stay longer could reignite a war between the militants and the approximately 5,800 American troops who are executing the airlift at Kabul airport.\n\nIn Kabul, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference the U.S. must stick to its self-imposed deadline, saying “after that we won’t let Afghans be taken out” on evacuation flights. He also said the Taliban would bar Afghans from accessing roads to the airport, while allowing foreigners to pass in order to prevent large crowds from massing.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman John Kirby said Aug. 31 leaves enough time to get all Americans out, but he was less specific about completing the evacuation of all at-risk Afghans. He said about 4,000 American passport holders and their family members had been evacuated from Kabul as of Tuesday.\n\n“We expect that number to grow in coming days,” Kirby said.\n\nWith the full U.S. withdrawal looming, the Pentagon said s..."}

Though Musk did not reference the bill directly in his America Party posts, the timing suggests rising friction between the billionaire and the president. Musk has previously warned that unchecked spending by both parties threatens the long-term health of the economy.\n\nThe new party, according to Musk’s posts, will target a few key seats in Congress.

It ended with a fiery,passionate defensefrom Brett Kavanaugh that cemented Republican support for their embattled Supreme Court nominee.\n\nAfter more than seven hours of questions and answers, heated rhetoric and tearful recollections, not one senator said publicly they had changed their mind about Kavanaugh's bid to sit on the nation's highest court.\n\nAnd most lawmakers on the fence – specifically just a handful of moderates in each party – stayed there, at least for now.\n\nOnly one, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.,announced his decision. Both Ford and Kavanaugh were \"compelling,\" but the nominee \"deserves the presumption of innocence\" and he's qualified for the lifetime appointment, Corker said.\n\nOther wavering senators, including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona, hold Kavanaugh’s fate in their hands. They stayed mostly mum on Thursday, with several going out of their way to avoid reporters stationed across the Capitol.\n\nFlake, a member of the committee, gaveno hint of his leaningsand asked no questions at the hearing. Instead, he described the committee as a group of 21 \"imperfect\" individuals, and said that the two witnesses' conflicting accounts left considerable doubt.\n\n\"We’ll never move beyond that,\" the Arizona senator declared.\n\nOthers lawmakers in Washington absorbed the bruising hearing and then retreated to their partisan camps. Senate Democrats escalated their demands for an FBI investigation and a delay in the nomination process. Republicans stuck to their collective message that the vote should be held as quickly as possible.\n\n\"I think it’s time to vote,\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters after the marathon hearing ended. \"The longer that the nomination remains open, we know that more and more of these scurrilous, anonymous and uncorroborated allegations will be made.\"\n\nOf Ford's testimony, he added, \"I don’t think they’ve met their burden of proof.\"\n\n\"We believe her,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tweeted from the other side of the partisan divide.\n\nSeveral Democrats suggested that Kavanaugh's combative testimony was in itself disqualifying.\n\n“Judge Kavanaugh exhibited temperament Americans do not want in fair judges,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. \"He was discourteous, lashing out at senators raising legitimate questions, and made unfounded conspiracy allegations about imagined plots by political enemies.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said if Republicans are \"so certain of Judge Kavanaugh’s story, they should immediately demand that the White House order the FBI to reopen the background investigation, and hold off on a vote for several days so all the facts can come out.”\n\nHouse Democrats also stepped into the fray, even though they have no vote on the nomination and no real power to influence the outcome.\n\nA pair of House Democrats asked President Donald Trump to withdraw the nomination altogether. And more than 60 House Democrats urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to postpone a vote on Kavanaugh.\n\n“As a lifetime appointment to our nation’s highest court is on the line, we implore you to abandon the artificial timeline you have created, support these women who have come forward, and do your duty to the American people by conducting a fair and balanced nomination process,” the Democratic lawmakers said in a missive to McConnell.\n\nIt was hyper-political end to an extraordinary day on Capitol Hill. At 10 a.m., the riveting Senate hearing began to play in congressional offices, in hallways, in bathrooms – on cell phones, on computer screens, and on televisions. It also aired on Air Force One, with Fox News’s coverage live as President Donald Trump flew back to Washington from New York.\n\nTrump later condemned Democrats and pressed for a quick vote on his nominee.\n\n\"Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist,\" Trump tweeted. \"The Senate must vote!\"\n\nIn the hearing room, at least one Democratic lawmaker wept openly as Ford delivered her account of sexual assault from more than three decades ago.

Serena Williams was defeated in two sets by 20-year-old Japanese player Naomi Osaka, narrowly missing a chance to tie the all-time record for Grand Slam singles titles.\n\nWilliams' defeat came after she was issued a questionable code violation for receiving coaching. She was then docked a point for breaking her racket, followed by a pivotal penalty in which she gave up a game because she accused the chair umpire of lying.\n\nRarely, if ever, have we seen Serena Williams, arguably the best player to ever step on the court, reduced to tears during a match. We've seen her fiery. We've seen her enraged. But eye filled with tears, voice cracking, as she defiantly defends her position and demands the respect she has more than earned? This was new.\n\nSparring repeatedly with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, Williams refused to back down, and in doing so, highlighted the double standard in expectations and discipline that exists for men and women on the biggest stages in professional tennis. Several of her male peers took to Twitter to lament the unfortunate discrepancy.\n\nWorst refereeing I’ve ever seen ......   the worst !!!\n\nI will admit I have said worse and not gotten penalized.  And I’ve also been given a “soft warning” by the ump where they tell you knock it off or I will have to give you a violation.  He should have at least given her that courtesy.  Sad to mar a well played final that way.https://t.co/xhBzFZX8Wq\n\nNo matter how you think professional athletes should behave, Williams is right to be angry. Male players are often excused — celebrated, even — for putting their emotions on display in the heat of the moment. In fact, Ramos — the very same umpire who penalized Williams a game for calling him a \"thief\" and accusing him of lying — has tolerated similar, and arguably worse, outbursts from male players on numerous occasions.\n\nAt the 2016 French Open, Australian player Nick Kyrgios blew up at Ramos after he was given a warning for raising his voice at a ballboy. \"That's bulls**t. Are you kidding?\" Kyrgios shouted at the official. \"Bulls**t, f***ing bulls**t.\" He was given neither a point penalty, nor a game penalty.\n\nAt the 2017 French Open, former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal threatened Ramos, \"Give me the warnings you can, because you will not referee me anymore,\" he said. Nadal referenced his comments in a post-match press conference. No penalties were given.\n\n“Give me the warnings you can because you will not referee me any more.” Rafael Nadal to Carlos Ramos. Not surprisingly, no point taken against Nadal. Thanks Ramos and ⁦@usopen⁩ for this master class on what it costs to be an assertive black woman.https://t.co/GFchpFmiga\n\nThat same tournament, defending champion Novak Djokovic got into an impassioned argument with Ramos, approaching the chair to tell him, \"You're losing your mind.\" The skirmish came after Djokovic was docked a first serve for taking too long in the fourth set. He glowered at Ramos, motioned with his racket while uttering something in Serbian, then approached the chair to call the official's sanity into question.\n\nWhile Djokovic was issued a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct, he was never officially penalized and ultimately went on to stage a five-set comeback. Perhaps Ramos considered Djokovic and Nadal's outbursts as somehow less offensive than that of Serena Williams. Perhaps there is some sort of subconscious bias at play. But these sort of double standards extend far beyond a single chair umpire. They have been rampant for decades.\n\nDuring a semifinals match at the 2016 Cincinnati Masters in Ohio, British tennis star Andy Murray quite literally kicked a ball at the chair umpire's head. And despite the ATP rulebook clearly stating that \"players shall not violently, dangerously or with anger hit, kick or throw a tennis ball while on the grounds of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match,\" Murray was not disqualified. The umpire simply hit him with a pointed look and Murray went on to win the match, advancing to the final.\n\nAt the 1991 U.S. Open, five-time champion Jimmy Connors got into a series of heated exchanges with chair umpire David Littlefield. Connors called Littlefield's decisions \"bull crap\" and repeatedly shouted that Littlefield himself was \"an abortion.\" After each of Connors' tirades, the crowd can be heard enthusiastically cheering along with him. Littlefield can be seen raising his eyebrows, occasionally extending prolonged, disapproving glances in Connors' direction, but otherwise remaining measured and letting the outbursts slide. No penalties are given. No points taken. No games sacrificed. Connors goes on to win the match.\n\nPerhaps even more indicative o..."}

Reconciliation requires just a simple majority to pass legislation, rather than the 60-vote threshold typically needed.\n\nManchin reiterated his opposition to the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill on Wednesday, further intensifying the fight between progressives and moderates ahead of Thursday’s infrastructure vote.\n\nHe called the larger bill the “definition of fiscal insanity” and said he didn’t believe he would reach an agreement with the White House soon.\n\nThe West Virginia senator reiterated his concerns about the massive spending package causing inflation and called for the bill’s measures to be means-tested.\n\n“While I am hopeful that common ground can be found that would result in another historic investment in our nation, I cannot — and will not — support trillions in spending or an all-or-nothing approach that ignores the brutal fiscal reality our nation faces,” Manchin said.\n\nMeanwhile, Representative Stephanie Murphy (D., Fla.), a co-chair of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, warned on Wednesday that if the infrastructure vote failed, “there would be a significant breach in trust that would slow the momentum in moving forward in delivering the Biden agenda.”\n\nSend a tip to the news team atNR.\n\nAbbas allegedly ordered the chemical abortion pills Mifepristone and Misopristol using an out-of-state telemedical abortionist.\n\nAs Oscar Wilde might have said, to lose one presidency over economic angst may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.\n\nConcerns such as mental health or body image issues are not contraindications to pediatric patients receiving hormone therapy, according to AAFP.\n\n‘With rising threats to free speech and open debate, the Federalist Society is celebrating the students who every day defend the Constitution.’\n\nIn one email, sent to author Michael Wolff in 2019, Epstein wrote, ‘Of course [Trump] knew about the girls.’\n\nOverwhelming majorities once believed that working hard and playing by the rules would grant the next generation a better life than their parents’.

It’s illegal for the NSA to spy on American citizens. It's a crime. It's not a third-world country. Things like that should not happen in America. But unfortunately, they do happen, and in this case, they did happen. The whistleblower who is in a position to know repeated back to us information about a story that we are working on that could have only come directly from my texts and emails. There's no other possible source for that information, period.…The NSA captured that information without our knowledge and did it for political reasons. The Biden administration is spying on us. We have confirmed that. This morning we filed an FOIA request of Freedom of Information Act request asking for all information that the NSA and other agencies have gathered about this show. We did it mostly as a formality. We've also contacted the press office at both NSA and the FBI. We don't expect to hear much back. That's the way that usually goes.\n\n…\n\nOnly Congress can force transparency on the intelligence agencies and they should do that immediately. Spying on opposition journalists is incompatible with democracy. If they are doing it to us, and again, they are definitely doing it to us, they are almost certainly doing it to others.

In just a few weeks, Ye, the artist formerly known asKanye West, has gone frompotential Republican superstarto a completely disgraced antisemitic lunatic.\n\nKanye's fall from grace hit its nadir on Thursday during a stranger-than-fiction interview he did on InfoWars with far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Ye said, and this is adirect quote, \"I like Hitler.\"\n\n\"I like Hitler,\" Ye expounded. \"The Holocaust is not what happened. Let's look at the facts of that. Hitler has a lot of redeeming qualities.\"\n\nKanye 'Ye' West: “I like Hitler. ... I’m not trying to be shocking, I like Hitler. The Holocaust is not what happened, let’s look at the facts of that and Hitler has a lot of redeeming qualities.”pic.twitter.com/UwCu2ZJfid\n\nIt somehow got even stranger.\n\n\"[Nazis] did good things, too,\" Ye went on to say later in theinterview. \"We've got to stop dissing the Nazis all the time. The Jewish media has made us feel like the Nazis and Hitler have never offered anything of value to the world.\"\n\nIn case there was any shred of doubt left as to Ye's intent, he followed up the interview bytweeting out a literal swastika. (Yes, seriously. You can't make this stuff up.)\n\nJUST IN: Elon Musk removes Kanye West's tweet of what looks like a swastika inside the Star of David.pic.twitter.com/iK8CnozDez\n\nFor tweeting the swastika, Ye was subsequently booted off ofTwitterbyElon Musk. But I think this was a mistake. Musk should have ensured the tweet with the swastika was taken down for violating Twitter's Terms of Service. But banning Kanye misses how crucial letting him have his say has been to the resounding repudiation of his hate speech we've seen across all sectors of the public square.\n\nYe's rants are, of course, horrifying,factually untrue, and hateful. But it still doesn't vindicate proponents of \"cancel culture\" who have called for Kanye to be de-platformed. The opposite: It actually shows why free speech works.\n\nBy interviewing Kanye and giving his terrible ideas an audience, hosts like Tim Pool and even Alex Jones have given Ye the opportunity toimmolate his own career and credibility.Now, after he's gone so far as to literally praise the Nazis and Hitler, almost nobody will continue to take Ye seriously. And any future political career he may have had is almost certainly dead-on-arrival.\n\nA few weeks ago, when the extent of his antisemitism was still more subtle and less open, countless fans and followers were still taking Ye seriously, meaning his ideas were much more dangerous. But if he had been \"deplatformed\" likecritics called for, his public deterioration would've been frozen in its pre-total-implosion state. It also might have vindicated his conspiratorial claims that the powers that be are out to get him, at least, in the minds of those keen to believe such things.\n\nMeanwhile, actually engaging with Ye's arguments in the marketplace of ideas has quickly allowed the public to see how terrible and empty they are. The saga serves as an important reminder that when it comes to hateful speech, sunlight, not suppression, is the best remedy.\n\nOr, asSupreme CourtJustice Louise Brandeisfamously put it, \"Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.\"\n\nWe can't make antisemitism, hate, and conspiracies disappear by ignoring them or attempting to silence their proponents. But we can defeat them by ridiculing and debunking them in the public square. As Professor Wilfred Reillyput it, \"Kanye West saying his gibberish and getting shut down by the entire Internet is a great illustration of why free speech is good, actually.\"\n\nAfter the last week, Kanye West is left looking like a delusional lunatic in desperate need of psychiatric care. His antisemitic ramblings can no longer be explained away as misunderstood arguments or politically incorrect truth-telling.\n\nKanye West only has himself to blame for the implosion of his career and life. Ironically, his racist implosion represents a win for tolerance at the end of the day, and for that, we have free speech to thank.\n\nBrad Polumbo (@Brad_Polumbo) is a libertarian-conservative journalist and the co-founder ofBASEDPolitics.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\n©2025Newsweek Digital LLC"}

Joel Carter, R-Gulfport, denied that the bill is specifically targeted at the capital city, saying it is only one of the municipalities that would be impacted.\n\n\"We keep on hearing Jackson, Jackson, Jackson,\" Carter said. \"I have a $100 million problem in my district because the rates were not set correctly, so we can sit here and say Jackson all we want. What I'm trying to do is make billing rates fair, make sure that they maintain their systems, and they are charging enough to make sure that they're incurring future costs. It's very simple. All municipalities.\"\n\nIfSenate Bill 2338were to become law, municipal utilities would be required to bill residents for their water based exclusively on volume used, as monitored by an accurate metering system. Jackson has struggled to accurately bill rate payers and was in the process ofoverhauling its metering systemwhen third-party administrator Ted Henifin took the reins of the system.\n\nHenifin has floated a billing system that would be based on property size, among other ideas. When Sen. John Horhn, D-Jackson, asked what this bill would mean for a water system under a conservatorship, Carter acknowledged that it would supersede Henifin's authority.\n\n\"You're referencing Jackson water, obviously,\" Carter said. \"They would have to follow state law.\"\n\nHorhn then asked what the consequences would be for not following state law. The bill does not outline any punishment for not solely using volumetric usage, but Carter later said it could open up municipalities to lawsuits from residents who feel they have been overbilled.\n\nSen. Jeremy England, R-Vancleave, asked Carter whether he knew of any city that uses property size as a deciding factor for water bills.\n\n\"I have never heard of such of a thing,\" Carter said. \"Every successful municipality that manages their water system properly uses a metering system.\"\n\nA number of Democrats in the chamber criticized the bill for taking power out of the hands of Henifin and other local leaders to decide how to charge residents for water.\n\nAn amendment from Sen. Barbara Blackmon, D-Canton, would have made the mandate apply not just to municipalities but also to rural water associations, but that amendment failed. Carter, England and other supporters of the underlying legislation voted against the amendment.\n\nSen. David Blount, D-Jackson, who represents residents of Byram that are rate payers of the Jackson water system, spoke against the bill.\n\n\"I'm doing my best to keep up with all of the bills in the House and the Senate that affect the area that I represent that are introduced by people who don't represent the area where I live, and none of whom have come to talk to me about the bills they are filing about the area that I represent. It's a lot to keep up with,\" Blount said. \"I think if I was going to introduce a bill that affected the area you represent, I'd come see you about it, and come talk to you about it.\"\n\nBlount said he has no problem with billing systems based on usage, but that the legislature should have conversations with Henifin before passing any laws affecting him. Blount was one of many Democratic senators to point to Henifin's roughly 40 years of experience in the water utility industry.\n\n\"There are residents in the city of Byram that have been charged an unfair water rate for years, that is not based on usage, and I have introduced legislation to try to change that for the folks I represent in Byram,\" Blount said. \"What I would do, if I had language that was aimed at one municipality, is I'd call the guy who's running the water system, and ask him how do we do this?\"\n\nBlount said not consulting with Jackson-area Senators or with Henifin is a sign of disrespect.\n\n\"We may disagree on things, and that's fine, but give us that basic respect, and I believe on an issue like this I believe we could actually come to some sort of agreement, if you talked to the person who is in there every single day dealing with water meters and dealing with billing and trying to fix it,\" Blount said. \"That's not happening, and it needs to start happening, and it needs to happen on all of the other bills that have been introduced on both sides (of the capitol).\"\n\nThe topic of legislators who represent other areas proposing bills that limit Jackson is one that has come up a number of times in session already.A billthat would transfer ownership of the water system from the city to a nine-member board was proposed by Sen.

Elon Musk's Tesla has also lost 45% of itsmarket valuesince January — shaving more than $500 billion off of its market cap.\n\nThe problem has been exacerbated byinflationandglobal uncertainty, with experts predicting that a recessioncould be around the corner.\n\nHere's what you need to know about bear markets, and what you should do when you find yourself in one.\n\nPut simply, bear market is the term used to describe when the equity markets are down 20% or more from their most recent all-time high. In this case, the S&P 500 index closed Monday at 3,749.91, with its previous high being 4,818.62.\n\nSince World War II, there have been 14 bear markets that have pulled the S&P down an average of 30%,according to CNBC. Each bear market is unique, says Laura Veldkamp, a finance and economics professor at Columbia University, and the current one has a slew of causes.\n\nTwo of those causes are interest rates being raised to fight runaway inflation and pandemic-related uncertainty fueling the stock slide as investors try to figure out the long-term repercussions that Covid-19 will have on the global economy, Veldkamp says.\n\n\"The truth is, nobody knows what will be the long-term consequences of having [shut down parts of the economy for long periods of time], because we don't have any experience having done it before,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"Wherever there's a lot of guessing and a lot of uncertainty, that means people's beliefs can move around a lot. And with those beliefs go stock prices.\"\n\nFor many investors, seeing their investment portfolios turn red can be alarming and make them want to pull their money out to avoid further losses. But this is the wrong strategy, Veldkamp says.\n\n\"Do not sell right now unless you absolutely need that money,\" she says. \"If you're a young person who's putting some stocks in a 401(k) for retirement, don't worry about this. Just keep doing what you're doing.\"\n\nIndeed, bear markets \"are historically fantastic opportunities to build wealth for longer-term investors,\" says Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.\n\n\"An investor that starts off methodically putting money into a 401(k) is going to have a bigger balance 20 or 30 years from now if earlier on during their investing career they were able to take advantage of bear markets versus having to buy at all-time highs all the time,\" he says.\n\nStill, Stucky recommends that investors don't rush to invest all their money. They should also focus on growing their savings. The important thing is for investors to \"make sure that you can handle these swings\" when buying stocks, because there will be more volatility to come.\n\n\"Just from a sleeping-at-night situation, you don't want your portfolio to create anxiety for you that affects your mental health,\" he says.\n\nThe bright side is that the market has bounced back from every single bear market, Veldkamp says.\n\n\"Have faith that it's going to come back in due course well before you retire,\" she says. \"Usually, it takes a couple of years to recover some losses like this.\"\n\nThe average bear marketlasts 359 days, and Stucky adds that it can take a full 38 months to go from the bottom of a bear market to a new all-time high. He says that getting through an extended stretch like that can be stressful, and for some investors, it might be helpful to get out of the habit of checking their balance frequently.\n\n\"There's no reason you need to introduce more anxiety into your life by looking at your balance multiple times a day or every day or every other day,\" Stucky says. \"You could check it once a month and be fine.\"\n\nSign up now:Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter\n\nDon't miss:Don't wait any longer to book your summer travel, says Scott's Cheap Flights founder\n\nGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nLearn more about the world of CNBC Make It\n\n©2025CNBC LLC.

While American political leaders spar over culture wars and debt ceilings, a powerful coalition of emerging economies known as BRICS is steadily and strategically working to reshape the global economy in its favor. Their next major step comes this July 6–7, when leaders gather in Brazil for the 2025 BRICS Summit, aiming to advance their quiet revolution in global finance.\n\nAt the heart of BRICS’s mission is a low-key but determined campaign to weaken the dominance of the U.S. dollar. And with it, tear down the financial foundation that has underpinned America’s global power for nearly a hundred years.\n\nDespite President Donald Trump’s clear warnings, including threats of 100% tariffs on BRICS goods if the bloc dares introduce its own currency, the group continues laying the groundwork for a parallel financial system. They aren’t launching a formal challenge overnight. Instead, BRICS leaders, particularly China and Russia, are playing the long game. Patiently building the infrastructure needed to strike when the moment is right.\n\nA Growing Bloc with Global Ambition\n\nThe BRICS bloc now represents over 40% of the global population and 30% of the world’s GDP. It was originally made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. With the addition of Indonesia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the UAE, and with dozens more nations seeking “partner country” status, BRICS is transforming into a powerful coalition of the Global South. And a counterweight to the Western-led institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and SWIFT banking system.1\n\nWhile the group lacks a formal treaty or permanent headquarters, its influence is undeniable. Their New Development Bank (NDB) has already expanded lending from $10 billion to $25 billion since 2020. Projects range from Brazilian wind farms to Indian solar parks and South African rail modernization. The investments aren’t just economic. They are political statements of independence from Western finance.2\n\nBuilding a Parallel System\n\nIn June, Russia’s Kirill Dmitriev announced that internal trade among BRICS countries had crossed $1 trillion. That's a major milestone in building economic interdependence without the dollar. China and Russia have been leading the charge. They've signed bilateral agreements to settle trade in yuan and rubles, avoiding SWIFT and dollar-based banking entirely.\n\n“If they block us, we’ll find alternatives,” Putin said, referencing Western sanctions that cut Russia off from major financial networks following its invasion of Ukraine. “Using the dollar as a weapon only accelerates the transition to new financial structures.”3\n\nAnd those structures are coming together. Quietly, but deliberately. BRICS is piloting the BRICS Bridge, a cross-border payment platform built to reduce reliance on the dollar. Indian tech giant Paytm partnered with Brazilian fintech Nubank to test the system, with projections that it could enable $1 trillion in transactions by 2030.\n\nThe group has also floated the idea of a shared BRICS currencybacked by gold. India, wary of giving China too much leverage, has downplayed the idea publicly. Behind the scenes, however, efforts are clearly advancing.\n\n“The goal is not to exclude or isolate,” Putin said, “but to build a fairer economic system — one that cannot be disrupted by political whims.”4\n\nInternal Tensions, External Focus\n\nDespite its ambitions, BRICS is not without friction. India and Brazil favor a slower, consensus-driven approach. China and Russia are pushing aggressively for expansion and deeper integration. Even the upcoming July 6–7 summit in Brazil has been shaken by turmoil. President Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will both skip the event. Putin is avoiding travel due to an ICC warrant and Xi citing “scheduling conflicts.”\n\nBut even as their top leaders stay home, their priorities are moving forward. Russia’s delegation is expected to push for a unified BRICS payments platform and for reforms to global bodies like the IMF and UN Security Council. Demands designed to amplify the voice of what Putin calls the “world’s majority.”\n\nReason for Alarm\n\nThe United States is right to be concerned. The strength of the dollar has long underpinned U.S. global leadership, military power, and economic dominance. But the overuse of sanctions has backfired. Nations are tired of being subject to Washington’s financial dictates. BRICS is becoming the vehicle through which they fight back.\n\nPresident Trump sees the danger clearly. He’s not wrong to warn that a formal BRICS currency could cripple U.S. exports, spike inflation, and undercut global trust in our financial system. If half the world’s population starts transacting in a new currency, or even just chooses to bypass the dollar, the shockwaves through Wall Street, the Fed, and Main Street would be catastrophic.\n\nWestern economists may dismiss ..."}

Those financial ties are likely to face further criticisms as he ramps up his 2024 campaign.\n\nHere's everything that has been said about each family's ties to China:\n\nIn Thursday's memo, Representative James Comernamed Hallie Biden, the widow of the president's late son Beau Biden, as the previously unknown recipient of the payments made by Biden family associate John Robinson Walker.\n\nThe memo said that Hallie, who was romantically linked to Hunter after Beau's death, received two separate payments from Walker totaling $35,000 in 2017. Walker was allegedly wired $3 million dollars from CEFC China Energy, a Chinese Communist Party-backed energy company, in March 2017.\n\nGOP lawmakers have claimed that these transactions raise questions about foreign influence over the Biden family, but the memo did not provide any evidence tying the payments directly to the president, who Republicans have pointed to as the target of their probe.\n\n\"It is unclear what services were provided to obtain this exorbitant amount of money,\" Comer said in a statement.\n\nThe White House and Hunter's team have dismissed the claims as a \"baseless right-wing conspiracy.\"\n\n\"Hunter Biden, a private citizen with every right to pursue his own business endeavors, joined several business partners in seeking a joint venture with a privately-owned, legitimate energy company in China,\" a spokesperson for the president's son said. \"As part of that joint venture, Hunter received his portion of good faith seed funds which he shared with his uncle, James Biden, and Hallie Biden, with whom he was involved with at the time, and sharing expenses.\"\n\nSenate Republicans have previously detailed Walker's wire transfers to Hunter and another member of the Biden family, the president's brother, James, after the men received a $3 million wire from State Energy HK Limited. The Shanghai-based company has previously been tied to CEFC China Energy.\n\nAccording to comer, the $3 million was divided between Hunter, James Gillar (a business partner of Hunter's), Walker, James, Hallie and an \"unknown Biden,\" who allegedly received $70,000.\n\nThe House Oversight obtained the latest financial disclosures after quietly subpoenaingBank of Americafor the records of Walker and two otherHunter Bidenassociates.\n\nScrutiny over Trump's China ties beganeven before he entered the White House. During his 2016 campaign, Trump became the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to disclose his tax returns—a move that was further criticized after the House Ways and Means Committee published nearly 6,000 pages of records showing Trump's extensive commercial interests in China.\n\nThose tax records, released at the end of last year, showed that China is one of three foreign nations where Trump maintains a bank account. Although the documents did not show clear signs of illegality, they raised skepticism over Trump's reluctance to disclose, even as he painted Biden, who he nicknamed \"China Joe,\" as soft on China.\n\nDocuments released by the Democratic-controlled House last year showed that China was among six foreign governments that spent a total of more than $750,000 at Trump's hotel in Washington in 2017 and 2019 while \"seeking to influence American foreign policy.\"\n\n\"Other documents obtained by the committee indicate that the Trump Hotel may have sought business from both China and Russia around this time, despite the Trump Organization's promise not to enter into any foreign deals while Mr. Trump was president,\" former RepresentativeCarolyn Maloney, the then-chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform, said in November.\n\nThe former president and his daughter Ivanka were also the subjects of scrutiny in 2018 when the Chinese government granted 18 trademarks to companies linked to the father and daughter. The approvals, while applied for in 2016, raised concerns over conflicts of interest between Beijing and the White House.\n\nEven before his first run for the White House, Trump spent a decade pursuing projects in China, forging a partnership with the government-controlled Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\n\nWhile Trump has clai..."}

(AP Photo/Becky Bohrer)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Monday it is approving a huge oil-drilling project on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope, a majorenvironmental decisionby President Joe Biden that drewquick condemnationas flying in the face of his pledges to slow climate change.\n\nThe announcementcame a day after the administration, in a move in the other direction toward conservation, said it would bar or limit drilling in some other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe approval of ConocoPhillips’ big Willow drilling project by the Bureau of Land Management will allow three drill sites including up to 199 total wells. Two other drill sites proposed for the project will be denied. ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance called the order “the right decision for Alaska and our nation.”\n\nThe Houston-based company will relinquish rights to about 68,000 acres of existing leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.\n\nThe order, one of the most significant of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s tenure, was not signed by her but rather by her deputy, Tommy Beaudreau, who grew up in Alaska and briefed state lawmakers on the project Monday. Haaland was notably silent on the project, which she had opposed as a New Mexico congresswoman before becoming Interior secretary two years ago,until releasing a video Monday evening.\n\nShe described Willow as “a difficult and complex issue that was inherited” from earlier administrations. Because ConocoPhillips has held leases in the area for decades, Haaland said officials “had limited decision space” to block the project but focused on minimizing its footprint.\n\nHaaland defended the Biden administration’s record on climate change, saying, “I am confident that we are on the right path, even if it’s not always a straight line.”\n\nClimate activists remained outraged that Biden approved the project, which they say puts his climate legacy at risk. Allowing the drilling plan to go forward marks a major breach of Biden’scampaign promise to stop new oil drilling on federal lands,they say.\n\nMonday’s announcement is not likely to be the last word, with litigation expected from environmental groups.\n\nThe Willow project could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day, create up to 2,500 jobs during construction and 300 long-term jobs, and generate billions of dollars in royalties and tax revenues for the federal, state and local governments, the company said.\n\nThe project, located in the federally designated National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, enjoyswidespread political supportin the state. Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation met with Biden and his advisers in early March to plead their case for the project, and Alaska Native state lawmakers recently met with Haaland to urge support.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Monday the decision was “very good news for the country.”\n\n“Not only will this mean jobs and revenue for Alaska, it will be resources that are needed for the country and for our friends and allies,” Murkowski said. “The administration listened to Alaska voices..."}

Khalil’s lawyers filed his claim Thursday, alleging he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and wrongly labeled as an anti-semite as the Trump administration sought to remove him from the country.(RELATED: One Of El Salvador’s ‘Most Wanted’ Nabbed In America’s Heartland)\n\n“I cannot describe the pain of that night,” Khalil said to the AP, speaking of his time in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. “This is something I will never forgive.”\n\nKhalil reportedly plans to share any settlement money with other anti-Israel activists who’ve been targeted by the Trump administration. He also says he’d accept a formal apology and reforms to the White House’s deportation policies in lieu of a multi-million dollar settlement.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK – JUNE 22: Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was released from ICE detention, and his wife Noor Abdalla speak at a rally on the steps of Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan on June 22, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nThe lawsuit targets ICE, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and also the State Department.\n\nThe Trump administration — which has long argued that Khalil fomented the harassment of Jews on campusand conductedpro-Hamas activities — ripped his claims in response to the newly filed lawsuit.\n\n“Mahmoud Khalil’s claim that DHS officials branded him as an antisemite and terrorized him and his family is absurd,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “It was Khalil who terrorized Jewish students on campus.”\n\n“He ‘branded’ himself as antisemite through his own hateful behavior and rhetoric,” McLaughlin said, adding that it’s a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the U.S. “The Trump Administration acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil, as it does with any alien who advocates for violence, glorifies and supports terrorists, harasses Jews, and damages property.”\n\nAmid the Israel-Hamas war, major U.S. universities in 2024 becameoverrunwith leftist student protesters sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.

The increase broke a string of four straight three-quarter point hikes, the most aggressive policy moves since the early 1980s.\n\nAlong with the increase came an indication that officials expect to keep rates higher through next year, with no reductions until 2024. Theexpected \"terminal rate,\"or point where officials expect to end the rate hikes, was put at 5.1%, according to the FOMC's \"dot plot\" of individual members' expectations.\n\nInvestors initially reacted negatively to the expectation that rates may stay higher for longer, andstocks gave up earlier gains. Duringa news conference, ChairmanJerome Powellsaid it was important to keep up the fight against inflation so that the expectation of higher prices does not become entrenched.\n\n\"Inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases,\" the chair said at his post-meeting news conference. \"But it will take substantially more evidence to have confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.\"\n\nThe new level marks the highest the fed funds rate has been since December 2007, just ahead of the global financial crisis and as the Fed was loosening policy aggressively to combat what would turn into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nThis time around, the Fed is raising rates into what is expected to be a moribund economy in 2023.\n\nMembers penciled in increases for the funds rate until it hits a median level of 5.1% next year, equivalent to a target range of 5%-5.25. At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of monetary policy tightening to make its way through the economy.\n\nThe consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%.\n\nHowever, there was a fairly wide dispersion in the outlook for future years, indicating that members are uncertain about what is ahead for an economy dealing withthe worst inflation it has seen since the early 1980s.\n\nThe newest dot plot featured multiple members seeing rates heading considerably higher than the median point for 2023 and 2024. For 2023, seven of the 19 committee members – voters and nonvoters included – saw rates rising above 5.25%. Similarly, there were seven members who saw rates higher than the median 4.1% in 2024.\n\nTheFOMC policy statement, approved unanimously, was virtually unchanged from November's meeting. Some observers had expected the Fed to alter language that it sees \"ongoing increases\" ahead to something less committal, but that phrase remained in the statement.\n\nFed officials believe raising rates helps take money out the economy, reducing demand and ultimately pulling prices lower after inflation spiked to its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nThe FOMC lowered its growth targets for 2023, putting expected GDP gains at just 0.5%, barely above what would be considered a recession. The GDP outlook for this year also was put at 0.5%. In the September projections, the committee expected 0.2% growth this year and 1.2% next.\n\nThe committee also raised its median estimate for its favored core inflation measure to 4.8% for 2022, up 0.3 percentage point from the September outlook. Members slightly lowered their unemployment rate outlook for this year and bumped it a bit higher for the ensuing years.\n\nThe rate hike follows consecutive reports showing progress in the inflation fight.\n\nThe Labor Department reported Tuesday that theconsumer price index rose just 0.1%in November, a smaller increase than expected as the 12-month rate dropped to 7.1%. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI rate was at 6%. Both measures were the lowest since December 2021. A level the Fed puts more weight on, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, fell to a 5% annual rate in October.\n\nHowever, all of those readings remain well above the Fed's 2% target. Officials have stressed the need to see consistent declines in inflation and have warned against relying too much on trends over just a few months.\n\nPowell said the recent news was welcome but he still sees services inflation as too high.\n\n\"There's an expectation really that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so we'll have to stay at it,\" he said. \"We may have to raise rates higher to get where we want to go.\"\n\nCentral bankers still feel they have leeway to raise rates, as hiring remains strong and consumers, who drive abou..."}

Videos from local media showed a woman shouting \"The people will not forget.\"\n\nThree other people were arrested, including a 24-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman for allegedly attacking police officers and disorderly conduct, and a 23-year-old man on assault charges for allegedly attacking two security guards. Police told VOA the two men arrested were a Swiss and a Japanese national.\n\nFive other people were taken in for questioning over suspicion of disrupting public peace, but have been released, police said.\n\nOfficers led away an elderly man who had held up two handwritten posters listing democracy movements in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan alongside a poem commemorating June 4. The police action came even though he folded his papers after being warned he would be arrested for “disorderly conduct,” according to a French news agency reporter who tweeted about the incident.\n\nPolice told VOA they could not immediately provide information about this case, but he was reportedly released later.\n\nSeparately, diplomats from Western countries were seen walking outside the park on Tuesday evening, followed by throngs of press, according to Hong Kong Free Press.\n\nAhead of the anniversary, police detained performance artist Sanmu Chen in Causeway Bay, the busy Hong Kong shopping district where the park is located.\n\nBefore officers approached him, Chen wrote the Chinese characters “8964,” which refer to the date of the crackdown, with his finger in the air. He also mimed the Chinese traditional tomb sweeping ritual of pouring wine onto the ground to mourn the dead, according to local mediaHong Kong Free Press.\n\nHe was released the same night, Hong Kong police told VOA.\n\nLocal media reported several other people, including an activist who shouted, \"People will not forget,\" were also taken away, while police searched and questioned a woman whose phone flashlight was turned on.\n\nIn the past week, eight people were arrested for allegedly posting “seditious” messages, reports say.\n\nFor years, the vigil in Victoria Park drew thousands of participants. At its height, 500,000 people gathered in remembrance of the crackdown, making Hong Kong the only place in China where June 4 commemorations could be held. For a time, it was also the world’s largest commemorative Tiananmen Square event.\n\nThe vigils, however, disappeared after Beijing imposed its 2020 national security law on Hong Kong in response to widespread and sometimes violent 2019 protests over a later-rescinded extradition bill. The measure would have allowed authorities to send suspected financial criminals to the mainland for trial.\n\nThe 2020 law criminalizes secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces and terrorism. While the government credits it with restoring order, critics say it has curtailed Hong Kong’s freedoms, including the right to hold events like the vigil, that last major one of which was held in 2019.\n\n2024 law\n\nPlanners of past vigils tell VOA that authorities remain worried large-scale events could still be used as a platform for broader protest. The government appears to have confirmed those concerns with this year’s passage of Article 23, a domestic security measure that expands on the national security law, criminalizing and expanding penalties for offenses including sedition, secession and subversion.\n\nAddressing reporters on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said “different people may use different excuses to hide their intentions.”\n\n“It’s important we all bear that in mind, to be on guard all the time against attempts to cause trouble to Hong Kong, particularly disturbing public peace,” he said.\n\nOne-time vigil organizer Richard Tsoi, a member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, said Article 23 makes even small commemorations riskier.\n\n“Now with Article 23, the penalty is higher … so the risk is higher,” said Tsoi, who served eight months in prison after defying the government’s ban on holding the vigil in 2020. The group disbanded the following year.\n\nSome people, however, are commemorating privately. One activist posted a picture online of a wood..."}

It marks the seventh consecutive rate increase this year and places interest rates in firmly restrictive territory. While the rate hike is slightly smaller than the 75-basis-point increases approved at the past four meetings, it is still large by historical standards.\n\nIn addition to the large rate hike, Fed officials laid out an aggressive path of rate increases for next year. New economic projections released after the two-day meeting show policymakers expect rates to rise to 5.1% in 2023, a far higher level than the 4.6% rate officials last projected in September, according to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) dot plot of individual members' expectations.\n\n\"The committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,\" the FOMC said in its statement.\n\nINFLATION EASES MORE THAN EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER TO 7.1%, BUT CONSUMER PRICES REMAIN ELEVATED\n\nThe quarterly forecasts indicate the U.S. central bank will not cut interest rates until 2024, to a rate of about 4.1%.\n\nOfficials also indicated that economic growth will slow sharply next year and that unemployment will march substantially higher to a rate of 4.6% as rates hikes bring the U.S. to the brink of arecession. The Fed expects the jobless rate to remain elevated in 2024 and 2025 as steeper rates continue to take their toll by pushing up borrowing costs.\n\nTHE FED'S WAR ON INFLATION COULD COST 1M JOBS\n\nStocks fell after the Fed decision as investors weighed the hawkish projections.\n\nThe rate hike decision and the latest economic projections underscore just how committed the Fed is to wrestling high inflation under control, despite early evidence thatconsumer prices may have peakedearlier this year. New government data released on Tuesday showed that the consumer price index rose just 0.1% in November from the previous month and 7.1% on an annual basis — far less than economists expected.\n\nStill, inflation remains about three times above its pre-pandemic average and far higher than the Fed's 2% target.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attends a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 2, 2022.(Liu Jie/Xinhua via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nNOVEMBER INFLATION BREAKDOWN: WHERE ARE PRICES RISING THE FASTEST?\n\nA growing number of Wall Street economists anticipate the Fed's actions will tip the economy into a recession next year. Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.\n\nStill,Fed Chair Jerome Powellpushed back against that expectation during his post-meeting press conference, suggesting that lower inflation prints could boost the odds of a soft landing — the sweet spot between curbing inflation without flatlining growth.\n\n\"To the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway,\" he said. \"But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time could certainly make it more possible.

Jake Ellzey will head to Congress after defeating Trump-endorsed Susan Wright in a runoff featuring two GOP candidates.\n\nVoters in North Texas delivered an upset Tuesday, picking GOP state Rep. Jake Ellzey to fill a vacant House seat over a candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump.  | Ellzey/Facebook\n\nVoters in North Texas delivered an upset Tuesday, picking GOP state Rep. Jake Ellzey to fill a vacant House seat over a candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nEllzey beat fellow Republican Susan Wright, the widow of former Rep. Ron Wright, 53 percent to 47 percent, when the Associated Press called the low-turnout, Republican-vs.-Republican runoff. Though Ellzey was better funded, Wright leaned heavily on her backing from the former president, who often plays kingmaker in Republican primaries.\n\nTrump crashed into the race during the first round of voting in May, tapping Wright out of a crowded all-party primary and turning the contest into an early test of his post-presidency clout. He held two tele-town halls for her and taped a robocall for her, making the loss more painful.\n\nBut in his victory speech, Ellzey tried to downplay any tension and hinted at bright odds for the GOP.\n\n“It’s essential that we get this right,” he said. “It’s essential that we do it as Americans united, instead of Americans divided; Republicans united instead of Republicans divided, so once we take back the House and Senate in ’22 and take back the White House in 2024, we take back our country.”\n\nThe district, which spans the southern suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth region, used to be a GOP stronghold but has trended more competitive in recent years. Trump carried the district by just 3 points in 2020, after winning by a dozen in 2016.\n\nBut Democrats failed to capitalize on the fast-changing nature of the district. Their top vote-getter in May just barely missed the second runoff slot to Ellzey, who received nearly 14 percent of the vote. Wright led the pack with 19 percent.\n\nIt’s possible Ellzey benefited from Democratic voters who participated in the runoff to rebuff Trump. Though the runoff was between two Republican candidates, it was a special election open to all voters in the district.\n\nOne outcome that was certain regardless of which Republican won: Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have just three votes to spare on any bill once Ellzey is sworn in.\n\nWright began the runoff with several key advantages. She enjoyed high name ID in the district that her husband, Ron Wright, first won in 2018. Both were also active in local politics in Tarrant County. She also had the support of the anti-tax Club for Growth, which has spent nearly $1.2 million to boost her.\n\nBut Ellzey outraised her throughout the campaign, bringing in $1.7 million by early July, compared to Wright’s $740,000. He also notched some notable endorsements of his own from former Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas). A Navy veteran, Ellzey ran heavily on his military background.\n\nAnd while he’s certainly no anti-Trump Republican, he tied himself less closely to the president than his rival.\n\nWright’s defeat is a black eye for Trump, who made the race one of his first post-presidential forays — and the Club, which hopes to replicate the partnership with the president in other primaries this cycle.\n\nTrump’s influence will be put to the test again next week in Ohio where a slew of Republicans are vying to fill the Columbus-area seat of former Rep. Steve Stivers, who left Congress to run his state’s Chamber of Commerce. Trump is backing Republican Mike Carey in that race, though some of his allies have backed other candidates. Stivers threw his backing behind state Rep. Jeff LaRe.\n\nWright would have been the second widow this cycle to follow a deceased husband into Congress. Now-Rep. Julia Letlow won a special for the seat of her spouse, who died before he could be sworn in. She also would havebrought the numberof women in the GOP conference to 32.\n\nLoading\n\nYou will now start receiving email updates\n\nPlease check your inbox for a confirmation email\n\nYou are already subscribed\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nYour guide to Donald Trump’s unprecedented overhaul of the federal government.\n\nBy signing up, you acknowledge and agree to ourPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Service.

And it’s a risk that we’re working on the price cap to try to address,” Yellen told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” when asked if Americans should be worried about gas prices rising again later this year.\n\n“This winter, the European Union will cease, for the most part, buying Russian oil. And, in addition, they will ban the provision of services that enable Russia to ship oil by tanker. And it is possible that that could cause a spike in oil prices,” she added.\n\nYellen continued: “Our price cap proposal is designed to both lower Russian revenues that they use to support their economy and fight this illegal war, while also maintaining Russian oil supplies that will help to hold down global oil prices. So I believe this is something that can be essential, and it’s something that we’re trying to put in place to avoid a future spike in oil prices.\n\nRelated articleG7 countries agree to cap the price of Russian oil\n\nThe secretary’s comments could help fuel fears that gas prices will spike again afterthey began sinking last month,providing relief to inflation-weary consumers and an economy mired in a slowdown. The steady decline in prices has been driven by multiple factors, including recession fears that have knocked down oil prices and the fact that some Americans cut back on driving when gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon.\n\nEarlier this month,finance ministers from the G7 group of countries– the US, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom – said they would ban the provision of “services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally” above the price cap. That could block insurance cover or finance for oil shipments.\n\nThe maximum price would be set by “a broad coalition” of countries, they said in a joint statement. It would take effect alongside the European Union’s next batch of sanctions, which include a ban on seaborne imports of Russian oil starting in early December.\n\nYellen on Sunday also underscored her faith in the Federal Reserve to determine how best to avoid an economic recession, but acknowledged a potential recession is “a risk when the Fed is tightening monetary policy to redress inflation, so it’s certainly a risk that we’re monitoring.”\n\n“We’re seeing some slowdown in growth, but that’s natural,” she told Bash, noting the bad shape of the economy President Joe Biden inherited in 2021.\n\nShe added that despite higher food and energy prices, “We’ve got a good, strong labor market, and I believe it’s possible to maintain that.”\n\nYellen stressed that she’s optimistic about the economy and emphasized that the US is not in a recession. In response to high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates four times so far in 2022 andis likely to raise rates again this year.\n\nCNN’s Alex Stambaugh, Julia Horowitz, Michelle Toh and Matt Egan contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Biden Tells Governors No Federal Solution Pandemic Pledges Support States", "output": "PresidentJoe Bidenon Monday pledged to support governors struggling with the omicron variant of Covid-19,  but acknowledged the states will need to take the lead in controlling the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking just before a meeting with some of the nation's governors, Biden said: \"There is no federal solution. This gets solved at a state level.\"\n\nThose comments represent one of the most explicit acknowledgements to date from the Biden administration that it will need help from state and local governments in its efforts to curb the spread ofCovid-19.\n\nThe president may be concerned that federal initiatives to contain the virus can't be effective without states' help. The comments could also be an attempt to put added pressure on governors to take a greater role in trying to control the disease.\n\nAfter his remarks, Biden took one question about whether he supports revised recommendations for shortened quarantine periods.\n\n\"I rely on my medical team. I get a recommendation, I follow it,\" he said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently edited itsrecommendations for people who may have been exposedto the virus. Instead of the standard 14-day quarantine it had recommended, the CDC says that suspected exposures should result in a quarantine of 10 or seven days based on test results and symptoms.\n\nThe omicron variant poses a multifaceted threat to Biden, who campaigned on the federal government's ability to curbthe pandemic. The president on Monday reiterated some of the promises he made last week, including the federal government's purchase of 500 million rapid coronavirus tests.\n\n\"My message to the governors is simple: if you need something, say something,\" he said. \"We're going to have your back any way we can.\"\n\nThe administration plans to distribute the tests free to Americans, support more vaccination and testing sites, and deploy 1,000 military medical professionals to augment hospital staff nationwide.\n\nBut the virus's ability to mutate, spread and occasionally lead to positive cases among those who have received a vaccine has made the administration's promise to slow the disease more difficult. The virus and vaccine have become politicized. Many Americans, especially those supportive of former President Donald Trump, refuse to be vaccinated.\n\nReflecting differences in attitude toward the virus and public safety priorities nationwide, governors' responses to the Biden administration's efforts have been mixed.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican,issued an executive order inOctober prohibiting any entity, including private businesses,from imposing Covid-19 vaccination requirementson employees or customers. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, thought to be a 2024 Republican presidential contender, has in recent months broken away from federal public health guidance and curtailed mask and vaccine mandates.\n\nThe Biden administration has for weeks stressed that Americans should take extra care during the 2021 holiday season to protect their families from the spread of the disease.\n\nThe president's remarks came as Covid-19 cases surged over the Christmas holiday weekend.\n\nThe highly infectious omicron variant has in the past week caused a handful of states, including New Jersey and New York, to report more coronavirus cases than in any other seven-day period during the pandemic.\n\nWhile early signs suggest the variant may cause more mild symptoms, health experts urge rigorous public safety protocols and say the variant's rapid spread could strain the U.S. hospital system and lead to more deaths.\n\n\"Every day it goes up and up. The last weekly average was about 150,000 and it likely will go much higher,\" U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. AnthonyFauci said Sunday on the ABC program \"This Week.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, before the holiday weekend disrupted Covid trackers, the seven-day national average of new daily cases surpassed 176,000, a 44% increase over the past 14 days. Deaths also rose during that time, to a seven-day average of 1,213 from 1,103.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Imports from many countries had previously been subject to a baseline 10% import duty after Trump paused higher rates announced in early April.\n\nBut since then, Trump has frequently modified his tariff plan, slapping some countries with much higher rates, including 50% for goods fromBrazil, 39% from Switzerland, 35% fromCanadaand 25% from India. He announced on Aug. 6 aseparate, 25% tariffon Indian goods to be imposed in 21 days over the South Asian country's purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT!,\" Trump said on Truth Social just ahead of the deadline. \"BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"\n\nEight major trading partners accounting for about 40% of U.S. trade flows have reached framework deals for trade and investment concessions to Trump, including the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, reducing their base tariff rates to 15%.\n\nBritain won a 10% rate, while Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines secured rate reductions to 19% or 20%.\n\n\"For those countries, it's less-bad news,\" said William Reinsch, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"There'll be some supply chain rearrangement. There'll be a new equilibrium. Prices here will go up, but it'll take a while for that to show up in a major way,\" Reinsch said.\n\nCountries with punishingly high duties, such as India and Canada, \"will continue to scramble around trying to fix this,\" he added.\n\nTrump's order has specified that any goods determined to have been transshipped from a third country to evade higher U.S. tariffs will be subject to an additional 40% import duty, but his administration has released few details on how these goods would be identified or the provision enforced.\n\nTrump's July 31tariff orderimposed duties above 10% on 67 trading partners, while the rate was kept at 10% for those not listed. These import taxes are one part of a multilayered tariff strategy that includes national security-based sectoral tariffs onsemiconductors,pharmaceuticals, autos, steel, aluminum, copper, lumber, and other goods.\n\nTrump said on Aug. 6 that the microchip duties could reach 100%.\n\nChina is on a separate tariff track and will face a potential tariff increase on Aug. 12 unless Trump approves an extension of a prior truce after talks last week in Sweden. He has said he may impose additional tariffs on China's purchases of Russian oil as he seeks to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has touted the vast increase in federal revenues from his import tax collections, which are ultimately paid by companies importing the goods and consumers of end products.\n\nThe higher rates will add to the total, which reached a record $27 billion in June. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that U.S. tariff revenues could top $300 billion a year.\n\nThe move will drive average U.S. tariff rates to around 20%, the highest in a century and up from 2.5% when Trump took office in January, the Atlantic Institute estimates.Commerce Department datareleased last week showed more evidence that tariffs began driving up U.S. prices in June, including for home furnishings and durable household equipment, recreational goods, and motor vehicles.\n\nCosts from Trump's tariff war are mounting for a wide swath of companies, including bellwethers Caterpillar, Marriott, Molson Coors, and Yum Brands. All told, global companies that have reported earnings so far this quarter are looking at a hit of around $15 billion to profits in 2025, Reuters'global tariff trackershows.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Lincoln Feast)"}

Average hourly earnings meanwhile rose by 11 cents to $27.48. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by a total of 84 cents, or about 3.2 percent.\n\nAlthough experts categorized the gains as unsustainable, they also said it meant an economic recession may not occur as soon as once believed.\n\n\"The U.S. economy will eventually fall into recession, maybe as soon as next year, but the December employment report indicates that this isn’t going to happen anytime soon,\" said David Berson, the chief economist at Nationwide.\n\nJobs numbers come on the heels of a report Thursday frompayroll processing firm ADP, which revealed the private sector added 271,000 jobs in December, soaring past analysts’ expectations of 178,000 jobs.\n\nAnalysts anticipated that unemployment would hold steady at 3.7 percent, the lowest number in nearly 50 years, while forecasting the creation of 177,000 jobs, according to economists polled by Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters).\n\nHowever, the rise in the unemployment rate likely stemmed from a jump in the labor force participation rate -- not a shortage in new jobs -- because at 63.1 percent, it's at the highest level in more than a year, tied for the highest rate since 2013.\n\nThe stronger-than-expected number -- which was applauded by President Trump on Twitter -- comes in the midst of concerns about a softeningeconomy.\n\nOn Wednesday, after Apple cut its quarterly revenue estimates by billions of dollars, shares of the iPhone maker plummeted.

They signaled a slower pace of gradual rate hikes in 2019, expecting to hit neutral by the end of the year.\n\n\"What the Fed actually will do with respect to policy will depend on ongoing economic data, and today’s strong employment report points to more near-term tightening,\" Berson said. \"But if future data show slowing, a 'data dependent' Fed will take that into consideration.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

He installed solar panels on the White House, donned a cardigan sweater to stay warm and took steps to boost domestic oil production.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has again upended global energy supplies, threatening to raise gas prices that are alreadyhigher than everin California. The U.S. oil industrywantsPresident Biden to ease restrictions on drilling, and Europe has already startedimportingmore fossil fuel from the United States to reduce its dependence on Russian supplies.\n\nBut doubling down on oil and natural gas isn’t the answer, some security experts say — and neither is energy independence.\n\nThe war in Europe adds to the urgency of transitioning to clean energy sources such as solar and wind power that are harder for bad actors such as Russia to disrupt, those experts say. The conflict also highlights the importance of the U.S., the European Union and other allies working together to confront the climate crisis while taking global security into account.\n\n“There’s been a lot of concern about dependence on Russian [natural] gas, and whether that inhibits countries’ ability to stand up to Russia,” said Erin Sikorsky, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Climate and Security. “The more that countries can wean themselves off oil and gas and move toward renewables, the more independence they have in terms of action.”\n\nGet our Boiling Point newsletter for the latest on the power sector, water wars and more — and what they mean for California.\n\nBy continuing, you agree to ourTerms of Serviceand ourPrivacy Policy.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that climate change poses a major national security threat, with the Defense Department and other federal officialswarning last yearthat worsening climate-fueled hazards are likely to drive a surge in global migration, stoking political instability. That helps explain why the U.S. Army released itsfirst-ever climate strategythis month, setting a goal of slashing its planet-warming emissions in half and powering all bases with climate-friendly electricity by 2030.\n\nSikorsky pointed out that Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III hascalledChina the “pacing threat” for the U.S., meaning it poses greater systemic challenges than any other nation. The climate emergency, Sikorsky said, is America’s “shaping threat.”\n\n“It is shaping everything in the background now that the United States is dealing with,” she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nA United Nations report on the growth of extreme wildfires worldwide suggests California can do more to increase fire resiliency.\n\nEven before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched hisattack on Ukrainethis week, European nations were making plans to cut their reliance on energy exports from Russia. The country supplies more than one-quarter of Europe’s oil and nearly 40% of its natural gas, a different planet-warming fuel used for heating and electricity generation.\n\nBut Russian aggression has sped up the EU’s plans. European officials areexpectedto release a strategy next week for reducing the continent’s use of fossil fuels by 40% over eight years and ramping up non-polluting energy sources.\n\nIt’s a plan designed to slow the climate crisis, which iswreaking havoc around the worldby exacerbating wildfires, floods, droughts and heat waves. But cutting back on fossil fuels would also help to limit Russia’s geopolitical influence.\n\nUC Berkeley energy professor Daniel Kammen — who previously served as science envoy for then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry — lamented that Europe “has clearly needed higher motivations than climate change to cut the Gordian gas knot with Russia.” But if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushes the EU to act, he said, it could be a silver lining to an otherwise tragic situation.\n\n“For all we talk abouthow inexpensive renewables are,and how quickly energy storage is coming down in price, that hasn’t been enough when it appears that ‘just’ the climate is at stake,” Kammen said. “Now European sovereignty is at stake.”\n\nStill, there’s no guarantee Europe will follow through on its latest climate commitments. Even if the geopolitical crisis underscores the benefits of shifting to renewable energy, it could also distract global leaders from the longer-term climate crisis.\n\nAnd in the meantime, one of Europe’s strategies for dealing with constrained Russian gas supplies and rising prices during the last few months has beenimporting more liquefied natural gasfrom the United States. It’s an option made possible by fracking, which opened up “shale plays” in regionssuch as west Texasand made America the world’s largest oil and natural gas producer.\n\n“Putin hates U.S. shale because of the influence it gives the U.S. and the world, and the flexibility it gives us,” said Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chair o..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Energy Alaskas Willow Oil Drilling Project Unites Politicians Worries Environmentalists", "output": "As elected Iñupiat leaders and lifelong residents of Alaska’s North Slope, we are fiercely proud of our ancestors and their quest for self-determination. Despite living in the most extreme climate in the United States, the Iñupiat have sustained our communities while staying true to our cultural values and traditional subsistence way of living.\n\nYet when it comes to Alaska’s proposed Willow Project, the voices of the people whose ancestral homeland is most impacted have largely been ignored.\n\nWe know our lands and our communities better than anyone, and we know that resource development and our subsistence way of life are not mutually exclusive. Responsible resource development with the inclusion and engagement of North Slope Iñupiat has taken place for over 50 years. It exemplifies a positive model of cultural, economic and ecological interdependence.\n\nOur nation’s past and present have relied on responsible natural resource development, and the sustainability of our Alaska Native communities on the North Slope requires it to be a part of our future.\n\nLocated in the northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), the Willow Project has widespread support across Alaska — especially from the entities that represent the Iñupiat people of the North Slope. Its potential economic benefits would represent a once-in-a-lifetime investment in our region and state, not to mention the entire country.\n\nWillow is expected to generate $1.25 billion in taxes for the North Slope Borough — funding that will be used to provide basic services like education, fire protection, law enforcement and more. The project is also expected to add more than $2.5 billion to the NPR-A Impact Mitigation Grant Program. Our respective cities rely on revenues from this program to fund projects that provide long-term quality-of-life improvements in our communities.\n\nThe city of Wainwright has been fortunate to receive NPR-A Impact Mitigation funding since 1994 to support local government operations, including local government and municipal administration, cultural and recreational activities, staff and facilities. Funds since 2007 have gone toward city’s youth program, including providing a safe, supportive environment for youth as well as recreational and cultural activities. Our city park would not be here if not for NPR-A funding, nor would the city’s lagoon boat ramp, used by residents for subsistence activities.\n\nWe anticipate future NPR-A grant funding will continue to support important local government and youth programs for the city and, in the long term, will play a critical role in funding a new recreation center for youth and community programs, a replacement of the aging Wainwright City Hall and other important community facilities.\n\nUtqiaġvik is considered the hub of the North Slope, home to 5,000 residents as well as the regional tribal college, hospital and borough government. Funding from NPR-A has already covered fire and alarm security systems in municipal buildings, much-needed renovations to our community recreational center, and a variety of subsistence and recreational operations. Grant funding will help us design a community soup kitchen to ensure our neighbors do not go hungry in winter. We have also been able to purchase equipment to dig graves in year-round permafrost — critical because our city does not have enough freezers to keep the deceased, requiring us to bury a loved one within days even in the dead of winter.\n\nThese are not basic services Utqiaġvik takes for granted. We need a stable, healthy economy to continue receiving them.\n\nHere in the North Slope, we straddle the line of a traditional subsistence way of living and the economic realities of the modern world.

Powers was traded two years later for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, in an exchange on a fog-shrouded bridge between West and East Berlin.\n\nThe story behind the dramatic exchange was told in Steven Spielberg's 2015 historical drama \"Bridge of Spies.\"\n\nAnother exchange saw Nicholas Daniloff, an American journalist who was imprisoned in Moscow in 1986, released that same year in a swap with Soviet physicist Gennadi Zakharov, who had been arrested on espionage charges in New York.\n\nThe largest U.S.-Russian spy swap since the Cold Warcame in 2010when 10 Russian agents, includingAnna Chapman, were exchanged for four Russians accused of spying for the West — among themSergei Skripal, who was later poisoned with a nerve agent in the United Kingdom. The British governmentblamedMoscow for the poisoning, which it has denied.U.S.-Russia relations have spiraled over the war in Ukraine, and as the conflict marches toward a first anniversary in February, Smith said Griner's release would suggest the two countries are \"interested in managing the nature and extent of the conflict\" in order to \"prevent it from escalating to dangerous levels.\"\n\nStill, Thursday's prisoner swap comes at a time when Biden has said himself that the nuclear threat is at its highest in decades.\n\nBiden offered a candidwarning in Octoberthat the risk of nuclear “Armageddon” was the highest it has been for 60 years after Russian President Vladimir Putin issuedrenewed threats.\n\nSpeaking at a reception for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Biden said it was the first time since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis that there has been a “direct threat” of nuclear weapons being used, “if, in fact, things continue down the path they are going.”\n\n“We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis,” he said at the time.\n\nPutin has repeatedly used the threat of nuclear weapons throughout his presidency, and has renewed those threats as his military struggles in Ukraine. On Wednesday, the Russian leadersaid his nuclear arsenal was in fact deterring escalation of the war.\n\nAsked to pledge that Russia would not be the first to use such weapons, Putin suggested Moscow would not be able to use them at all if it agreed not to use them first and then came under a nuclear strike.\n\nWashington and Moscow have still been able to meet amid the threats, however. In mid-November, talks took place between the U.S. and Russia in Ankara, with a spokesperson for the White House’s National Security Councilconfirming reportsthat CIA Director William Burns was in the Turkish capital for talks with his Russian counterpart.\n\nSmith said a prisoner swap potentially \"tells us something about the willingness of Russia and the United States to sit down and at some point, not necessarily immediat..."}

Children's Covid casesremain disturbingly highwith 243,000 new infections during the week ended Sept. 9. — the second-highest number of kids' cases since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the most recent data from the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nThe data, which included more than 2,200 children, will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration and other health regulators \"as soon as possible,\" the companies said. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourlasaid last weekthe company could submit data on children ages 5 to 11 by the end of this month. If the FDA spends as much time reviewing the data for that age group as it did for 12- to 15-year-olds, the shots could be available in time for Halloween.\n\n\"Depending on how long the FDA takes to review the application, whether it's a four-week review or a six-week review, you could have a vaccine available to children as early as probably by the end of October\" or early November, Scott Gottlieb, a Pfizer board member and the former head of the FDA, told CNBC on Monday.\n\nThe companies tested a two-dose regimen of 10 micrograms — about a third the dosage used for teens and adults — administered three weeks apart. They said the shots were well tolerated and produced an immune response and side effects comparable to those seen in a study of people ages 16 to 25.\n\nCommon side effects for teens and adults include fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the Delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children,\" Bourla said in a press release that announced the results.\n\nThe companies didn't disclose many details about the trial, including whether any of the kids in the trial experienced myocarditis, a rare heart condition seen in a small number of adolescents and young adults.\n\nSo far, the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been cleared by the FDA for people as young as 12, whileModerna's andJohnson & Johnson's vaccines have been authorized for adults.\n\nThe FDA is expected to issue a decision sometime this week on which groups are eligible to get a third dose, or booster shot, of the Pfizer vaccine.

Economists had been expecting the rate to stay unchanged at 3.9% from April.\n\nThe increase came even though the labor force participation rate decreased to 62.5%, down 0.2 percentage point. The survey of households used to compute the unemployment rate showed that the level of people who reported holding jobs fell by 408,000.\n\n\"On the surface, [the report] was hot, but you've also got a bigger drop in household employment,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"For what it's worth, that tends to be a more accurate signal when you're at an inflection point in the economy. You can find weakness in the underlying numbers.\"\n\nA more encompassing unemployment figure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons held steady at 7.4%.\n\nThe household survey also showed that full-time workers declined by 625,000, while those holding part-time positions increased by 286,000.\n\nJob gains were concentrated in health care, government, and leisure and hospitality, consistent with recent trends. The three sectors respectively added 68,000, 43,000 and 42,000 positions. The three sectors accounted for more than half the gains.\n\nOther significant growth areas came in professional, scientific and technical services (32,000), social assistance (15,000), and retail (13,000).\n\nRegarding wages, average hourly earnings were higher than expected as well, rising 0.4% on the month and 4.1% from a year ago. The respective estimates were for increases of 0.3% and 3.9%.\n\nStock market futureslost ground while Treasury yields surged after the report.\n\n\"One step forward, two steps back. Today's data undermines the message that other recent economic data have been giving of a cooling U.S. economy, and slams the door shut on a July rate cut,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"Not only has jobs growth exploded again, but wage growth has also surprised to the upside, both moving in the opposite direction to what the Fed needs to begin easing policy.\"\n\nPrevious months' reports saw small revisions: The March gain dropped to 310,000, down 5,000, while April's saw a cut of 10,000 to 165,000.\n\nThe report comes with investors on edge over how long the Fed will hold its benchmark borrowing rate at the highest level in some 23 years. In recent weeks, policymakers have indicated a reluctance to cut anytime soon as inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target.\n\nThe report was \"certainly hawkish\" from the Fed's perspective, Sonders said, meaning that the data would make it less likely that the central bank will reduce rates anytime soon.\n\nFollowing the jobs report, traders in the fed funds futures market reduced the possibility of a cut in September to about 56%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure. That was down about 12 percentage points from Thursday. The market-implied probability of a second move lower in December fell to about a coin flip after being around 68% a day ago.\n\nThe Fed has not lowered rates since the early days of the Covid pandemic in 2020 and hiked 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023.

The company does not have any facilities in Russia, but the former Marine often travelled there.\n\nSince his first visit in 2006, Mr Whelan made a number of other trips to Russia and developed an in-depth knowledge of the country.\n\nIt was due to his knowledge of Russia that he had been asked to attend the wedding of a fellow former Marine in Moscow in December 2018, his brother David told the BBC's Newshour after his arrest.\n\n\"His experience of having already been to the Kremlin and walked around Red Square and navigating the metro, his friend felt Paul could assist a bunch of Americans who hadn't otherwise ever been to Moscow,\" David Whelan said.\n\nOn 28 December, however, he was arrested by Russia's FSB state security agency, which claimed he had been \"caught spying\" in Moscow. At the time, there were uncorroborated reports he had been caught receiving a digital storage device containing a list of intelligence officials.\n\nThere was also speculation over other possible motives for the arrest, which included a suggestion Mr Whelan was detained so he could be exchanged for Maria Butina - a Russian gun rights activist, who was jailed in the US in December 2018. She was deported back to Russia in October 2019.\n\nDavid Whelan, meanwhile, has dismissed the allegations as nonsense.\n\n\"I can't imagine how someone with a law enforcement background who is also a former US Marine, and who is now working in corporate security and is also aware of the risks of travel, would have broken any law let alone the law related to espionage,\" he said.\n\nMr Whelan's friends in Russia, some with military connections like him, have also rebutted the charges of spying, all telling the BBC the idea was laughable.\n\nIn court in Moscow, he was nervous at first - but soon began speaking out to call himself a political hostage and denounce a 'kangaroo court'.\n\nThe BBC's Sarah Rainsford has followed Mr Whelan's case from the very start and interviewed him multiple times.\n\nThe last time they spoke by phone from prison, he told her he felt \"abandoned\" and \"seriously betrayed\" by the US government.\n\nLeft behind in previous prisoner swaps, he had grown despondent. Life in prison was tough, with guards waking him up multiple times to check he hadn't escaped.\n\nStuck serving a 16-year sentence, Mr Whelan said his parents were elderly, his beloved dog had died and his life was \"slipping away\" while the US government looked for a deal.\n\n\"Now that's finally happened,\" Rainsford writ..."}

The notice also said the program is necessary to ensure the U.S. government is not financially liable if a visitor does not comply with the visitor’s visa terms.\n\n\"Aliens applying for visas as temporary visitors for business or pleasure and who are nationals of countries identified by the department as having high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or offering citizenship by investment, if thealien obtained citizenshipwith no residency requirement, may be subject to the pilot program,\" the notice read.\n\nSENATE REPUBLICAN AIMS TO TREAT VISA OVERSTAYERS LIKE ILLEGAL ENTRANTS IN RESPONSE TO COLORADO TERROR ATTACK\n\nOnce the program takes effect, the countries affected will be listed.\n\nThe notice also notes that the bond could be waived based on individual circumstances.\n\nCitizens of countries enrolled in the Visa Waiver Program, which provides for business travel or tourism for up to 90 days, will not be required to pay the bond.\n\nTRUMP STATE DEPT ANNOUNCES NEW STUDENT-VISA VETTING WILL BE ONGOING PROCESS, NOT ONE-TIME CHECK\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is working on new policies surrounding visas, including requiring up to a $15,000 bond from visa applicants coming from foreign countries.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nThere are 42 countries enrolled in the Visa Waiver Program, which includes countries from Europe and the Middle East.\n\nWhile visa bonds have been proposed in the past, they have never been implemented.\n\nReasons the bonds have never been implemented include potential misperceptions by the public, and the argument that the process of posting and discharging the bond could become burdensome.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital the Visa Bond Pilot is consistent with Executive Order 141598, which Trump signed to protect the American people from an invasion.\n\nThe spokesperson noted that the pilot reinforces the administration’s commitment to enforcing immigration laws in the U.S. and safeguarding national security.\n\nAs for the list of countries, it may be updated from time-to-time, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGreg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.\n\nStory tips and ideas can be sent to Greg.Wehner@Fox.com and on Twitter @GregWehner.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Whistleblower Says Facebook Puts Profits People Senate Hearing", "output": "The buck should stop with Zuck — but Facebook’s all-powerful CEO has faced no accountability as his social media behemoth has become a national security risk that’s harming children.\n\nAnd lawmakers had better do something about it, fast.\n\nThat was the urgent plea from whistleblower Frances Haugen, who blasted her ex-employer during Senate testimony on Tuesday, calling for government regulators to step in.\n\n“There are no similarly powerful companies that are as unilaterally controlled [as Facebook],”  said Haugen, a former Facebook employee who leaked thousands of internal documents to lawmakers and the Wall Street Journal. “The buck stops with Mark. There is no one currently holding Mark accountable but himself.”\n\n“As long as Facebook is operating in the dark, it is accountable to no one and it will continue to make choices that go against the common good,” she added, calling on the company to declare “moral bankruptcy.”\n\nMaterial leaked by Haugen showed that Facebook hasdownplayed Instagram’s negative effects on teens’ mental healthdespite damning internal research. Others showed thatthe company exempts popular users from some content moderation rulesand has failed to crack down on drug cartels and human traffickers.\n\n“The documents I have provided to Congress prove that Facebook has repeatedly misled the public,” said Haugen in testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee’s consumer protection subcommittee. “I came forward at great personal risk because I believe we still have time to act.”\n\nIn the face of Haugen’s revelations, Zuckerberg has appeared flippant. He has not commented on the whistleblower or the Journal’s articles beyond making a joke about a surfboard — and posted a video of himself going sailing on Sunday, the same day that Haugenrevealed her identity in an interview with “60 Minutes.”\n\n“Rather than taking responsibility and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) during the hearing.\n\nHaugen’s assertion came days after Facebook’s safety chiefAntigone Davis denied in a hearing with the same Senate subcommitteethat Zuckerberg has unilateral control over decisions at Facebook.\n\nDavis also downplayed the research leaked by Haugen, arguing that it did not establish a “causal” connection between Instagram and teen mental health issues.\n\n“This research is not a bombshell,” Davis insisted.\n\nUnder largely sympathetic questioning from Senators, Haugen painted Instagram as a uniquely harmful product for teens, arguing that its algorithm hooks teens by pushing addictive content that can foster mental health issues like eating disorders.\n\n“TikTok is about doing fun things with your friends, Snapchat is about faces and augmented reality, Reddit is about ideas,” she said. “But Instagram is about bodies, and about comparing lifestyles.”\n\nFacebook spokesperson Andy Stone tried to minimize Haugen’s testimony on Tuesday,writing on Twitterthat she “did not work on child safety or Instagram or research these issues and has no direct knowledge of the topic from her work at Facebook.”\n\nStone alsoshareda statement from Facebook’s director of policy communications Lena Pietsch saying Haugen had “testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question.”\n\nBut Haugen says her credibility as a whistleblower should be based on the fact that she leaked reams of Facebook documents from researchers who were working on child safety and Instagram — not just her word.\n\nSenators were chomping at the bit for regulation, repeatedly comparing Facebook to big tobacco — but it’s unclear exactly what form that regulation will take.\n\nHaugen said she would support rules requiring social media companies to display posts in chronological form, meaning the most recent posts are displayed first, rather than the current system of “engagement-based ranking” that she said maximizes extreme views and clickbait.\n\n“We don’t want computers deciding what we focus on,” she said.\n\nBut Haugen also pushed back against a push from bills from bipartisan lawmakers and anantirust case from the Federal Trade Commissionseeking to break up Facebook by making it sell properties like Instagram and WhatsApp. Haugen argued that breaking up Facebook wouldn’t change harmful algorithms.\n\nElsewhere during her three-hour testimony, Haugen raised national security concerns about her former employer.\n\n“Facebook’s consistent understaffing of the counterespionage, information operations and counterterrorism teams is a national security issue,” she said. “I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today.”\n\nIn response, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the committee may ask Haugen to testify again for a hearing specifically focused on national security.\n\nHaugen worked at Facebook from June 2019 to May 2020, reading and copying thousands of documents from the company’s internal document system, called “Workplace.” Those documents included the studies on misinformation..."}

Please see our Privacy Policy for more information.\n\nSomething you may have picked up on over the past two years is thatDonald Trumpis not a huge fan of the media, or how it has covered his presidency. That probably has to do with the fact that his time in the Oval Office has consisted of a 12-car pileup ofcorruption,greed,incompetence,spelling errors,hubris,lies,entitlement, andvariousuncategorizablebullshit. If you were responsible for the daily [insert catastrophic/mortifying/what-the-absolute-fuck incident here], you wouldn’t want to see it accurately covered, either! One way to deal with that would be for the president to simply ignore the coverage he doesn’t like and restrict his media consumption to the warm embrace ofThe Sean Hannity ShoworFox & Friends,where the hosts’ sole mandate is to bark and clap approvingly for anything Trump does. He has indeed done this to some extent, to the point that, as my colleagueGabriel Shermanreportedin January, Trump habitually calls hosts to give them feedback on their segments. “What he usually does is he’ll call after a show and say, ‘Ireallyenjoyed that,’” a former anchor told him. “The highest compliment is, ‘I really learned something.’ Then you know he got a new policy idea.”\n\nUnfortunately, there is still the issue of other people watching non-Fox programming, and getting the (entirely accurate) impression that Trump’s administration is a disaster of epic proportions. At present, it appears someone in the White House has convinced the president that he can’t “challenge” TV networks’ “licenses,” as he hasthreatenedto do at leasttwice, or to simply shut down all media outlets he doesn’t likevia executive order. So he’s had to come up with a Plan C:\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.\n\nAs it happens, the federal governmentfunds somethingcalled Voice of America, a news operation with an annual budget of $218.5 million that broadcasts to 236.6 million people worldwide andplays“a role in shaping impressions of the United States and its leaders in foreign countries,” having exclusively served foreign audiences until 2013,when it became available domestically. It’s not clear if Trump is unaware of this organization, or if he chose to write it off as an ineffective vehicle to disseminate propaganda about his work in Washington after VOA’s directorAmanda Bennettinsisted in January 2017 that her team would “absolutely” not be “manipulated by the Trump administration.” Clearly, though, the Supreme Leader of the United States is looking for something a little closer to the Russian or North Korean model of news-making.\n\nMore from Vanity Fair\n\nContact\n\n©2025Condé Nast.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Perspectives Media Bias And Ivermectin Misinformation", "output": "Sign up for the dailyCJR newsletter.\n\nLast week, KFOR, a local news outlet in Oklahoma, published a story that contained some terrifying information: so many people in the state were hospitalized due to overdoses of ivermectin—a drug originally designed for horses, which some anti-vaccine sourceshave promoted(incorrectly) as a defense against COVID-19—that there was no room in intensive-care units for other patients, including those with gunshot wounds.The storycontained quotes from an interview with Dr. Jason McElyea, a local physician, and was quickly picked up by a number of national outlets, includingRolling Stonemagazine, theGuardian,Newsweekmagazine, andBusiness Insider.A producer for MSNBC repeated the claim on Twitter (although shelater deleted it),as did the Rachel Maddow show.\n\nNot long afterward, the story started to spring some major holes.As detailed on Twitter by Drew Holden—a public-affairs consultant in Washington, DC, and former assistant to a Republican congressman—and by Scott Alexanderon his popular blog, Astral Codex Ten, the first sign that all was not right came with a statement from a large Oklahoma hospital,which said that there was no bed shortagedue to ivermectin overdoses, and that the doctor quoted in the KFOR report hadn’t worked there in months. Otherspointed out thatin his original interview with the Oklahoma news outlet, McElyea hadn’t said anything about ivermectin cases crowding out other patients, but that the initial story and subsequent coverage had linked separate comments aboutivermectin overdosesand scarce beds.\n\nThe episode caught fire with right-wing Twitter trolls and conservative commentators, who represented it asyet another example of the mainstream media’s tendency to willfully publish news stories to either make citizens of rural areas look stupid, or to overstate the risk or frequency of non-mainstream COVID treatments.Many pointed to the tweetfrom the Maddow account as evidence that no one fact-checks their statements any more, especially when they serve the purpose of making right-wing anti-vaxxers and COVID denialists look bad. Others used theRolling Stonestoryas an opportunity to revisit the magazine’s infamous 2014 investigative storyon an alleged rape at the University of Virginia, which collapsed after statements made by the single source it was based oncouldn’t be independently verified.\n\nICYMI:The reactive coverage of the Supreme Court and the Texas abortion law\n\nHowever, this alternate version of events, aimed at making the mainstream press look as derelict as possible, also left out some important facts. The statement that there had been no ivermectin cases came from a single Oklahoma hospital—and while McElyea wasn’t working at that particular hospital when he made his comments, hehadworked there previously, and works for an agency that provides services to various local hospitals. McElyea also stated in his original interview that there had been some ivermectin overdose cases in the hospitals he was familiar with, although he didn’t say these cases had taken ICU beds away from other patients. He has since told another Oklahoma news outlethe was misquotedby KFOR. A number of news outlets updated their coverage—Rolling Stoneadded anextensiveeditor’s note to its storyretracting the core point of the report—butthe KFOR storyremains online in its original form.\n\nAs Alexander noted, the KFOR story seemed designed totell everyone what they most wanted to hear. Anyone predisposed to think that rural residents of southern states are rubes prone to overdosing on horse medicine would find exactly what they were looking for; so would anyone who thought the media overplays or evenmanufactures “fake news”to fit a particular COVID narrative. As Derek Thompson, a writer for theAtlantic, argued, thetruth is likely somewhat more prosaic: that “journalism was always a mix of great, good, mediocre, and shitty work,” all of which is easy to find on the internet, and that the current cultural environment encourages “team picking,” or finding narratives that fit a specific world-view, even if they must be bent out of shape to do so.\n\nHere’s more on the news:\n\nOther notable stories:\n\nUpdate 09/28: Hot Pod will become the first subscription product for The Verge after being acquired by Vox Media.

Some candidates seek to prove their bona fides by embracing false claims about the 2020 election being stolen, precisely because they know that responsible opponents will be unwilling to do so. Too many campaigns revolve around the idea that candidates should be not just unyielding or combative but transgressive. When voters reward this behavior, it is imitated further.\n\nJust as cynically, Democrats — while professing alarm at claimed threats to democracy — have poured tens of millions of dollars into backing the most transgressive candidates, especially those who attended the January 6 “stop the steal” rally. The model is Harry Reid helping Sharron Angle beat Sue Lowden in 2010 and Claire McCaskill throwing financial support behind Todd Akin in 2012.\n\nDemocrats succeeded in elevating their preferred opponents in the Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Maryland governor’s races, and in helpingKari Lake win the nominationfor governor of Arizona, too. The tactic failed in the Colorado Senate race and the Nevada governor’s race. Dan Cox’s victory in Maryland likely gives away the governor’s mansion held by Larry Hogan and, with it, the last defense for Marylanders from unified Democratic control. J. B. Pritzker has likewise probably ensured his reelection by spending over $40 million to prevent Republicans from nominating Richard Irvin; if elected, Irvin would have become Illinois’s first African-American governor. Remember that the next time Democrats champion their own “historic” candidates.\n\nDemocrats were at it again this week in Michigan, successfully targeting freshman congressman Peter Meijer for the offense of voting to impeach Trump over January 6. So much for gratitude toward people who stood up in solidarity when House Democrats asked them to do so. In some cases — such as in Colorado, Michigan, and Illinois — Democratic spending was the bulk of the financial support for these Republicans.\n\nThe Democrats have forfeited any claim to themoral high groundand revealed the total insincerity of anything they say about democracy or about responsibility to put country over party. Democrats have never been much for holding their own accountable for stolen-election theories or other malfeasance, or for tolerating members of their party who take brave stands against the party line. But this is a new low. It’s true that the ultimate responsibility for nominating fringe candidates lies with Republican primary voters who are willing — even eager — to support them. But if Democrats truly believe that people such as Lake and Doug Mastriano are existential threats to democracy, the last thing they ought to be doing in a red-wave election year is helping to put them one step closer to power.\n\nFor Democrats, anything goes in seeking even a modest advantage in winning office. Every Democrat involved in these shenanigans richly deserves to lose. And Republican voters should pay more attention to who wants them to vote for these sorts of candidates. They do not have the interests of Republican voters, conservative causes, or American democracy at heart.\n\n© 2025 National Review\n\nNewsletters\n\n© 2025 National Review"}

(AP Photo/John Amis, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Marsha Appling-Nunez was showing the college students she teaches how to check online if they’re registered to vote when she made a troubling discovery. Despite being an active Georgia voter who had cast ballots in recent elections, she was no longer registered.\n\n“I was kind of shocked,” said Appling-Nunez, who moved from one Atlanta suburb to another in May and believed she had successfully changed her address on the voter rolls.\n\n“I’ve always voted. I try to not miss any elections, including local ones,” Appling-Nunez said.\n\nShe tried re-registering, but with about one month left before a November election that will decide a governor’s race and some competitive U.S. House races, Appling-Nunez’s application is one of over 53,000 sitting on hold with Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp’s office. And unlike Appling-Nunez, many people on that list — which is predominantly black, according to an analysis by The Associated Press — may not even know their voter registration has been held up.\n\nTuesday is Georgia’s deadline to register and be eligible to vote in the November General Election.\n\nKemp, who’s also the Republican candidate for governor, is in charge of elections and voter registration in Georgia.\n\nHis Democratic opponent, former state Rep. Stacey Abrams, and voting rights advocacy groups charge that Kemp is systematically using his office to suppress votes and tilt the election, and that his policies disproportionately affect black and minority voters.\n\nKemp denies it vehemently.\n\nBut through a process that Kemp calls voter roll maintenance and his opponents call voter roll purges, Kemp’s office has cancelled over 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012. Nearly 670,000 registrations were cancelled in 2017 alone.\n\nIn a recent television appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” Abrams called Kemp “a remarkable architect of voter suppression.” That’s become a rallying cry for Democrats in the governor’s race, which recent public polling shows in a statistical dead heat.\n\nKemp, meanwhile, says Abrams and allied liberal activists are twisting his record of guarding Georgia elections against voter fraud.\n\nHis campaign spokesman Ryan Mahoney said in a statement that because of Kemp, “it has never been easier to vote in our state” and pointed to a new online voter registration system and a student engagement program implemented under his tenure.\n\n“Kemp is fighting to protect the integrity of our elections and ensure that only legal citizens cast a ballot,” Mahoney said.\n\nTwo main policies overseen by Kemp have drawn criticism and legal challenges: Georgia’s “exact match” registration verification process and the mass cancellation of inactive voter registrations.\n\nAccording to records obtained from Kemp’s office through a public records request, Appling-Nunez’s application —like many of the 53,000 registrations on hold with Kemp’s office — was flagged because it ran afoul of the state’s “exact match” verification process.\n\nUnder the policy, information on voter applications must precisely match information on file with the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. Election officials can place non-matching applications on hold.\n\nAn application could be held because of an entry error or a dropped hyphen in a last name, for example.\n\nAppling-Nunez says she never saw any notice from Kemp’s office indicating a problem with her application.\n\nAn analysis of the records obtained by The Associated Press reveals racial disparity in the process. Georgia’s population is approximately 32 percent black, according to the U.S. Census, but the list of voter registrations on hold with Kemp’s office is nearly 70 percent black.\n\nKemp’s office blamed that disparity on the New Georgia Project, a voter registration group founded by Abrams in 2013.\n\nKemp accuses the organization of being sloppy in registering vo..."}

We need to pursue a clear-eyed strategy, maintaining the peace with the unambiguous capability of strength relative to China or Russia,\" he said, referring to the top two potential military threats to the U.S.\n\nAsked by lawmakers what could have stopped Russian President Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine, Milley said the only defense possible may have been to put U.S. forces inside the country, which he would not advise because it would have risked an armed conflict with Russia.\n\n\"Candidly, short of the commitment of U.S. military forces into Ukraine proper, I'm not sure he (Putin) was deterrable. This has been a long-term objective of his that goes back years,\" Milley said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin added that Russian demands, which include a ban on Ukraine entering NATO and a limit to NATO's deployments of troops and weapons on its eastern flank, were unacceptable.\n\nHe and Milley confirmed that while U.S. forces were not training Ukrainian forces inside Ukraine or in neighboring Poland, they were training them outside of Ukraine, including inside the United States.\n\nThe U.S. continues to talk to Ukraine on a \"daily basis,\" and Ukrainians have used U.S. military aid, including Stinger and Javelin missiles, effectively against Russian troops and weapons, Austin told lawmakers.\n\n\"We look for things that also can provide them an advantage in this fight, and you've seen us begin to deploy some of those things,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to training Ukrainians, the U.S. is looking at ways to provide additional military training to non-NATO allies such as Georgia and Finland, Austin said.\n\nMilley told lawmakers that NATO countries on the alliance's eastern flank, such as Poland and Romania, are \"very willing\" to establish permanent U.S. bases.\n\n\"They'll build them. They'll pay for them,\" Milley said, adding that U.S. forces could \"cycle through on a rotational basis\" to \"get the effect of a permanent presence of forces\" without asking U.S. troops to commit to two- or three-year deployments."}

Tim Walz’ policy proposals into four sections: \"Build an Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs for Families,\" \"Safeguard Our Fundamental Freedoms,\" \"Ensure Safety and Justice For All,\" and \"Keep America Safe, Secure, and Prosperous.\"\n\nBefore the new addition, Harris' campaign website had pages to buy merchandise, donate and get to know the candidate's background, but was devoid of any policy plans for weeks even after she formally accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago 17 days ago.\n\nHarris's website now includes a promise to cut taxes for middle class families by \"ensuring no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes.\" The website promises that Harris and Walz \"will ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share, so we can take action to build up the middle class while reducing the deficit,\" including by \"rolling back Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, enacting a billionaire minimum tax, quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks, and other reforms to ensure the very wealthy are playing by the same rules as the middle class.\"\n\nHARRIS TEAM MOVES TO SOFTEN POTENTIAL DEBATE IMPACT 'BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS' AND MORE TOP HEADLINES\n\nKamala Harris at a campaign rally in Savannah, Georgia, on Aug. 29, 2024.(REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz)\n\nThe website touts a plan to give more than 100 million working and middle-class families a tax cut by restoring theChild Tax Creditand the Earned Income Tax Credit. It says Harris and Walz will also expand the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 credit to families with newborn children.\n\n\"Under her plan, the tax rate on long-term capital gains for those earning a million dollars a year or more will be 28 percent, because when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger,\" the website says.\n\nThe website also claims that Harris’ \"lowering costs agenda is a stark contrast to Donald Trump’s plans to jack up prices, weaken the middle class, cut Social Security and Medicare, eliminate the Department of Education and preschool programs like Head Start, and end the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nDonald Trump departs a campaign event at the Central Wisconsin Airport on Sept. 7, 2024 in Mosinee, Wisconsin.(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMuch of the Harris website's policy section focuses on attacking her opponent.

Harris’ website also claims Trump would ban abortion and restrict in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, despite the Republican nominee stating the opposite. Trump has said he would not enact a federal abortion ban and recently said he would consider making sure the government or insurance companies cover the fertility treatment.\n\n\"Kamala Harris added a late-night, half-a--, wish list of policies to her website to solve the problems SHE helped create over the past four years,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump Campaign National Press Secretary, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"If Kamala really wanted to lower costs and secure the border – why did she cast the tie-breaking vote to cause inflation and support the war on our energy industry, and why is she allowing an invasion of illegal immigrants through our southern border as we speak?\"\n\nRegarding the economy, Harris claims that Trump’s \"plans would increase costs for families by at least $3,900 a year by slapping a Trump sales tax on imported everyday goods that American families rely on, like gas, food, clothing, and medicine\" and would raise rents and add $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.\n\nHERITAGE RIPS HARRIS' 'DANGEROUSLY LIBERAL' POLICY RECORD WITH NEW WEBSITE, 6-FIGURE OUTREACH TO INDEPENDENTS\n\n\"Trump’s economic plans would also trigger a recession by mid-2025, cost America over 3 million jobs, threaten hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs, increase the debt by over $5 trillion, send inflation skyrocketing, and hurt every..."}

Circuit, she is one of our nation’s brightest legal minds and will be an exceptional Justice.”\n\nBreyer announced his retirementlast month after 28 years on the Supreme Court, effective when the current term ends this summer. That paved the way for Biden to fulfill his 2020 campaign promise of nominating a black woman as a Supreme Court justice.\n\nBREYER RETIREMENT ALLOWS BIDEN TO NOMINATE FIRST BLACK FEMALE JUSTICE\n\n“For too long, our government, our courts haven’t looked like America, and I believe it is time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation with a nominee of extraordinary qualifications,” Biden said while opening his nationally televised introduction of Jackson.\n\nJackson, 51, was known to be on a short list of contenders the White House considered for the role and exhibits a unique background, having been a federal trial court judge for eight years without experience as a prosecutor or major corporate lawyer. Other contenders — such as South Carolina judge Michelle Childs, who was believed to have had support from that state’s two Republican senators — were thought to have more bipartisan appeal.\n\n“I am truly humbled by the extraordinary honor of this nomination, and I am especially grateful for the care that you have taken in discharging your constitutional duty in service of our democracy with all that is going on in the world today,” Jackson said at a press conference with Biden Friday afternoon.\n\nRussell Wheeler, a governance studies expert with the Brookings Institution, told theWashington ExaminerJackson’s selection was especially poignant because “finally you’re going to have two people on the court that have imposed a criminal sentence,” also referring to Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s time as a district court judge.\n\n“Now with the Supreme Court selection, you see what I suspect may be an effort on the part of the White House to placate the progressives in the judiciary as [Biden] had little interest in their demands of Supreme Court revision, whether it be a change in the number of justices or term limits,” Wheeler said.\n\nBefore she became a judge, Jackson worked as a public defender representing indigent criminal defendants and served as vice chairwoman on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. She studied government at Harvard University, graduating in 1992, and is an alumna of Harvard Law School.\n\nLast June, the Biden administration selected Jackson to succeed Attorney General Merrick Garland as a judge before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; she recently delivered her first opinion on the bench in theAFL-CIO v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,siding with federal labor unions. After her nomination, she was confirmed by a vote of 53 to 44.\n\nJackson’s name has circulated among Democratic leaders for several years. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016, then-President Barack ObamaputJackson on his short list of replacements. Obama ultimately nominated Garland, a move that then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked from proceeding until after the 2016 election. Donald Trump’s surprise White House win that year led to the nomination and Senate confirmation of conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nBiden spent months before Breyer’s retirement announcement reviewing biographies of Supreme Court candidates. He aims to confirm Jackson at a similar pace to consideration of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed 35 days after her nomination by Trump in 2020.\n\nAlex Deise, a policy manager at FreedomWorks, told theWashington Examinerhe thinks “Republicans should put on a fair and impartial hearing,” referring to the “not fair” hearings that took place for both Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett under the Trump administration.\n\nDeise added that Republicans should still intently question Jackson on whether she “embraces originalism” and gain insight into where she believes the Supreme Court derives its power from. “Just because judicial nominees on these types of questions have a long history of being evasive, I do not think that excuses a senator’s duty of advice and consent and their constitutional role with advice and consent in this process,” Deise added.\n\nThe Biden administration has tapped former Democratic Sen. Doug Jones tooverseeoperations for introducing his selection to senators and coordinating meetings to prepare her for confirmation to the highest court.\n\nSen.

A majority, 54%, of respondents disapproved of him. Another 13% did not have an opinion of the president more than a year after his inauguration.\n\nSenate Republican campaigns spokesman T.W. Arrighi quipped after the poll’s release that “it’ll all be over soon” for Democrats. In particular, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has seized on Biden’s “catastrophic” Hispanic support, attributing the erosion to his “wasteful” spending proposals and weak immigration policies.\n\n“When it rains, it pours — and Democrats are in the midst of a biblical-level hurricane,” Arrighi said. “There’s no sunlight in the distance, but November is right around the corner.”\n\nArrighi’s House Republican counterpart, Mike Berg, similarly alluded to the Democratic strategist who advised the party to brace for a “biblical disaster” this midterm cycle. Berg said the operative was “on to something.”\n\nAlthough a third of adults approved of Biden, the number of registered voters, a more accurate barometer of midterm turnout, who agreed was not much better at 35%. Both data points mark the return of January’s enthusiasm before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n“The heartbreaking images from 4,000 miles away leave Americans with a longing to do more — for those fleeing the Russian onslaught and for those staying to fight,” Quinnipiac pollster Tim Malloy said. “But the moral outrage stops at the water’s edge when it comes to committing the U.S. military to the fight.”\n\nQuinnipiac has repeatedly found Biden’s job approval to be below 40% among registered voterssince November. But even though it is the least flattering of the president, the poll is not an outlier. During the same time frame, ABC/Washington Post, Harvard University-Harris Insights & Analytics, Marist College, Monmouth University, and Suffolk University/USA Todayresearchers have yielded similar results. Marist, for example, found Biden’s approval was 39% in March, which erased his State of the Union recovery of 47% but equaled his February figure, the college’s lowest.\n\nHoping to counter the poll, Democrats moved forward with a campaign amplifying NRSC Chairman and Florida Sen. Rick Scott’s pitch to introduce a tax hike this week before Tax Day on April 18.\n\n“Republicans have made clear that if they gain power, they’ll raise taxes for half of Americans,” Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Adonna Biel said. “While Mitch McConnell tries to hide his agenda from voters, his party is blowing the door wide open on their priorities.”\n\nBiden is aware of the political reality right now, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki. That includes the Ukraine war, which she said is “dominating the airwaves,” and a pandemic-upended economy. As part of the administration’s efforts to influence public opinion, Biden will keep hosting events focused on the economy, Psaki added.\n\n“Our view is while the world needs to understand and see how he is leading on the war, the world also needs to see — or the country needs to see, I guess I should say — how he is continuing to lead on the economy,” she said.\n\nPsaki did not concede that the Quinnipiac poll necessitated a political strategy “shift.” Instead, it indicated connecting with “our domestic audience” should be “a huge priority,” she contended.\n\n“And his schedule tells the story of how much of a priority it is,” Psaki said.\n\nBiden has increased his travel this month, visiting Iowa and North Carolina this week, in addition to a planned New Hampshire trip next week, before the midterm elections.\n\nNorth Carolina has one toss-up House seat, as does Iowa,according to theCook Political Report.

Michael McCaul of Texas told theWashington Examinerthe Biden administration ignored the bleak assessments from the Pentagon and the intelligence community, and he critiqued the U.S. Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, who had negotiated the February 2020 deal in Doha, Qatar, with the Taliban and had continued to insist wrongly the extremist group was open to a peaceful settlement rather than taking the country by force.\n\n“The IC assessments got grimmer by the briefing,” McCaul told theWashington Examinerwhen speaking of the time frame following President Joe Biden’s Aprilannouncementthat all U.S. troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. “I have never heard more grim assessment on Afghanistan on these briefings, while at the same time the State Department gave this rosy picture … was giving a more rosy picture of the negotiations that special envoy Zal Khalilzad was entertaining.”\n\nMcCaul added: “And I would meet with Zal periodically about these Taliban negotiations, and I frankly didn’t put a lot of stock into them because it was the Taliban.”\n\nINTEL COMMUNITY DEFENDS ITSELF AFTER SWIFT TALIBAN TAKEOVER\n\nKhalilzad repeatedlysaidhe did not believe the Afghan government would collapse nor that the Taliban would rapidly take over, clinging to the apparent fiction that the Taliban were legitimately seeking a peaceful settlement.\n\n“The Taliban must recognize that they have a choice between two very different futures: They can embrace a negotiated path to peace, make the transition from a violent insurgency to a political movement, and join their fellow Afghans in a nation that enjoys respect in the global community,” Khalilzadtoldthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 27. “But if they obstruct a negotiated settlement and instead pursue a military takeover, they will be opposed not only by the United States but by our allies, partners, and the region.”\n\nKhalilzad added: “I don’t personally believe that there will be an imminent collapse. I know there are others who have had a different view. I believe the choice that the Afghans face is between a negotiated political settlement or a long war. … I do not believe that the government is going to collapse or the Taliban is going to take over.”\n\nAs recently as early August, Khalilzad was still insisting that a Taliban takeover would not happen,tellingVoice of America such a move would make them “a pariah state, which they say they don’t want.” He said: “The Taliban cannot conquer Afghanistan and have a government and that has the support of the overwhelming majority of the Afghans and international support. Maybe some Taliban think there is a military solution to the conflict, although they tell us otherwise. When they speak to us, the Taliban says there is no military solution.”\n\nThe U.S. envoy’slast tweetwas on Thursday, in which he promoted a statement issued by the negotiating countries in Qatar and said, “We demand an immediate end to attacks against cities, urge a political settlement, and warn that a government imposed by force will be a pariah state.” The Taliban took Kabul just a few days later.\n\nJust over a month ago, on July 7, Bidenclaimed, “The likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken was similarlydismissivewhen McCaul pressed him on June 7 about the Biden administration’s failure to prepare special immigrant visas for Afghan interpreters and allies properly.\n\n“If there is a significant deterioration in security, that could well happen — we have discussed this before — I do not think it is going to be something that happens from a Friday to a Monday,” Blinken said. “So, I would not necessarily equate the departure of forces in July, August, or by early September with some kind of immediate deterioration in the situation.”\n\nMcCaul said: “The IC came out with like a six month — that basically the Taliban was going to take over, that Afghan forces were not going to be able to adequately defend themselves without our air support and our intelligence and logistics. So that was no secret. And for the administration to say that the IC got it wrong is just not accurate — it’s not truthful.\n\n“And I think they really put all their eggs in the Doha basket, which obviously didn’t work out. And they were doing that as recently as a few days ago, talking about how, ‘Oh, we’re still holding out for these negotiations.’ And their six-month prediction was sort of based on the spring offensive and the summer and the fall, and then..."}

In a post on Twitter, Facebook’scorporate account calledthe FTC’s latest complaint “meritless,” writing, “There was no valid claim that Facebook was a monopolist — and that has not changed.”\n\n“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market”\n\nFirst filed in December 2020, the FTC alleges that Facebook’s acquisitions of competing networks gave it monopoly power over social network services in the US. But the following June, the court dismissed the complaint, finding that the commission had failed to provide sufficient evidence that Facebook had monopoly power in social networks. However, the court gave the FTC an opportunity to file an amended complaint that addressed the concerns, eventually setting the deadlinefor August 19th.\n\nTogether with the amended complaint, the FTC also made clear that chair Lina Khan will continue to play an active role in the case. In July, Facebookcalled on Khanto recuse herself from the agency’s lawsuit against the company based on her, based on her legal scholarship. “For the entirety of her professional career, Chair Khan has consistently and very publicly concluded that Facebook is guilty of violating the antitrust laws,” the company said at the time.\n\nThat effort appears to have been unsuccessful. “As the case will be prosecuted before a federal judge, the appropriate constitutional due process protections will be provided to the company,” the agency saidin a statement.\n\nIn particular, the new complaint contains a more rigorous definition of personal social networks, the market in which Facebook holds the alleged monopoly. The new complaint explicitly distinguishes Facebook from services like TikTok, which broadcast content, but do not provide an explicitly social space. The FTC’s definition also excludes services like Twitter and Reddit that share information among communities with specific interests but “do not focus on connecting friends and family.”\n\nThe complaint cites a number of internal messages to establish that Facebook understands this difference, although the specific content of the messages is redacted in the public version of the document.\n\n“Facebook... has been the dominant provider of such services since at least 2011,” the complaint concludes. “Further, Facebook Blue and Instagram are the two largest personal social networking services in the United States.” By the FTC’s definition, Facebook’s only significant competitor in the space is Snapchat, although defunct providers include Friendster, Myspace, Google+, and Path.\n\nOnce that market is defined, the complaint relies heavily on attention metrics to establish Facebook’s dominance — particularly monthly active users (MAUs), daily active users (DAUs) and time spent on-site — citing similar cases in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom that have based their claims on those metrics.\n\nOne weakness of this approach is that both Facebook and Instagram can serve multiple functions, raising the possibility that some of the metrics are in fact reflecting use of Facebook as a photo-sharing service, messaging platform, or other non-social purpose. But the FTC claims Facebook’s advantage by those metrics is so dominant as to swamp any alternative uses of the platform.\n\n“Even if one were to assume,arguendo, that half of the time that U.S. users spend on Facebook Blue and Instagram was not in fact spent using personal social networking services,” the FTC reasons, “Facebook would still have maintained a dominant share of the U.S. personal social networking market.”\n\nIn a particularly strik..."}

Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!” Iran is considered “the world’s leading sponsor of terror.”\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!The crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an “enemy of the state” and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that – this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event – maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels – so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!”"}

A deal’s been struck, but serious questions remain. Your membership powers the reporting that digs deeper and follows what happens next.\n\nAlready a member?Log in to hide these messages.\n\nPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nLawmakers on Tuesday pushed a bill through the House of Representatives to protect same-sex marriage, amid worries that it may be in dangerafter the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade abortion precedent.\n\nThe vote on the bill, authored by House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), was 267 to 157. The bill drew significant Republican support, with 47 of the 211 House GOP members voting in favor, while noDemocratsvoted against it. The bipartisan support for the legislation suggests how much political momentum the issue has gained since the 2015 Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide.\n\nThe bill’s fate in the Senate is uncertain. Republicans have derided the bill ― as they did a similar one last week intended to protect travel between states for abortions ― as Democratic fearmongering.\n\nAsked about the bill, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) saidhe would withhold commentuntil legislation was scheduled for the Senate floor. At least one member of his conference, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, has voiced support for the House bill. Senate Democrats would need the assent of at least 10 Republicans to bring it to the floor there if it were filibustered.\n\n“Congress should provide additional assurance marriage equality is a matter of settled law.”\n\nAnd with the annual August break looming, the same-sex marriage bill would compete for precious floor time with other Democratic priorities, like a drug pricing bill and a semiconductor production bill.\n\nDemocrats have been keen to show they are reacting not only to the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe, but also to possible threats to same-sex marriage and contraception, as suggested by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in Dobbs.\n\n“In a concurring opinion in Dobbs, Justice Clarence Thomas explicitly called on the court to reconsider its decisions protecting other fundamental rights, including the right to same-sex marriage,” Nadler said.\n\nWhile the majority opinion in Dobbs specifically said the ruling did not apply to other, similar precedents, Nadler said that “Congress should provide additional assurance marriage equality is a matter of settled law.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, scoffed at Nadler’s explanation.\n\n“It is for this unfounded fear that brings us here today. We are here for a charade. We’re here for political messaging,” Jordan said.“This bill is simply the latest installment of the Democrats’ campaign to delegitimize and attempt to intimidate the United States Supreme Court.”\n\nThebill would formally repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law against same-sex marriage that was overturned in Obergefell. It would require states to reciprocally recognize marriages that are legal in other states as valid, and would prohibit discrimination under state law in public acts against married couples based on their race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.\n\nLater in the week, the House is set to take up a similar bill to protect access to contraception, the legal basis of which relies on the same foundation Thomas criticized in his opinion.\n\n“Imagine telling the next generation of Americans, my generation, that we no longer have the right to marry who we love? Congress can’t allow that to happen.”\n\nIn the debate on the marriage bill, several gay Democrats spoke about their personal experiences as same-sex marriage became legal on a state-by-state basis and then nationally, and their fears of what overturning Obergefell would mean.\n\nRep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) said he was still closeted and living with friends when New York ratified same-sex marriage. When he learned it had been ratified, he said, he went into his room and closed the door so he could cry tears of joy alone.\n\nThe shutdown may be ending, but the story isn’t.

(AP Photo/Cal Woodward)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — People in their 80s lead countries, create majestic art and perform feats of endurance. One entered the record books for scaling Mount Everest. It’s soon time for Joe Biden, 80 on Sunday, to decide whether he has one more mountain to climb — the one to a second term as president.\n\nQuestions swirl now, in his own party as well as broadly in the country, about whether he’s got what it takes to go for the summit again.\n\nThe oldest president in U.S. history, Biden hits his milestone birthday at a personal crossroads as he and his family face a decision in the coming months on whether he should announce for reelection. He’d be 86 at the end of a potential second term.\n\nBiden aides and allies all say he intends to run — and his team has begun quiet preparations for a campaign — but it has often been the president himself who has sounded the most equivocal. “My intention is that I run again,” he said at a news conference this month. ”But I’m a great respecter of fate.”\n\n“We’re going to have discussions about it,” he said. Aides expect those conversations to pick up in earnest over Thanksgiving and Christmas, with a decision not until well after New Year’s.\n\nBiden planned to celebrate his birthday at a family brunch in the White House on Sunday.\n\nTo observe Biden at work is to see a leader tap a storehouse of knowledge built up over a half century in public office as he draws on deep personal relationships at home and abroad, his mastery of policy and his familiarity with how Washington works or doesn’t. In short, the wisdom of the aged.\n\n“There is something to be said for experience,” said Dartmouth College historian Matt Delmont as he noted the dozens of global leaders in their 80s.\n\nBut to observe Biden is also to see him walk now often with a halting gait, in contrast to his trotting on stage on election night 2020.\n\nIt is to see him take a pass on a formal dinner with other world leaders without a real explanation, as happened on his trip abroad this past week, when he twice spoke of visiting Colombia when he meant Cambodia. Some supporters wince when he speaks, hoping he gets through his remarks OK.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision, at age 82, to pull back from leadership and let a new generation rise may spill over into Biden’s thinking and that of his party as Democrats weigh whether they want to go with a proven winner or turn to the energy of youth.\n\nAmong the questions Pelosi’s move raises, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an authority on political communications at the University of Pennsylvania: “Even if one is highly competent and successful, is there a point at which one should step aside to give others the opportunity to lead just as others stepped aside to make it possible for you to do so?\n\n“Pelosi’s decision makes such questions more salient in the context of Biden’s 2020 statement that he was the bridge to a new..."}

We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what’s happening and why it matters.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism.Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n“He tells me that he didn’t know about it and I will take him at his word.”\n\nDuringPresident Donald Trump’s summit-ending news conferencein Vietnam on Thursday, a reporter asked him if he’d confronted North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un about the treatment of Otto Warmbier, an American student who was imprisoned in North Korea for 15 months, only to return to the US in a comatose state in June 2017 and never recover.\n\nThe reporter noted that despite Warmbier’s brutal death, Trump has called Kim “my friend” and repeatedly boasted about their “great relationship.” The journalist then asked him, “Have you in Singapore [during the first Trump-Kim summit] or here confronted Kim Jong Un about Otto Warmbier’s death, asked him to take responsibility, and what did he say to you?”\n\nTrump confirmed that he had — but went on to say he takes Kim’s word for it that he had nothing to do with it.\n\n“I really believe something very bad happened to [Warmbier], and I don’t think that the top leadership knew about it,” Trumpsaid. “I don’t believe that [Kim] would’ve allowed that to happen. It just wasn’t in his advantage to allow that to happen.”\n\nTrump continued:\n\nI did speak to [Kim about Warmbier]. He felt very badly. He knew the case very well, but he knew it later. And, you know, you got a lot of people — big country, lot of people. And in those prisons and those camps, you have a lot of people. And some really bad things happened to Otto. Some really, really bad things. But he tells me that he didn’t know about it and I will take him at his word.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that North Korea’s totalitarian dictator wasn’t aware of how a high-profile captive was treated — especially consideringthe show trialthat Warmbier, who was arrested for allegedly stealing a propaganda poster, was forced to endure.\n\nAsVox has previously detailed, the North Korean government claimed Warmbier “was left in a coma because of a food poisoning disease called botulism, but doctors were strangelyunable to identifyany trace of botulism or the cause of his deathly injuries.”\n\nAmerican doctors were also unable to discover any physical evidence of abuse or torture — despite the fact that Warmbier’s parents had described in gruesome detailthe horrific state their son was in when he’d returned to the US. “It looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and re-arranged his bottom teeth,” Warmbier’s father Fredtold GQ magazine.\n\nTrump’s comments absolving Kim of responsibility for Warmbier’s death were widely criticized. Rob Portman, a Republican US senator from Warmbier’s home state of Ohio, released a statement saying “we should never let North Korea off the hook.”\n\nTrump’s former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley also seemed to subtly rebuke the president in a tweet.\n\nBut one of the negotiators who worked to bring Warmbier home from North Korea —Mickey Bergman of the Richardson Center— told Vox he thought he understood what Trump was trying to say, albeit in an ineloquent way.\n\n“I think what [Trump] was referring to is that Kim told him he doesn’t know what went wrong,” Bergman said, adding that “whether we want to believe that or not” is another question.\n\nBergman pointed out that it’s unprecedented for a North Korean hostage to be returned to the US “in a coma.” Along the same lines, Bergman characterized the Warmbier tragedy as “an anomaly” duringan interview earlier Thursday on Fox News.\n\nBut Bergman also told Vox that “there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind and in anybody else’s mind that the North Koreans are absolutely responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier.”\n\n“Whether it was intentional or an accident,” he continued, “he was under their control or supervision, and the fact that he was in the detention for more than a year in North Korea I would argue is torture in itself.”\n\nTrump, however, wasn’t even willing to go that far.\n\nTrump’s comments about believing Kim when he says he had nothing to do with Warmbier’s death echo comments he’s made about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).\n\nThough the US intelligence community concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election on Trump’s behalf, Trump said during a joint news conference with Putin last July that Putin “was extremely strong and powerful in his denial” and hence “I don’t see any reason” to believe the US intelligence community over Putin’s word. Trump’s comments were widely criticized, andhe later said he misspoke.\n\nAnd while the US intelligence community concluded the Saudi government was responsible for the murder of dissident journalist and US resident Jamal Khashoggi last fall, Trump indicatedhe’s willing to take MBS’s word for itthat he wasn’t..."}

Every time over the last half-century the Fed has raised interest rates this much and this quickly, it has caused a recession.\"\n\n\"A recession will be especially harmful to people who are most vulnerable to downturns in the economy--who are the first to be fired (and last to be hired again when the economy turns upward): lower-wage workers, disproportionately women and people of color,\" he added. \"The Fed is making a big mistake.\"\n\nBaker, for his part, noted that Powell is the \"first chair in recent decades to explicitly recognize the full employment side of the Fed's dual mandate and note the huge benefits of lowunemploymentto Black and Hispanic workers, people with criminal records, and other groups disadvantaged in the labor market.\"\n\n\"In keeping with this recognition,\" Baker said, \"the Fed would be well-advised to resist the frenzy of inflation fighters who want to see a whole series of large rate hikes.\"\n\nRampant inflation, a problem that ishardly uniqueto the U.S., has become a significant economic and political issue for the Biden administration, particularly as the pivotalmidterm electionsapproach.\n\nIn anop-edfor theWall StreetJournallate last month, Biden declined to criticize the Fed's approach to combating inflation, writing tha..."}

Every murder is tragic but the killing of a journalist is particularly troublesome,” Lombardo said.\n\nThose who knew and worked with German described him as an ideal example of an investigative reporter.\n\n“Jeff is the ultimate Vegas reporter. He’s been here 30 years, he’s covered everything from the mob to the fire at the MGM Grand, to the – we covered the October 1 shooting (at a music festival in 2017) together,” said Arthur Kane, a reporter at the Review-Journal. “He basically was a 100% hard-hitting reporter, and this was the kind of work he was going to do for as long as he could.”\n\nRelated articleA Las Vegas public official has been arrested in connection with the killing of an investigative journalist, his newspaper says\n\n“The Review-Journal family is devastated to lose Jeff,”Review-Journal executive editor Glenn Cook said. “He was the gold standard of the news business.

It tells a tale of a dominantDonald Trumpeasily dispatching a field that sought to keep him from a path back to the White House. There were some surprises, thought; former South Carolina Governor and Ambassador to the U.N.Nikki Haleyexceeded expectations, while entrepreneurVivek Ramaswamyshattered them–for a while anyway. And then there was Florida GovernorRon DeSantis, who so many expected to pose a devastating challenge to Donald Trump—only to see him tank in the polls.\n\nWhy didn't DeSantis catch on? What did he do wrong? The answer is: virtually nothing.\n\nIn the horse-race-obsessed style of modern campaign coverage, conclusions are binary—winners are winners and losers are losers. While that will always be technically true, any head-scratching over the DeSantis performance misses key points.\n\nFirst, there was no way DeSantis was going to spring out of the gates to approach Trump's numbers when he announced in late May. While the prospect of his campaign had long been touted as the most plausible threat to Trump's domination, an instant bounce would have required two elements: GOP voters swooning over the Florida Governor and legions of Trump voters deciding to bail.\n\nDeSantis earned some early support from various conservative corners and retains devotion from hopeful backers to this day. But the other end of the math problem never materialized. Trump supporters didn't just maintain their steadfastness—they ramped it up, joined by ambivalent poll respondents who wanted to make a statement against what they see as a politically motivated barrage of criminal charges.\n\nAgainst that wave of sentiment, catching Trump in the polls has gone from difficult to impossible for any rival. DeSantis admitted as much in an interview last week. \"If I could have one thing change, I wish Trump hadn't been indicted on any of this stuff,\" DeSantis told David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, adding that the cascade of indictments \"just crowded out so much other stuff.... It's sucked out all the oxygen.\"\n\nPrecisely.\n\nThis is the sound of DeSantis realizing that he was never going to catch Trump in the 2023 polls. His supporters should realize the same, and so should anyone who comments on such things for a living.\n\nDeSantis has done well in debates, in his ads, in public events, and in TV appearances. It is the shallowest of analysis to go looking for nitpicky things he must have done wrong—he focused too much on this, too little on that, he seems awkward at times, his boots have high heels.\n\nAll ridiculous. Ron DeSantis is a deeply gifted conservative with executive experience that would make him a superb president. Even Trump voters know it. His supporters just want their guy.\n\nThe dumbest shade thrown at DeSantis is that he hasn't attacked Trump enough. AskChris Christiehow well that approach is working. DeSantis has taken the occasional potshot, jabbing at Trump for skipping debates, obsessing over 2020, failing to completely build the literal wall or drain the metaphoric swamp.\n\nThose are not the smartest talking points when you are trying to lure voters who harbor such gratitude for Trump's service that they seek his return. The wiser DeSantis narrative would have always been, \"Like you, I loved his presidency. But if you want those policies back, I am your best bet. I have a better chance of beating Biden, and I can serve two terms.\"\n\nNot that this would have magically vaulted him the forty poll points necessary to catch Trump, but it would have landed better in what is still Trump's Republican Party.\n\nAs the calendar page turns to January and its tantalizing dates with destiny in Iowa and New Hampshire, the only hope for DeSantis is for large blocs of conservative voters to grudgingly conclude that their dream of Trump's hand on the Bible on January 20, 2025 is a bridge too far in view of the land mines that lie in his path.\n\nThat is not an implausible conclusion, and many January voters may reach it. Trump is not likely to vanquish DeSantis (or anyone else) by the nearly 4-to-1 margins seen in some polls. But a Trump victory by any margin would turn polls into reality, making him even harder to topple in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina on the way to Super Tuesday March 5.\n\nIf Trump has the nomination locked up by that busy day of primaries, look for post-mortems with further barbs about DeSantis's failures. They will be largely ill-placed. His problem will not have been a campaign badly run, it will be a campaign unfortunately timed at a moment when Trump-loving GOP voters respectfully passed on alternatives because the object of their admiration was still available for service.\n\nMark Davis is a talk show host for the S..."}

There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY.’ We want our Capital BACK,” Trump wrote in a post Sunday on Truth Social ahead of a planned White House press conference Monday morning about the city’s cleanliness and general condition.\n\nThe possible order follows Trump’s “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful” executive order signed on March 28, which established a task force dedicated to fighting crime and reducing illegal immigration in the city.\n\n“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY.

A deal’s been struck, but serious questions remain. Your membership powers the reporting that digs deeper and follows what happens next.\n\nAlready a member?Log in to hide these messages.\n\nLONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Prime MinisterTheresa Maybattled on Thursday to save a draft divorce deal with the European Union after her Brexit secretary and otherministers quit in protestat an agreement they say will trap Britain in the bloc’s orbit for years.\n\nJust over 12 hours after May announced that her team of top ministers had agreed to the terms of the draft agreement, Brexit minister Dominic Raab and work and pensions minister Esther McVey quit, saying they could not support it.\n\nTheir departure, and the resignations of two junior ministers, shakes May’s divided government. Raab is the second Brexit secretary to quit over May’s plans to leave the EU, the biggest shift in British policy in more than 40 years.\n\nBy leaving now, some suggested that Raab could be positioning himself as a possible successor to May.\n\nBut the prime minister showed little sign of backing down in parliament, where she warned lawmakers they now faced a stark decision - choose to leave with no deal, risk Brexit never happening or back her deal.\n\n“The choice is clear. We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated,” she said.\n\nShe acknowledged that hammering out an agreement with her cabinet was not “a comfortable process.”\n\nBut she told those lawmakers who believed she could get a deal that did not include a backstop arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland that they were wrong.\n\nIt was the backstop arrangement, which would see Britain and the EU establishing a single customs territory, that spurred her Brexit secretary and work and pensions minister to resign.\n\n“Above all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election,” Raab said.\n\n“This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust,” Raab said. “I cannot support the proposed deal.”\n\nLess than five months until Britain leaves the EU on March 29, the resignations put May’s Brexit strategy in doubt.\n\nEU leaders are ready to meet on Nov. 25 to sign off on the divorce deal, or Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe summed up the uncertainty, saying events in London raised concerns about whether the agreement would be ratified. “We need to prepare ourselves for a no-deal Brexit,” he said.\n\nSome lawmakers in London openly questioned whether May’s government will survive.\n\nOne eurosceptic lawmaker in May’s Conservative Party said more colleagues were either putting in letters to trigger a no confidence vote in her leadership or were increasingly minded to do so. A challenge is triggered if 48 Conservatives write such letters. May could be toppled if 158 of her 315 lawmakers vote against her.\n\nBritain’s opposition Labour Party said the government was “falling apart.”\n\n“Theresa May has no authority left and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her cabinet, let alone parliament and the people of our country,” said Jon Trickett, a member of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s senior team.\n\nRaab, 44, was appointed to the role of Brexit secretary in July this year following the resignation of his predecessor David Davis, who also quit in protest at May’s Brexit strategy.\n\nAt the heart of Raab’s criticism of May’s deal was the belief that the pursuit of a customs union with the EU would be the “starting point” for talks on the future relationship with the bloc, “severely prejudicing” what Britain could achieve.\n\nHe said May’s plan threatened the integrity of Britain and he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement - to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland - where the EU had a veto over Britain’s ability to exit.\n\nThe backstop arrangement to come into force if a future trade deal does not prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland has long been the main obstacle not only to a deal with the bloc, but to any agreement of her top ministers.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up May in parliament, had threatened to pull its support from the minority government if the backstop meant the province was treated differently from the rest of mainland Britain.\n\n“No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,” Raab said in his resignation letter.\n\nEurosceptics in May’s party have long feared that the prime minister was leading Britain towards a customs union with the EU, something that, they say, would mea..."}

Monkeypox “will become established in the pediatric and general population and will transmit through daycares and schools,” aprominent doctor on Twitterdeclares.\n\nIs it risky, Lisa wonders, to shop at the grocery store? Can she keep her child, born during the first year of the COVID pandemic, safe? Will she have to go back to living like she did in 2020?\n\n“I had finally gotten to the point with COVID where I was starting to relax,” she said (Lisa requested to go by her first name only). “But when I heard about monkeypox, it was like a huge pit in my stomach. I open Twitter and see people telling me you need afull PPE suitto go outside. I can’t take living in fear for another two years, and I want to let my child live a normal life.” She’s trying to be rational about the newly-spreading virus, but it’s difficult. “I worry about monkeypox, then I don’t, then I do again, because the messaging has been pretty inconsistent,” she explains.\n\nThe message that anyone can get monkeypox, widely disseminated by public health officials and the media, is not incorrect, but it is misleading. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists direct contact with monkeypox sores, respiratory secretions during face-to-face contact, sex, cuddling, and touching contaminated items as potential transmission routes—but they’re not all equally risky. The raging social media debate about whether monkeypox can be considered a sexually transmitted infection misses the point: Right now, it is primarily spreading during sex and, like most STIs, it can be transmitted other ways as well.\n\nWhile anyone could potentially catch the virus through close physical contact, the “vast majority” of people getting it now are gay and bisexual men, according to CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. In arecent studyof more than 500 cases in 16 countries, 98 percent were among men who have sex with men, and sexual contact was identified as the likely transmission route in 95 percent of cases.\n\nSo far, there have been a relatively small number of cases outside of this group: health officials have reported around 100 monkeypox cases among women worldwide—about 1 percent of the global total. Last week the CDC announced thefirst two cases in childrenin the United States, both attributed to household contact. Aslow start to testing effortsleft some experts worried that monkeypox could be spreading undetected among women and kids. But as testing capacity has expanded and more women have gotten tested, few are turning up positive—just eight out of 2,891 cases in the United States, according to the CDC’s latest tally.\n\nThe mixed messaging has left the public understandably confused. Women havegone viralon social media describing their frustration at being unable to get tested when they developed telltale sores, but many more common conditions, including herpes, staph infection, and acne can look like monkeypox. (Slate attempted to speak with women who tested positive but was unable to find any.)\n\n“The last thing I wanted to see was another disease outbreak just as things were starting to feel a bit more normal,” says Zie Gosset, 25, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, who has been watching all of this play out on her phone screen. “When monkeypox came around in mid-May, it brought up a lot of unresolved trauma and anxiety from the early months of 2020. Would I be at risk? Would I end up at home for nearly a month with a painful rash?” It didn’t help her anxiety to see social media pundits with hundreds of thousands of followers “state with certainly that monkeypox was going to rip through schools and businesses and rapidly infect everyone.”\n\nCOVID taught us the perils of making predictions about a new epidemic, but many experts do not foresee an explosion of cases outside gay men’s sexual networks. TheEuropean Center for Disease Prevention and Control, for example, considers the likelihood of monkeypox spreading further among networks of people with multiple sex partners to be high, but the chances of it spreading among the broader population to be “very low.”\n\n“We are likely to see more limited types of spread in other groups in newly affected countries with occasional cases in household contacts of infected persons or even transmission from animals,” Dr. Boghuma K. Titanji, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, told Slate. “But it’s hard to imagine that this will take off in other groups leading to large-scale outbreaks like what we are seeing in men who have sex with men.”\n\nThis is consistent with our understanding of monkeypox prior to the current outbreak. Historically, the disease has not been considered easy to transmit from person to person. Extensive outbreaks have never been reported in Central and West Africa, where the virus is endemic.

The full approval was based on study results involving more than 44,000 people followed for six months.\n\nThe license applies only to those 16 and over, but the vaccine is allowed for those 12 to 15 under the previous authorization.\n\n“Based on the longer-term follow-up data that we submitted, today’s approval for those aged 16 and over affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed,” Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.  “I am hopeful this approval will help increase confidence in our vaccine, as vaccination remains the best tool we have to help protect lives and achieve herd immunity.\"\n\nActing FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said she hoped the approval would help alter the course of the pandemic in the USA.\n\n“The public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,” Woodcock said in a statement. “While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated.”\n\nThe full process involves more data and more time in part because once a drug or vaccine is approved by the FDA, doctors are able to prescribe it \"according to the practice of medicine,\" also known as off-label.\n\nMarks said last month that full approval would allow for a \"broader potential use\" of the vaccine, \"not that we're recommending off-label uses.\"\n\n\"When we give a biologics license, we are really saying that we have a lot of confidence in that product, in the safety, efficacy, manufacturing information, not just when it's used exactly according to how it's labeled, but potentially if it were used somewhat differently by physicians,\" he said.\n\nWoodcock said Monday at a news conference that she hoped doctors would not prescribe the vaccine to children under age 12 for whom the vaccine has not yet been approved. The appropriate dose for younger children has not been determined, she said.\n\nThis ability to prescribe off-label means doctors could authorize people to get an extra Pfizer-BioNTech shot, even before booster shots are made available to the general public – likely to be the week of Sept. 20.\n\n\"It might discourage people from waiting eight months\" to get a booster shot, as the administration recommends, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease specialist at the Georgetown University School of Medicine.\n\nIt might make it harder for people who are immunocompromised, who are allowed to get boosters..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Alex Jones Infowars Permanently Banned Twitter", "output": "Twitter on Thursday permanently banned accounts belonging to Alex Jones and Infowars over a video of the radio host confronting a CNN reporter for lobbying to blacklist him from the social media platform, which CEO Jack Dorsey described as a “digital town hall” before Congress the day before.\n\nIn a statement shared on Twitter, the company said it terminated Jones’ accounts for “abusive behavior”:\n\nToday, we permanently suspended @realalexjones and @infowars from Twitter and Periscope. We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accounts’ past violations. As we continue to increase transparency around our rules and enforcement actions, we wanted to be open about this action given the broad interest in this case. We do not typically comment on enforcement actions we take against individual accounts, for their privacy. We will continue to evaluate reports we receive regarding other accounts potentially associated with @realalexjones or @infowars and will take action if content that violates our rules is reported or if other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent their ban.\n\nAhead of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesday, Jones confronted CNN’s Oliver Darcy outside the hearing room, accusing the reporter of leading a campaign to purge Infowars from the Internet.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne_wFdA-1oU\n\nA Twitter spokesperson told the Daily Beast that Jones’ exchange with Darcy — in which he referred to the activist reporter as a “rat,” “possum,” “evil-looking,” and a “virus” — violated the platform’s Terms of Services. Jones mocked Darcy during the confrontation, predicting the CNN reporter would “go to Twitter and say, ‘He’s bullying me! I’m only trying to deplatform [inaudible] and celebrating it, and then insulting my viewers a week later, saying no one’s doing it!'”\n\nThe company warned it will “take action” against Infowars if Jones attempts to bypass the permanent suspension.\n\nIn addition, Twitter has placed Infowars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson under a 12-hour suspension. A screenshot obtained by Breitbart News shows Watson’s account was temporarily limited after sharing a video of the exchange between Jones and Darcy, with minimal commentary: “Here’s the video of Alex Jones confronting CNN’s @oliverdarcy – the reporter who lobbied YouTube & Facebook to shut down Infowars. ‘You are incredibly shameful,’ Jones told Darcy, adding, ‘You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.'”\n\nIn response, Watson told Breitbart News, “The fact that Alex Jones has been banned for ‘targeted harassment’ for a video in which he had a forthright but ultimately peaceful exchange of views with a CNN reporter is ludicrous.”\n\n“This is clearly corporate media working in cahoots with Big Tech to silence its competition once again,” he added.\n\nDarcy has repeatedly dismissed concerns of big tech platforms suppressing conservatives and Republicans during an election year, recently criticizing President Donald Trump bringing attention to the issue in a series of tweets last week. “President Donald Trump on Friday morning claimed in a tweet that social media companies are ‘silencing millions of people,’ exacerbating a longstanding paranoia from conservatives who have for years erroneously accused social media companies of bias and censorship,” hewrotelast Friday.\n\nThe articlecitedthe president’s tweet calling on Silicon Valley to stop censoring social media users in its so-called fight against fake news. “Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can’t do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!” Trump tweeted last Friday.\n\nDarcy alsoaccusedconservatives of falsely claiming they are being “unfairly treated” by Silicon Valley giants to exploit what he describes as a “flimsy narrative.” Further, The CNN reporter claims previous disciplinary actions against Jones were due to “hate speech” and “harassment” — not political ideology. “The tech platforms said they removed Jones’ content for violations of their hate speech and harassment guidelines. They have maintained that they do not discriminate against users for their political beliefs,” he wrote.\n\nOn August 14, Twitter slapped Jones with aseven-day suspension, which prevented him from tweeting or retweeting content. In a video shared on Infowars’ Twitter account, Jones said Twitter suspended him over a video he shared in which he implored the president to investigate the social media censorship of conservatives.\n\nEarlier in the month,Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify removed large amounts of content produced Jones and Infowars.\n\nApple removed the Alex Jones Show, along with five additional Infowars programs, from iTunes, citing “hate speech.” “Apple d..."}

John Warner, who represented Virginia in the US Senate for three decades and was widely respected for his views on military affairs, has died. He was 94.\n\nWarner died peacefully on Tuesday evening of heart failure, surrounded by his wife Jeanne Warner and other family members, a former staff member said.\n\nFuneral arrangements have not yet been announced.\n\nWarner, a Navy veteran of World War II and a Marine during the Korean War, served as a Republican US senator from 1979 through 2009,becoming the second-longest serving senator in Virginia’s history. By the time of his retirement, he was seen as a principled Republican who, although he frequently supported the multiple GOP presidents whose terms overlapped with his tenure in the Senate, wasn’t afraid to buck his party in several controversial instances and who garnered wide respect across the political spectrum.\n\n“Virginia, and America, have lost a giant,” Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, said in a statement Wednesday in which he also said the Virginia state flag will be flown at half-staff over the Virginia Capitol on the day of his funeral. Flags on the Senate side of the US Capitol will be lowered to half-staff, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office said.\n\n“I had the privilege of serving alongside John in the Senate for three decades,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Wednesday. “The John Warner I knew was guided by two things: his conscience and our Constitution. And, when acting in accordance with both, he neither wavered in his convictions nor was concerned with the consequences.”\n\nWarner’s military experience led him to be one of the most respected voices in Washington on military and national security issues, and he served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee during the early years of the Iraq War.\n\nWarner initially supported the US-led invasion, voting in favor of the of the 2002 joint resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq. But Warner drew increasingly critical of the war. In 2006, after an overseas trip to Baghdad, Warnersaidthe situation was “drifting sideways” and called for a “change in course.”\n\nHe opposed then-President George W. Bush’s decision to increase troop levels in Iraq in 2007, introducing a bipartisan resolution to put the Senate on the record against the President’s plan, and latercalled on Bush to start withdrawing some troops.\n\nIt wasn’t the only time he bucked his party. He chosenot to supportRobert Bork’s 1987 nomination to the Supreme Court andopposedOliver North’s 1994 candidacy for US Senate.\n\nIn an interview in 2017, Warner told CNN’s Dana Bash that he wanted his legacy to be “just that I was honest, independent in my thinking.”\n\nWarner was born on February 18, 1927, in Washington, DC. He was 17 when he enlisted in the US Navy during World War II, and later served as a US Marine in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his law degree and served as a clerk in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit before becoming an assistant US attorney in the late 1950s and then going into private practice.\n\nHe worked in the Department of the Navy for five years during the Vietnam War, during which he was secretary of the Navy from 1972 to 1974. When he served as chairman of the nation’s bicentennial celebration in 1976, he met his future wife and Hollywood icon Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n“I was invited to escort her, at the request of Her Majesty’s staff, to the small dinner party given at the British Embassy,” Warner recalled during an interview on CNN’s “Newsroom” in 2011. “I say small, but President Ford was there, Vice President Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger. It was quite a party. And we met. And then a week or so later, she said she’d like to come down to see my farms and ride a horse, and that was the beginning.”\n\nTaylor would campaign alongside Warner during his first Senate run in 1978, which he won narrowly, no doubt helped in part by his fame as Taylor’s husband. She was anactive figure for her husband on the campaign trail, attracting huge crowds at events.\n\nBut after Warner became a senator, the twoseparatedin 1981 and divorced the following year. Warner and Taylor, however,remained friendsuntil Taylor’s death in 2011.\n\nWarner later won election to a second term by 70% of the vote against Democratic challenger Edythe Harrison. He would serve five termsbefore deciding to retire in 2009, citing his age and the demands of his job.\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner (no relation), who gave John Warner a tough reelection battle in 1996 and now holds his old Senate seat, on Wednesday called his former political foe a “consummate statesman and a public servant who always put Virginia before politics; who put the nation’s security before partisanship; who put the country’s needs above his own.”\n\n“Even though we came from different political parties – even though we ran spirited, albeit respectful, campaigns that year – as soon as the election was called, it ..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Verizon Drops Oan Tv Product", "output": "Once upon a time there was a cable news network that nobody liked. Nobody except the loons, that is: those very special people who willfully eschew logical reasoning and the established corpus of knowledge in favor of febrile theories, weird cultural grievances, and other made-up bullshit. As luck would have it, there were enough loons out there for the network to be aired by many cable providers, and to reap millions of dollars in carriage fees year after year after year. Then, in a shocking development, one of America’s foremost loons was elected president—and One America News Network, the network that nobody liked, found itself having A Moment.\n\nIt is now July 2022, and OAN’s moment is definitively over. On Sunday, July 31, the network’s carriage deal with Verizon Fiosexpires and will not be renewed, meaning that OAN will no longer be included in any of Verizon’s cable packages. The Verizon deal is the second major carriage deal that OAN has lost this year; itslucrative distribution agreement with DirecTVexpired and was not renewed in April. As of August 1, the network will only be viewable via certain streaming services, its own app, and on certain smaller cable providers such as GCI, which operates in Alaska. Yukon ho, conspiracists!\n\nSome OAN network personnel havecharacterized this trendas “cancel culture” motivated by a “Marxist agenda,” rhetoric which in itself sort of shows you why very few companies want to be in business with the network anymore. Accusations of censorship aside, the deplatforming of OAN can also be seen as a simple business decision on the part of Verizon and DirecTV: Namely, that it no longer makes sense for these carriers to spend good money each year airing a network that nobody watches, is beset by lawsuits, and is a vector for toxic misinformation. Before we bid farewell to OAN, though, let’s look back at its “glory days,” such as they are.\n\nOAN was founded in 2013 by Robert Herring, a high-school dropout and serial entrepreneur who apparently saw a market for a cable news network that wasted neither time nor money on standard production values or credible fact-checking. The market opportunity was driven by the way that the business of cable and satellite television works. These carriers long attracted customers by touting subscription packages featuring hundreds of channels, many of which go broadly unwatched. (Have you watched “So Yummy TV” lately? How about “World Harvest Television”?) These tiny networks are sustained, by and large, by carriage fees: micropayments that are assessed on a per-subscriber basis and paid out by the cable/satellite provider to their constituent networks. The providers generally roll these fees into the subscription prices that they charge their users, which means, basically, that it doesn’t cost DirecTV much of anything at all to create a channel slot for, like, The Mistletoe Network or Broom Closet TV.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered why cable and satellite packages are so expensive, it’s because you’re paying for the hundreds of stupid little channels that youdon’twatch in order to access the dozen or so that you do. Cord-cutting and the rise of streaming services have, of late, imperiled this business model, which is one big reason why many major cable and satellite providers are seeking to divest themselves of channels that no longer add value.  Back in 2013, though, if you had had sufficient resources, sales acumen, and ambition, you, too, could have launched a bare-bones cable network and realized profit via carriage fees.\n\nOAN probably would have remained broadly unnoticed on the back end of the channel list, shouting weird theories and paleoconservative dogma to insomniacs and shut-ins and reaping the carriage fee boondoggle. But then came the rise of Donald Trump. OAN’s moment in the sun began with Trump’s election, because Trump effectivelywasthe network’s core demographic: an aging, inattentive crank receptive to conspiracies and addled by resentments. While Fox News’ eventual embrace of the Trump candidacy seemed perhaps a bit opportunistic, OAN and Trump were in each other’s wheelhouse rightfrom the start. “It’s a great network,” Trump said of OANin August 2017, after taking a press conference question from the network’s 23-year-old White House correspondent. The network was still obscure and unpopular, but now it had a well-placed champion.\n\nOAN’s moment arguably peaked in November and December 2020, as right-wing viewers seeking validation of their objectively incorrect belief that Donald Trump actually won that year’s presidential election fled Fox News for OAN and Newsmax, another right-wing news channel. Those two networks were willing to entertain the premise that the election had been stolen (it had not been stolen), and as a result they saw a short-term bump in their ratings numbers and their public profiles. Then, on Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of loons agitated by these stolen-election lies marched on and over-ran the U.S. Capitol..."}

June’s reading was revised higher by 88,000 jobs to 938,000.\n\n\"Although there have been some cracks in the armor, today’s jobs number showed that once again our economy is incredibly resilient and moving forward,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nBONDS AND STOCKS AT A CROSSROAD\n\nNotable job gains were seen in leisure and hospitality (+380,000), which saw two-thirds of the jobs gained in food services and drinking places. Public and private education (+261,000), professional and business services (+60,000), transportation and warehousing (+50,000) also saw sizable gains. Construction and wholesale trade were little changed.\n\nThe jobs gains occurred as three additional states ended the supplemental $300 per week in unemployment benefits. A fourth state, Maryland, was scheduled to end the benefits but was blocked from doing so by a Baltimore judge.\n\nThe labor force participation rate was little changed at 61.7%. The rate has held between 61.4% and 61.7% since June 2020.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.4% month over month and 4% annually. Economists had expected respective increases of 0.3% and 3.8%.\n\nThe U.S. economy has gained 16.7 million jobs since April 2020 but is down by 5.7 million from pre-pandemic levels.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAs the economy continues to recover from its COVID-19-induced slowdown, economists have begun to question the need for the emergency measures put in place during the early days of the pandemic. The Fed slashed interest rates to near zero and has been buying U.S. Treasurys and other assets at a pace of $120 billion per month.\n\nThe central bank said at its most recent meeting that it would need to see \"substantial further progress\" before beginning the tapering process.\n\nRecent comments from Federal Reserve Board members Richard Clarida and Christoper Waller indicated a run of strong jobs reports would be evidence of such progress.\n\nFed tapering is \"squarely on the table for 2022,\" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,\" says Chris.\n\n\"When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock.\n\n\"As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans.\n\n\"9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go.\n\n\"I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done.\"\n\nChris adds: \"I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy.\"\n\nNew York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is “infuriating”\nthat the Taliban are “back in control” of Afghanistan two decades after the\nSeptember 11 attacks.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US\nArmy in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he “couldn’t get on active\nduty fast enough” following the attacks.\n\n“I vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,\nthe yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home – a sense of patriotism and unity I had never\nexperienced at any other point in my life,” he said.\n\nZeldin said he believed the US withdrawal\nfrom Afghanistan would create a “path towards leaving our nation more\ndomestically vulnerable to threats”.\n\n“Creating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely\nallowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications\nbeyond Afghanistan’s borders,” he said.\n\nNine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned.\n\nRegional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, \"the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled\".\n\nThe findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September.\n\nAn international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m.\n\nFood prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought.\n\nAfghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments.\n\nPakistan has been delivering aid\n\nA former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the \"stunning\" retreat of US forces \"pulled the plumbing\" out of Afghan security forces.\n\nKarl Eikenberry described the situation as \"a house of cards militarily and politically\", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control.\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nKarl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a \"house of cards\"\n\nWomen playing cricket in Herat in 2015\n\nAfghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport.\n\nTaliban officials h..."}

Our country can't take this abuse anymore!\"\n\nIn a second statement on the two-year ban, Mr Trump attacked Facebook's founder.\n\n\"Next time I'm in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife,\" the former president said. \"It will be all business!\"\n\nThe move by Facebook allows Mr Trump to return to the platform before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIt also comes as he prepares to again hold the large scale in-person rallies that were a signature of his campaigns and presidency. One of his first is planned for Dallas, Texas, in early July, according to local media.\n\nEarlier this week, it emerged that the communications platform set up by Mr Trump in the wake of his social media bans - From the Desk of Donald J Trump - has been permanently shut down.\n\nIn addition to Facebook, which has over two billion monthly users, Mr Trump has also been banned from Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, Twitch and other social media platforms over the January riot.\n\nLast month, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican Trump ally,signed the first law in the US that punishes tech companies for de-platforming politicians.\n\nFacebook's dilemma on Trump was complex, involved trade-offs, and was guaranteed to upset millions of people. The fact is - whatever their decision - it was bound to be polarising.\n\nBut just to be clear: today Facebook, the world's biggest social network, has denied access to its megaphone to a man who 74 million people voted for. They didn't just know him, or approve of him; they voted for him to be US president. That is a big call.\n\nFacebook says public figures who violate its rules by inciting unrest or violence will be suspended for a month or, in more serious cases, up to two years.\n\nIt comes as part of an effort to undo a previous policy of allowing newsworthy political speech despite a potential that it may cause harm.\n\nPosts that are deemed worthy of an exception, despite possible violations, may still be allowed but will be given a warning label by Facebook. The company says it will no longer treat \"content posted by politicians any differently\".\n\n\"Instead, we will simply apply our newsworthiness balancing test in the same way to all content, measuring whether the public interest value of the content outweighs the potential risk of harm by leaving it up.\"\n\nThe company's Oversight Board found that Mr Trump's initial ban was appropriate, but that there was no rationale for the ban to remain indefinitely.\n\nThe independent board, which is funded by Facebook, has 20 members who are able to make binding decisions on content. Among the members are legal scholars, journalists, freedom of speech experts and a former prime minister of Denmark.\n\nThe announcement comes on the same day that regulators in Europe and the UK begin formal anti-trust inquiries into whether Facebook misused customer data.\n\nIn emails released by Democrats, Epstein says Trump \"knew about the girls\". The White House says they are an attempt to \"smear\" the president.\n\nReform highlighted the party's leader and head of political strategy, both who worked for the BBC.\n\nThe US president is increasingly focusing on affordability amid growing public pessimism on the economy.\n\nTrump said it was a \"total disgrace\" that S..."}

He's scheduled to appear at a rally Friday afternoon in downtown Detroit with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nThe plants struck by the union produce popular midsize trucks, off-roading SUVs and commercial vans. Workers in the final assembly and paint shop only walked out at Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant. It makes the Ranger midsize pickup and the Bronco off-roading SUV and employs about 4,600 hourly workers, according to Ford's website. Local 900 in Region 1A represents those members.\n\nOutside the Toledo Assembly Complex, local political leaders and fellow autoworkers clapped and cheered, yelling \"Here we go!\" as the first UAW members walked and drove out of the plant along I-75 shortly after midnight.\n\nIt was bittersweet taking those steps, said Joyce Jones, 51, of Toledo, a 10-year UAW member who works in quality inspection.\n\n\"It was sad, but it'll be worth it,\" she said while holding a strike sign in front of a gate off Stickney Avenue. \"It's shameful the CEOs are not willing to give their workers what we deserve. We have TPTs (temporary part-time or supplemental workers) who have been part-time for five or six years. They need to be rolled over.\"\n\nJacquel McNeal, 30, of Toledo is one such supplemental worker. January would mark three years for her. She is paid $17.53 an hour, and as a single mother, supports four children ages ranging 7 to 13.\n\n\"I do what I can,\" McNeal said. \"It's all on my way. (The recent increase in consumer items) has been a lot.\"\n\nAs vehicles honked while passing the picketers and even blasted music, autoworkers hooted and jumped up and down.\n\nThe energy was exciting, McNeal said, adding: \"I want better.\"\n\nGM and Stellantis expressed disappointment in the UAW's decision to launch the strikes in statements early Friday.\n\n“The UAW has informed GM that they are on strike at Wentzville Assembly in Missouri as of 11:59 PM,\" spokesperson David Barnas said. \"We are disappointed by the UAW leadership's actions, despite the unprecedented economic package GM put on the table, including historic wage increases and manufacturing commitments. We will continue to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible for the benefit of our team members, customers, suppliers and communities across the U.S. In the meantime, our priority is the safety of our workforce.”\n\n\"We are extremely disappointed by the UAW leadership's refusal to engage in a responsible manner to reach a fair agreement in the best interest of our employees, their families and our customers,\" Stellantis spokesperson Jodi Tinson said. \"We immediately put the Company in contingency mode and will take all the appropriate structural decisions to protect our North American operations and the Company.\"\n\nIn a statement from Ford spokesperson Jessica Enoch just after 10 p.m. Thursday, the company confirmed it had received \"its first substantive counterproposal\" from the UAW around 8 p.m. The company said the counter offer \"showed little movement from the union's initial demands submitted Aug. 3.\"\n\n\"If implemented, the proposal would more than double Ford’s current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor,\" the statement said. \"Ford has bargained in good faith in an effort to avoid a strike, which could have wide-ranging consequences for our business and the economy.\"\n\nSandy Baruah, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber, expressed concern about the impact of the union's action in a statement early Friday: \"The strike by the UAW not only impacts Michigan’s signature industry, it disproportionately impacts Michigan residents, especially those in the middle class. Every OEM auto job impacts between seven to 10 other jobs, which are all at risk as the strike shuts down the industry.\"\n\nMichigan political leaders also weighed in, with Democratic lawmakers expressing support for the UAW's action in pursuit of its bargaining goals.

This thing could really drag on for a long time.\"\n\nSome analysts agree that any patchy control over Ukraine by Russia could lead to some kind of partitioning of the country, particularly as Russia becomes firmly entrenched in eastern Ukraine — particularly in the Donbas region where it recognized the independence of two pro-Russian republics ahead of its invasion of the wider country.\n\nTaras Kuzio, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society,wrote in an article for the Atlantic Council on Thursdaythat Moscow has indicated that it is aiming at \"the complete military conquest of Ukraine followed by a partition and a massive purge of the civilian population.\"\n\n\"Putin's apparent objective is to eradicate all vestiges of Ukrainian identity while condemning the country to a grim future as a military dictatorship locked firmly inside a new Russian Empire. This nightmarish vision tallies closely with Putin's own stated objectives for the current military campaign along with his long record of public contempt and animosity towards Ukrainian statehood,\" he said.\n\nThere are many questions over who could lead a loyalist regime in Ukraine, one that could resemble that of Belarus' Alexander Lukashenko. Kuzio noted that there has been speculation about Moscow seeking to install former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was stripped of his powers by Ukrainian lawmakers during the 2014 Maidan Revolution and fled Kyiv for Russia.\n\n\"This would be entirely in keeping with Kremlin propaganda, which has insisted for the past eight years that Yanukovych was illegally removed by a Western-backed coup,\" Kuzio noted.\n\nMost warn that Ukrainians would continue to fight against any puppet regime, with the conflict descending into an insurgency with those Ukrainians left in the country attempting to topple any such re..."}

Scientists expected the impact to carve out a crater, hurl streams of rocks and dirt into space and, most importantly, alter the asteroid's orbit.\n\nTelescopes around the world and in space aimed at the same point in the sky to capture the spectacle.\n\nDART’s radio signal abruptly ceased indicating that an impact had occurred. Still, it won’t be clear for days or even weeks how much the asteroid's path was changed.\n\nNASA POSTPONES DECISION ON ROLLING ARTEMIS I BACK TO THE VEHICLE ASSEMBLY BUILDING DUE TO TROPICAL STORM IAN\n\nThe $325 million mission was the first attempt to shift the position of an asteroid or any other natural object in space.\n\nMonday's target was a 525-foot asteroid named Dimorphos, a moonlet of Didymos, which is a fast-spinning asteroid five times bigger that flung off the material that formed the junior partner. The pair have been orbiting the sun for eons without threatening Earth.\n\nA feed from NASA showing the impact.(NASA)\n\nThe DART spacecraft, launched in November, navigated to its target using new technology developed by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, the spacecraft builder and mission manager.\n\nIts on-board camera, a key part of this smart navigation system, caught sight of Dimorphos barely an hour before impact.\n\nWith an image beaming back to Earth every second, ground controllers in Laurel, Maryland, watched with growing excitement as Dimorphos loomed larger and larger in the field of view alongside its bigger companion.\n\nJAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE CAPTURES STUNNING IMAGE OF NEPTUNE, RINGS\n\nA mini satellite followed a few minutes behind to take photos of the impact. The Italian Cubesat was released from DART two weeks ago.\n\nScientists insisted DART would not shatter Dimorphos. The spacecraft packed a scant 1,260 pound, compared with the asteroid's 11 billion pounds. But that should be plenty to shrink its 11-hour, 55-minute orbit around Didymos.\n\nThis illustration made available by Johns Hopkins APL and NASA depicts NASA's DART probe, foreground right, and Italian Space Agency's (ASI) LICIACube, bottom right, at the Didymos system before impact with the asteroid Dimorphos, left.(Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA via AP)\n\nThe impact should pare 10 minutes off that, but telescopes will need anywhere from a few days to nearly a month to verify the new orbit.\n\nPlanetary defense experts prefer nudging a threatening asteroid or comet out of the way, given enough lead time, rather than blowing it up and creating multiple pieces that could rain down on Earth. Multiple impactors might be needed for big space rocks or a combination of impactors and so-called gravity tractors, not-yet-invented devices that would use their own gravity to pull an asteroid into a safer orbit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSignificantly less than half of the estimated 25,000 near-Earth objects in the deadly 460-foot range have been discovered, according to NASA.

At issue inGonzalez v. Googleis whether Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects internet platforms when their algorithms target users and recommend someone else’s content. Google and its supporters warned in legal briefs that a ruling against them could massively reshape legal liability for tech companies across the county, but after nearly three hours of argument on Tuesday, the justices appeared wary of taking such a significant step.\n\nThe case was filed by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old American woman who was studying in Paris when she was killed in an ISIS attack there in 2015. Their lawsuit alleges that Google, which owns YouTube, violated the Antiterrorism Act’s ban on aiding and abetting terrorism by (among other things) recommending ISIS videos to users through its algorithms, thereby aiding ISIS’s recruitment.\n\nRepresenting the Gonzalez family, law professor Eric Schnapper told the justices that Section 230 distinguishes between claims that seek to hold internet companies liable for content created by someone else, and claims that seek to hold internet companies liable for their own conduct. Whether an internet company’s recommendations would fall within the latter category would depend on whether they met specific criteria outlined in the text of Section 230, Schnapper contended. But he faced a barrage of questions from justices across the ideological spectrum.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas haswrittenskepticallyin recent years about broad immunity under Section 230, but he appeared surprisingly sympathetic to the theory on which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit relied in ruling for Google below – the idea that Section 230 protects recommendations as long as the provider’s algorithm treats content on its website similarly. If the same algorithm that recommends ISIS videos based on a user’s history and interests also recommends cooking videos to someone who is interested in cooking, Thomas asked, how can Google be held responsible for those recommendations?\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch was skeptical, however, about what he dubbed the 9th Circuit’s “neutral tools” test. Such a test “isn’t anywhere in” Section 230, he noted, and he pushed back against the idea that algorithms are necessarily neutral. In his view, the court should send the case back to the lower court for another look. Gorsuch participated in the argument by telephone; he was feeling “a little under the weather,” according to a court spokesperson.\n\nRepresenting Google, lawyer Lisa Blatt told the justices that Section 230 provides immunity from claims that treat the defendant as a publisher. “All publishing,” Blatt continued, “requires organization” – precisely what Google does with its recommendations on YouTube. “Helping users find the proverbial needle in a haystack is an existential necessity on the Internet,” Blatt concluded.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson was perhaps most squarely in the Gonzalez family’s corner. In Section 230, she told Blatt, Congress was trying to protect internet platforms that were blocking and screening offensive materials. However, Jackson continued, you are arguing here that Section 230 protects platforms that are promoting offensive materials. “How,” Jackson asked Blatt, “is that even conceptually consistent with what Congress intended?”\n\nJustices Elena Kagan suggested that even if Section 230 is not well suited to address the current needs of today’s internet, such a task was best left to Congress, rather than the Supreme Court. “These are not, like, the nine greatest experts on the internet,” Kagan observed.\n\nKavanaugh echoed Kagan’s sentiment. He noted that Congress included broad language in Section 230, and that courts have unanimously interpreted that text to provide protection for conduct like YouTube’s. “Friend of the court” briefs supporting Google have warned of serious problems, including economic dislocation, if that understanding is upset, he observed. Is the Supreme Court, he queried, really the best institution to make these kinds of decisions?\n\nAnd Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested that the justices might not have to decide the question before them at all. On Wednesday, the justices will hear argument inTwitter v. Taamneh, a related case brought against Twitter by the family of a Jordanian citizen killed in an ISIS attack on a nightclub in Istanbul. Like the Gonzalez family, the Taamneh family filed its lawsuit under the Antit..."}

Several prominent athletes joined Trump and top administration officials, including allies such as friend and pro golferBryson DeChambeau; and others who’ve attracted controversy such as former New York Giants linebackerLawrence Taylor, a registered sex offender.\n\nFormer NFL football player Lawrence Taylor speaks as President Donald Trump, from left, Vice President JD Vance, Cody Campbell, WWE CCO Triple H and professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau listen during an event signing an executive order restarting the Presidential Fitness Test in public schools, Thursday, July 31, 2025, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nIt’s the latest athletics-related push from Trump, an avid golfer who remains enthralled with the world of sports. He played baseball in high school and plays golf almost every weekend. Much of the domestic travel he has done this year that is not related to weekend golf games at his clubs in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia was built around attending sporting events, including the Super Bowl, Daytona 500 and UFC matches.\n\nTell us about your memoriesof taking the Presidential Fitness Test.\n\n“I was always a person that loved playing sports. I was good at sports,” Trump said. “When you are really focused on sports, you’ve thought about nothing else. To an extent, this is one of the reasons I like golf. You get away for a couple of hours.”\n\nThe announcement also came as Trump readies the United States to host the 2025 Ryder Cup, 2026 FIFA World Cup games and the 2028 Summer Olympics. He also signed a different executive order earlier this monthmandating that federal authorities clarifywhether college athletes can be consideredemployees of the schoolsthey play for.\n\nTrump on Thursday said the council, known formally as the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, will also deal with various issues on college athletics, such as the transfer portal that has more easily allowed athletes to switch from school to school. The council, which will have up to 30 members, will also develop criteria for a Presidential Fitness Award. The fitness test will be administered by his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nIn the test, children had to run and perform situps, pullups or pushups and a sit-and-reach test, but the program changed in 2012. It evolved into the Youth Fitness Program, which the government said “moved away from recognizing athletic performance to providing a barometer on student’s health.” Then-first lady Michelle Obama also promoted her “Let’s Move” initiative focused on reducing childhood obesity through diet and exercise.\n\nThe Youth Fitness Test, according to aHealth and Human Services Department websitelast updated in 2023 but still online Thursday, “minimizes comparisons between children and instead supports students as they pursue personal fitness goals for lifelong health.”\n\nAmong those who joined Trump on Thursday, in addition to DeChambeau and Taylor, were Kansas City Chiefs kickerHarrison Butker; Swedish golferAnnika Sorenstam; and WWE chief content officer Paul “Triple H” Levesque, the son-in-law of Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order restarting the Presidential Fitness Test in public schools as Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, from left, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Vice President JD Vance, professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau, WWE CCO Triple H and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Western assessments of deaths among Russian commanders are slightly more conservative. One European diplomat familiar with Western intelligence assessments toldForeign Policyon Monday that at least five Russian generals had been killed, owing mostly to failures in electronic communications equipment that left them vulnerable to targeted strikes and to their efforts to get a large force of nearly 200,000 troops—many of them young conscripts—to follow orders by leading from the front.\n\n“They’re struggling on the front line to get their orders through,” said the European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss recent battlefield intelligence. “They’re having to go to the front line to make things happen, which is putting them at much greater risk than you would normally see.”\n\nThe European diplomat said the Russian death toll among general officers is up to a fifth of the number of commanders deployed in Ukraine, which Western intelligence officials estimate at 20 officers, making the military less able to operate and more bogged down. “It’s all about a lack of preparedness among the military,” the diplomat said. “They are asking for things to happen, and they are not happening.”\n\nWhile the war has featured almost no ship-to-ship combat, high-ranking naval officers appear to be getting killed in greater numbers. Over the weekend, a deputy Russian Black Sea Fleet commander, Andrey Paliy—who was set to be promoted to a one-star admiral rank—was shot dead by Ukrainian forces outside the besieged city of Mariupol.\n\nEarlier on Monda..."}

But the Times reported that “a possible explanation has emerged” because Dr. Larry Braunstein – who died in 2007 – told his now-anti-Trump children about his role.\n\n“His daughters say their father often told the story of coming to the aid of a young Mr. Trump during the Vietnam War as a favor to his father,” Elder wrote.\n\n\"It's articles like this that make me doubt that the Times has any ethics left at all.\"\n\nBraunstein’s daughters “shared the family’s account for the first time publicly” for the Times piece and admitted they don’t know whether or not their father actually examined Trump. They said it was a “favor” to Fred Trump, the father of the current president who owned the Queens building Braunstein worked out of.\n\n“No paper evidence has been found to help corroborate the version of events described by the Braunstein family,” the Times wrote nine paragraphs into the piece. Buried 30 paragraphs into the feature, the Times casually mentioned that “the daughters, both Democrats, say they are not fans of Mr. Trump.”\n\n“Braunstein’s daughters said their father left no medical records with the family, and a doctor who purchased his practice said he was unaware of any documents related to Mr. Trump,” the Times continued.\n\nMedia Research Center vice president Dan Gainor called it “astonishing” that the Times “is actively encouraging the family of deceased doctors to give their opinions on private medical records” for a hit piece.\n\n“We are to believe that people who were three or six [years old] at the time somehow know Trump's detailed medical history. I'm surprised the paper didn't arrange a séance and quiz the late doctor, too,” Gainor told Fox News.\n\nThe Times tracked down another doctor, who worked with Braunstein in the late 1990s, who claims his old colleague mentioned being treated well by the Trumps but “did not remember any discussions” related to the medical exemption. The paper added that it began the investigation “when an anonymous tipster suggested that a podiatrist who was a commercial tenant of Fred Trump’s had provided the medical documentation,” but no names were provided so the paper referenced “old city directories” to find the relatives of a doctor who fit the anonymous tipster’s description.\n\n“It's the perfect liberal story. Trump can deny it but because these are private records, the only way to refute it is to let the Times dig through his medical records. It's articles like this that make me doubt that the Times has any ethics left at all,” Gainor said.\n\nConservative strategist Chris Barron mocked the paper for running the story.\n\n“The New York Times is essentially indistinguishable from a gossip rag you’d find in the super market checkout line.”\n\n“The complete and total abdication of any basic journalistic standards continues,” Barron told Fox News.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump and for the Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2025 FOX News Network, LLC.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: 117 Dead Amid Ongoing Violence South Africa", "output": "Cyril Ramaphosa says ‘good number’ of those who planned violence and looting had been identified\n\nThe wave of protest and looting that swept across much ofSouth Africaover the past week was planned by enemies of democracy in a deliberate effort to sow chaos, the president has said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in some of the areas worst hit by the unrest, Cyril Ramaphosa said authorities had identified “a good number” of those who planned and coordinated the violence, the worst in South Africasince the end of the apartheid regimein 1994.\n\n“We will not allow anyone to destroy our democracy. This is a hard-fought-for democracy and we will not allow them to mess it up. We are ready to defend our country and to defend our democracy … We will not allow anarchy and mayhem to just unfold in our country,” Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe president’s visit to KwaZulu-Natal province was his first appearance on the ground since unrest broke out in the south-eastern province before spreading to Johannesburg, the commercial capital of the country, and other parts of the populous Gauteng province.\n\nThe violence has claimed at least 180 lives and caused massive economic damage.\n\nThe immediate trigger for the chaos was the imprisonment of the former president Jacob Zuma, who began a 15-month jail term last week. Zuma loyalists and close aides are among those suspected by authorities of organising the wave of violence. KwaZulu-Natal is the stronghold of the former leader, who faces a raft of corruption charges.\n\nThe protests evolved rapidly into wholesale looting of shopping malls but were also accompanied by attacks on communications facilities, railways, ports, roads and other critical infrastructure – targets that security experts say suggest a campaign of deliberate sabotage aimed at making the country ungovernable.\n\nMore than 10,000 soldiers are on the streets to reinforce overwhelmed police, with armoured vehicles deployed in some areas.\n\n“It is no longer just thuggery, this is economic sabotage … It is a threat to our people so you have to restore that freedom,” said the head of the armed forces, Lit Gen Rudzani Maphwanya, addressing soldiers in Alexandra, Johannesburg.\n\nPolice told reporters calm had been restored to Gauteng though sporadic looting of malls and stores including foreign-owned neighbourhood groceries continued in parts of KwaZulu-Natal. There were overnight reports of several incidents of arson targeting retail outlets.\n\nHowever, the 600km main road linking the commercial heart of the country to Durban, the biggest port and the centre of the violence, hasreopened after being blocked for days, allaying fears of shortages of food and fuel.\n\n“It is vitally important to proceed with extreme caution and to stay alert at all times,” saidthe highway authority in a tweeton Friday. Motorists were advised to use the road and others in KwaZulu-Natal only if necessary, said South Africa’s Automobile Association. Trains and many other services in the two provinces hit by the unrest were still restricted, however.\n\nThe extent of the devastation is far from clear. South Africa’s consumer goods regulatory body said earlier this week that more than 800 retail shops had been looted, while in KwaZulu Natal, goods worth between $400m and $1bn have been stolen or destroyed, according to initial industry estimates.\n\nMore than 200 shopping malls have been destroyed, damaged or looted, scores of telecommunication towers put out of action and port facilities reportedly damaged. Attacks on chemical plants have led to dangerous and polluting spills.\n\nDozens of factories producing food and medicine were also looted. This, combined with attacks on clinics, has left hundreds of thousands suffering chronic conditions without medication in KwaZulu Natal, which has some of the highest rates of HIV in the world.\n\nThe unrest has also disrupted South Africa’s much-delayed vaccine rollout and treatment of Covid cases as the country suffers a third wave of infections.\n\nOn Thursday, ministers said one of the alleged instigators of the unrest had been detained by law enforcement officers, and others were under surveillance.\n\nZuma was ousted by Ramaphosa in 2018 and handed himself over to police last week to serve a 15-month jail sentence for refusing to appear before a judicial inquiry investigating corruption during his nine-year rule.\n\nThejailing of the former presidentwas a significant victory for Ramaphosa, who leads a moderate and pragmatic faction of the ruling African National Congress party. In recent months, a series of senior figures who thrived under Zuma have been marginalised, hit with legal cases or forced to relinquish powerful posts.\n\nZuma’s core supporters say he is the victim of a witch-hunt orchestrated by political opponents. The 79-year-old former anti-apartheid fighter has hitherto remained popular among many poor South Africans, especially in KwaZulu-Natal."}

That list includes teachers.\n\nWith the agency’s ruling, the Biden administration is one step closer to implementing its plan to begin to offer booster shots to Americans,a campaignit had announced would begin this week. At this point, however, only boosters using the Pfizer vaccine can be considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This pandemic is dynamic and evolving, with new data about vaccine safety and effectiveness becoming available every day,” Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement announcing the authorization. “As we learn more about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including the use of a booster dose, we will continue to evaluate the rapidly changing science and keep the public informed.”\n\nWhile the FDA’s ruling means boosters will not currently be available to as broad a population as the Biden administration had hoped, the groups indicated could encompass a large proportion of the adult American population.\n\nThe CDC estimates that there are roughly 53 million Americans aged 65 and older. Another 17 million to 20 million people are health care workers. And as many as 100 million people are estimated to have medical conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness if they contract Covid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FDA’s statement said a broad array of essential workers — “health care professionals, teachers and day care staff, grocery workers and those in homeless shelters or prisons, among others” — should be eligible for boosters.\n\nA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\n\nOne group that did not make the cut was 16 and 17 year olds. Pfizer had applied for the booster for everyone 16 years of age and up, but did not provide any data to support the safety of a third shot in anyone under 18. The FDA’s advisory committee objected strenuously to their inclusion and the authorization for the booster is for people 18 and older.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech had requested a full license for their booster shot, which they hoped would be made available to anyone who had previously received their vaccine. They proposed the third shot be given at least six months after the second jab in the series.\n\nBut in a rigorous meeting last Friday, the expert panel that advises the FDA on vaccinesvoted againstrecommending that broad use, with members arguing there isn’t enough evidence to support the contention that everyone 16 and older who received the Pfizer vaccine needs to be boosted six months after their second shot. While the FDA isn’t bound to follow the advice of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee — known as VRBPAC for short — it generally does. And it has, more or less, in this situation.\n\nThe committee voted 16 to 2 against boosters for all at this point. But it voted 18 to 0 in favor when asked if the evidence supports giving a third dose to people over the age of 65 and to people at high risk of developing severe Covid, if they contract the disease. The question did not stipulate who qualified as high risk, though there was discussion about people who are frequently exposed to Covid, like health care and front-line workers, and people with medical conditions like obesity and diabetes that have been linked to a higher risk of serious disease.\n\nFine-tuning who should be offered Pfizer booster doses at this time will now fall to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine expert panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It will vote on Thursday about whether to advise the CDC to recommend use of the booster jab, and which groups of people should be offered it at this point. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky will then have to sign off on ACIP’s recommendations. Like the FDA and its vaccines advisory committee, the CDC director is not obligated to follow ACIP’s advice, but almost always does.\n\nThe group met all day Wednesday to discuss Covid vaccine efficacy data and the evidence for waning of protection, among other issues.

The parties’ successes in that effort could determine whether taxes and spending grow, climate-change polices are approved or access to abortion is expanded or curtailed.\n\nRepublicans need to gain just five seats to take control of the U.S. House in the 2022 elections — a margin that could potentially be covered through artful redistricting. As they did after the 2010 census, Republicans will hold greater sway in more states over the redistricting process.\n\n“The question is going to be how creative this new data will force Republicans to get in maintaining or expanding their advantages, given an increasingly diverse, increasingly urban population,” said Joshua Blank, research director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas.\n\nTexas will be a major focal point in redistricting.\n\nThe Census Bureau said five of the 14 U.S. cities that grew by at least 100,000 people are located in Texas — Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. Four of the nation’s 10 fastest growing cities also were Texas suburbs — Frisco and McKinney near Dallas; Conroe near Houston, and New Braunfels near San Antonio. All are prime battle grounds for redistricting.\n\nBy contrast, many Texas counties outside of its metropolitan areas saw populations decline, the Census Bureau said.\n\nRepublicans, who currently hold 23 of the 36 U.S. House seats in Texas, will have full control over the redistricting process, allowing them to decide where to draw the two new seats the state is gaining. But that could be complicated because Democrats generally have fared better in Texas suburbs in recent elections.\n\nThough Republican Donald Trump carried Texas by more than 6 percentage points in the 2020 presidential election, he and Democrat Joe Biden essentially split voters who identified as subur..."}

Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn requested the emergency debate Monday night.\n\nRelated articleReports of Theresa May's demise may no longer be exaggerated\n\nMay admitted that “there remains widespread and deep concern” over the Northern Ireland backstop. The backstop is an arrangement designed to ensure there is no return to a “hard border” between Ireland, which will remain part of the European Union after Brexit, and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the bloc next March.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s secretary of state said she supported the decision to delay the vote.\n\n“Clearly, having listened to colleagues across the House, there is more work to be done to provide reassurances on the Northern Ireland-Ireland backstop,” MP Karen Bradley said in a statement. “I am convinced that leaving the EU without an agreement would be disastrous for Northern Ireland and potentially for the long-term future of the Union. I am not prepared to take risks with or gamble the Union of the United Kingdom.”\n\nThe prime minister said she had hoped changes secured to the backstop, to avoid being trapped in it indefinitely, would be enough for MPs.\n\n“I spoke to a number of EU leaders over the weekend and, in advance of the European Council, I will go to see my counterparts in other member states and the leadership of the council and the commission. I will discuss with them the clear concerns that this House has expressed,” May said.\n\n“We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow and not proceed to divide the House at this time,” May added.\n\nOn Tuesday morning May will travel to The Hague to hold a bilateral meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Downing Street said.\n\nIt will be part of May’s plan to seek “assurances” from EU leaders, which she can then convey to the UK Parliament to pass her Brexit deal.\n\nCorbyn called her agreement a “botched deal” before adding that “our country deserves better than this.”\n\n“The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray,” Corbyn said. “It’s been evident for weeks that the prime minister’s deal did not have confidence of this House yet she plowed on regardless, reiterating ‘this is the only deal available.’”\n\nThe leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, confirmed the vote was no longer on the House voting schedule after May’s statement.\n\nThe uncertainty over the future of Brexit caused sterling to plummet Monday to its weakest level in a year-and-a-half.\n\nUK parliamentarians were supposed to be given the opportunity to approve or reject the deal in a so-called “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.\n\nIn recent weeks, May had been trying to win support for her agreement but, with a high number of her own Conservative Party MPs opposed to it, she didn’t appear to be having much success.\n\nThere was confusion and anger as May hit the pause button on the vote.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the EU “will not renegotiate the deal including the backstop” and stressed that “as time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.”\n\nTusk added that the EU is “ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.”\n\nI have decided to call#EUCOon#Brexit(Art. 50) on Thursday. We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification. As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.\n\nIn a post on Twitter before May spoke, EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt expressed his frustration at the vote’s stalling.\n\n“This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people & businesses.

But there’s a more ambitious approach\n\nWe’re sanctioning Russian oligarchs up the wazoo, hoping it’s a way to get Putin to stop his deadly attack on Ukraine.\n\nBut for this tactic to work, two conditions must be met: first, the US and our allies must be able to locate and tie up Russian oligarchic wealth. Second, Russian oligarchs must have enough power to stop Putin.\n\nLet’s take them one at a time:\n\nAnecdotally,sanctions on the oligarchs appear to be working. Last Sunday, the billionaire industrialist Oleg Deripaska (on the US sanctions list) and banker Mikhail Fridman (on the EU’s)bothpublicly urged an end to Putin’s war.\n\nBillionaire businessman Roman Abramovich has put his English soccer club up for sale andvowed to donate the proceedsto “all victims of the war in Ukraine”. Banker and entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov told his 634,000 Instagram followers last week that “innocent people are dying in Ukraine now, every day, this is unthinkable and unacceptable”.\n\nBut are these sanctions really biting? This is where a comparison of Russian oligarchs with American oligarchs comes in.\n\nWhile Russian oligarchs (Russia’s richest 0.01%) have hidden an estimated$200bnoffshore (over half of their financial wealth), American oligarchs – America’s 765 billionaires – have hidden$1.2tn(about 4% of their wealth), mostly to avoid paying taxes on it.\n\nWhile American oligarchs park their income and wealth in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Russian oligarchs have hidden their most valuable assets in the United States and the European Union. The reason they do so is telling: western democracies follow the rule of law.\n\nUnder the rule of law, before a government can seize property it must follow lengthy and elaborate legal processes. As a result, American and European governments are finding their hands tied in actually taking control of the assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nAmerican law makes it difficult even to discover what Russian oligarchs own in the US because they’ve hidden their assets behind complex trusts and shell corporations.\n\nAmerican laws governing taxes, corporations, transportation and banking are wonderfully convenient for the world’s oligarchs.One out of every six aircraftin the United States, for example, is registered through trusts, Delaware corporations and even post office box addresses, making it almost impossible to discover their true owners.\n\nThis isn’t an argument against sanctioning Russian oligarchs. It’s just that we need to be clear-eyed about how difficult it is to do so.\n\nAmerican oligarchs have enormous political clout. In the 2012 presidential election (the most recent for which we have detailed data on individual contributions), the richest 0.01% of Americans – the richest 1% of the richest 1% – accounted for40% of all campaign contributions.\n\nWhat have American oligarchs got out of these campaign contributions? The lowest tax rates on the highest incomes in over a generation – and the lowest among all wealthy nations. They’ve also gotten an IRS so starved of resources it’sbarely able to enforce the law.\n\nRussian oligarchs who have pledged loyalty to Putin arguably havelesspolitical power in Russia than do American oligarchs in the US.\n\nIn Putin’s Russia, power is exercised by a narrow circle of officials and generals appointed by Putin, whom he has drawn largely from the former KGB. According to several Russian specialists I’ve spoken with over the last few days, this circle has become very small in recent months, now numbering perhaps a half dozen.\n\nWe should use whatever means are at our disposal to makeVladimir Putinend the brutal war he started. But it is proving difficult to use sanctions onspecificoligarchs to get Putin to stop.\n\nPerhaps we should be more ambitious. My Berkeley colleague Gabriel Zucmanrecommendsthat the US and the European Union freeze all offshore holdings of Russian nationals in excess of $10m. This would affect about 10,000 to 20,000 Russians who have benefited the most from Putin’s rule.\n\nMeanwhile, blanket sanctions against the Russian economyarehaving an effect. Over the past week they have causedthe rouble to collapse and decimated Russian markets.\n\nBut the burden has fallen mostly on ordinary Russians, many of whom have already suffered from Putin’s brutal regime.\n\nAs we’ve seen in North Korea and Iran, dictatorships don’t depend on popular approval. In fact, widespread hardship can lead to even more repression and violence. We should remind ourselves that Putin is not synonymous with the Russian people.\n\nRobert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author ofSaving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the FewandThe Common Good.

In normal times … monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks. However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher.”\n\nThat is a relatively hazy anxiety, since expectations change when the facts change. The University of Michigan survey of inflation expected over the next 12 month moves up down with monthly changes in reported actual inflation overthe past 12 months(the infamous year-to-year change). That survey of expected inflation even moves up and down with contemporary changes in the price ofgasoline.\n\nWhat we know we almost perfect certainty is that every time in U.S. postwar history that monetary policy has added the burden of rising interest expense to the burden of added energy expense (most recently in2004–2008), the result has always been recession.\n\nBut some will say that recession (always promised to be mild) is the price we must pay to get inflation down, which it does briefly while the recession is underway. But recessions always result in the Fed reversing course and slashing the fed funds rates ­– from 17.6% to 9% from April to July 1980 under Volcker, and from 5 ¼ % to zero in 2007-08 under Bernanke.\n\nThe difference between 9 hard landings and 4 soft landings in Fed interest rate cycles is that the Fed always starts cutting interest ratesbeforerecessions start in soft landings, and always starts too late in hard landings.\n\nSign up for the newsletter to receive periodic updates on Cato research, events, and\n          publications.\n\nView All Newsletters"}

That marks a step back fromDecember’s 3.4% rateand a dramatic cooling from the6.4% increase seen in January 2023.\n\nOn a monthly basis, CPI rose by 0.3% in January, with stubbornly high shelter costs accounting for two-thirds of the gain, according to the BLS.\n\nFalling gas prices helped out consumers’ wallets last month; however, food prices rose 0.4% from December, the highest monthly rate in a year. While food pricesare no longer outpacing overall inflation, they’re hitting the hardest at the restaurant level, where inflation is up 5.1% annually, versus the grocery store, where prices are 1.2% higher year-over-year.\n\nMonthly food price changes are volatile and can be influenced by a variety of factors, includingweather eventsanddisease, but they moved in the wrong direction for many Americans.\n\n“Food prices kept going up, and that’s a real pain point,” Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN. “There’s the rate of inflation, which is coming down, then there’s the weight of inflation, which continues to mount. So even if you have 3%, that’s 3% on top of a mountain of inflation people are already carrying.”\n\nEconomists were expecting inflation to ease to 0.2% from December and slow to 2.9% annually, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\n\nOverall inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has risen at 3% or above for 34 months in a row — the longest streak since the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n“Of course [3%] is an arbitrary measure, but that’s the way that humans think about it” in hopes that it shows clear progress, Frick said.\n\nStill, the January CPI report marked “significant progress” in the fight to bring down inflation, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday during an address in Pittsburgh.\n\n“Overall inflation is down by around two-thirds since its peak; the prices of key household expenses like gas, egg[s] and airline fares have gone down,” she said, noting CPI inflation is down 6 percentage points from its peak.\n\nWhile the CPI is a closely watched measure of how inflation is affecting consumers in their day-to-day living expenses, the Fed uses the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index as the basis for its 2% inflation target. In December, the PCE price index and the core PCE price index were up 2.6% and 2.9% annually, respectively.\n\nThe Commerce Department will release January PCE data on February 29.\n\nAnnual price increases surged post-pandemic, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. In its battle to bring down that inflation, the Federal Reserve introduced 11 aggressive rate hikes, starting in March 2022, meant to crush demand and discourage spending.\n\nExcluding the more volatile categories of food and energy, the core CPI index rose 0.4% from December, and the annual rate didn’t budge from the 3.9% increase reported a month before.\n\nTuesday’s CPI report showed that used car prices fell as expected in January, tumbling 3.4% on a monthly basis, reflecting declines in wholesale prices and pulling back from the increases seen in November and December.\n\n“On the goods side, you basically have zero inflation, month to month and year on year,” Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, told CNN in an interview. “What’s keeping inflation from falling faster, it’s all on the services side.”\n\nInflation can be much “stickier” in services-oriented businesses, particularly because of the heavier influences of wages and other labor costs. It’s one of the reasons why restaurant price inflation is up 5.1% annually versus the 1.2% year-over-year gain at the grocery store.\n\nThere’s also a ratchet effect: Once prices go up for that hair cut or vet visit, they don’t typically move back down.\n\nHowever, one of the biggest drivers of services inflation is one of the biggest and most essential items for Americans: shelter.\n\nThe CPI’s measurement of shelter costs does come with a delay from the timing in how BLS captures the data (which is largely by measuring rental leases as well as the implicit rental value of owner-occupied properties). There’s also a natural lag effect, as leases are typically renewed every 12 months or so.\n\nBeyond the mathematical factors, what’s happening in real life isn’t helping as much as initially expected:Rent prices are moderating some but not enough; plus, home prices didn’t fall as expected —instead, they’ve hit record highs.\n\n“Many forecasts had home prices dropping 3% to 4% in 2023; that certainly didn’t happen,” Frick said. “We’re in kind of a ‘Waiting for Godot’ situation h..."}

The DOJ claims the US company—which WIRED, along with other news outlets, was able to identify as Tenet Media but goes unnamed in the indictment—posted hundreds of videos on social media that pushed Kremlin-approved talking points.\n\nWith the tagline “Fearless voices live here,” Tenet Media’s network includes online creators known for their right-wing politics, including Johnson, Pool, Dave Rubin, and Lauren Southern. In addition to the followings of the network’s individual creators, which collectively number in the millions, Tenet Media itself boasts more than 315,000 followers on YouTube and thousands more across Facebook, Instagram, X, and TikTok.\n\nJohnson, Pool, Rubin, and Southern did not immediately respond to requests for comment; none are accused of wrongdoing. “We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment,” Johnsonwroteon X, referring to himself and his lawyers, “which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme.” Pool also released astatementon X, saying in part that “should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims.” Rubin retweeted Pool’s post.\n\nProsecutors say in the indictment that Tenet and its founders—who also go unnamed in the indictment but are right-wing influencer Lauren Chen and her husband, Liam Donovan, according to corporate records—actively concealed the company’s links to Russia from the individual creators.\n\nTenet allegedly received some $9.7 million from RT,according to the DOJ. Of that, $8.7 million went to the production companies of three unnamed commentators, the indictment claims. One, referred to as “Commentator-1”—the description appears to be of either Johnson or Rubin—was allegedly contracted for $400,000 per month for four weekly videos. The nearly $10 million Tenet Media allegedly received from RT “represents nearly 90%” of funds deposited in the company’s accounts, the DOJ claims.\n\nThe Justice Department identifies Tenet Media only as “US Company-1” but notes in the indictment that the company describes itself as a “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.” That language is identical to the description onTenet Media’s website.\n\nTenet and Chen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Russian RT employees indicted by the US, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, allegedly worked with Tenet Media to produce hundreds of videos that support Russia’s aims. They are charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and conspiracy to commit money laundering for their alleged work with Tenet Media and associated activities.\n\nPosing as outside video editors, the pair were allegedly intimately involved in Tenet Media’s operations. Kalashnikov, for example, “monitored [Tenet Media’s] internal communications and edited content” published by the company, the indictment claims. Afanasyeva, who allegedly used the fake personas “Helena Shudra” and “Victoria Pesti” while working with Tenet Media, is said to have “edited, posted, and directed the posting” by Tenet Media and “provided day-to-day direction” to the company’s staff. Afanasyeva’s work with Tenet Media allegedly included instructing the company to post pro-Russian viewpoints, such as pushing a conspiracy theory that Ukraine and the US were responsible for a March terrorist attack at a music venue in Moscow.\n\nThe indictment claims that the founders were aware they were working with Russian nationals and did not register with the US attorney general “as an agent of a foreign principal, as required by law.” For example, the indictment claims the founders referred to the RT employees as “the Russians” in private messages with each other. When the company’s fake backer, “Eduard Grigoriann,” did not reply to a message about money, one of the founders allegedly Googled “time in Moscow.” One of the founders also allegedly worked directly with RT and its German subsidiary.\n\nThe creator referred to as “Commentator-1” is alleged to have pressed Chen and Donovan, the founders, for more information about “Grigoriann.” One of the founders, after pressing the RT employees for information, was told to send him a Linkedin page for Viewpoint Productions. A bare-bonesLinkedin pageunder that name says “We are free speech absolutists. We believe that free speech benefits humanity, and that the cure for negative speech allows more voices to be heard, rather than silencing or censorship” and links to aWordpress sitewith a default introduction in French and the name of the company misspelled.\n\nLater, one of the founders was allegedly provided a C..."}

This is a proud moment for the whole nation,” he said. “This was our right, and we achieved this right, and we would like to express our gratitude to almighty God for having brought us to this stage.”\n\nMujahid also said that the Taliban wanted to make the country “no longer a battlefield of conflict,” and added that anyone who fought against them has been pardoned. “Animosities have come to an end,” he said. “We don’t want any external or internal enemies… We want to live peacefully.”\n\nDuring the conference, Mujahid added that foreign countries and aid agencies would remain safe in Afghanistan, saying, “Your security is ensured, we will not allow anyone to do anything against you.” The reason the Taliban entered Kabul, he said, was because “the previous government was so incompetent. Their security forces could not do anything to ensure security … We had to enter Kabul to ensure the security of the residents.”\n\nThe Taliban spokesman then promised the formation of a new “strong, inclusive” government, one which would soon have functioning agencies. He said that women would not be discriminated against in Afghanistan and would work “shoulder to shoulder with us” within “our frameworks.” ​​The Taliban, Mujahid said, is “committed to the rights of women under the system of sharia (Islamic) law.”\n\nMujahid also added, “We are committed to the media within our cultural framework.”\n\nAnd that framework is quite clear: Nothing the media does should go against Islamic values. “The media should not work against national values and national unity,” Mujahid said. He also said that the Taliban would not promote drug smuggling or the production of narcotics.\n\nMujahid spent more than 20 minutes taking questions from journalists at the end of the conference, including women and international reporters. At one point, Mujahid asked for more questions from the conference’s international contingent. “Nobody is going to be treated with revenge,” Mujahid said, when asked about the treatment of Afghan contractors and translators who worked with international militaries in Afghanistan. “They are going to be safe. Nobody is going to be interrogated or chased … We have pardoned everybody.”\n\nThis peaceful and conciliatory tone from the Taliban stands in stark contrast to images of thousands of Afghans desperately attempting to flee Kabul, citing concerns of retribution and violence. Many women in Afghanistan have also expressedhorrorat the prospect of Taliban rule.\n\nAnd while pressed about the role of women in Afghanistan, Mujahid said they were waiting for the new government to form and laws to be made so that they could “observe those laws and regulations” as they related to the role of women.\n\nThe stunning and swift collapse of the Afghan government and military has so far been marked by critiques of the United States for poor planning that has possibly put hundreds of thousands of Afghan lives at risk. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, an agency that has documented U.S. failings in Afghanistan for more than a decade, issued adevastating reportcalling into question the basic ability of the U.S. government to engage in nation-building.\n\nIn a speech Monday, President Joe Biden continued to affirm the U.S. decision to pull out of Afghanistan. “I am deeply saddened by the facts we now face, but I do not regret my decision to end America’s war-fighting in Afghanistan,” said Biden. “American troops cannot, and should not, be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.”\n\nByAshley Fike\n\nByStephen Andrew Galiher\n\nByCaleb Catlin\n\nByAshley Fike\n\nByLauren Boisvert\n\nByAshley Fike\n\nByCaleb Catlin\n\nByStephen Andrew Galiher\n\nByCaleb Catlin"}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Russia Captures Europes Biggest Nuclear Plant", "output": "\"By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night.\"\n\nThat was the verdict of the US ambassador to the United Nations on Friday, after Russia attacked and seized a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.\n\nBuildings at the Zaporizhzhia plant - the largest in Europe -were damaged after it was hit by shelling.\n\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says that none of the safety systems at the plant were affected, and there was no release of radioactive material.\n\nBut it is still a very risky situation.\n\n\"For the first time this morning, I'm frightened,\" Sheffield University nuclear materials expert Prof Claire Corkhill told BBC News.\n\nAs well as the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russia has taken control of the now-retired Chernobyl plant - the site of the worst nuclear incident in history.\n\nExperts have stressed that there are important differences between the two plants.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia site is far more secure, according to Dr Mark Wenman of Imperial College London.\n\nHe says the reactor is in a steel-reinforced concrete building that can \"withstand extreme external events, both natural and man-made, such as an aircraft crash or explosions\".\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant also does not contain any graphite in its reactor.\n\nAt Chernobyl graphite caused a significant fire and was the source of the radiation plume that travelled across Europe.\n\nHowever, scientists say a military attack on the reactor itself isn't the only threat. Disruption to its electricity supply could also cause serious issues.\n\n\"You don't need to hit directly a plant to get a problem,\" said Olexi Pasiuk, deputy director of Ecoaction, an energy pressure group in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainians were in the process of taking the reactors offline to protect them. Only one of the six reactors operational at the power plant is now thought to be running.\n\nBut reactors cannot just be turned off like conventional energy supplies. They must be cooled slowly over 30 hours, which requires a constant electricity supply to the plant.\n\nA disruption to this supply - and therefore the cooling process - could lead to radiation leaking into the surrounding environment.\n\nA loss of cooling like this was experienced at Japan's Fukushima plant following the 2011 tsunami.\n\nIn that case a loss of power caused a meltdown in three of its nuclear reactors.\n\nIf people are exposed to leaked radiation it cancause severe immediate and long-term health impactsincluding cancer.\n\nThis was seen in 1986 atChernobyl.\n\nRussia may be trying to curb Ukraine's power capabilities, Prof Corkhill said.\n\n\"They're taking the rectors offline. This means they're shutting down the nuclear reaction and putting them into a safe and stable state.\n\n\"And this could be the intention of the Russians: if you want to target their power supply, you attack a building close to the power plant and force operators to shut it down.\"\n\nThere are four major nuclear plants in Ukraine, and the defunct Chernobyl.\n\nRussia has control of Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl and it is approaching a third site - the south Ukraine nuclear power plant.\n\nThere are also smaller plants and radioactive disposal sites which store waste material from nuclear power operations across Ukraine.\n\nOn 27 February, Russian missiles also reportedly hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's nuclear inspectorate said no radiation leaks were reportedand the plant was not directly damaged.\n\nFor now, Russian forces - who have blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs - have allowed staff to remain in the control room at Zaporizhzhia, to run operations.\n\nBut world leaders have accused the Kremlin of acting recklessly. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it could \"directly threaten the safety of all of Europe\", and Ukraine's president accused Russia of \"nuclear terror\".\n\nIAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \"We shouldn't wait for something like this to happen [again].\"\n\nHe plans to travel to Ukraine to negotiate with Russian forces for the safe operation of all power plants in Ukraine.\n\nAlex Ryzhuk, who was born in Dublin to Ukrainian parents, had been serving alongside military forces when he went missing and was presumed dead.\n\nA video has gone viral showing Russian soldiers openly driving into the city on civilian cars and motorbikes.\n\nPresident Vucic has traded barbs with the Kremlin amid differences over gas supplies and Serbia's arms trade.\n\nAnglesey is understood to have been chosen after UK ministers reached a decision on the site.\n\nThe comments by arguably the most senior US diplomat in Europe come as the UK and US look to boost economic ties.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View moreopinion articleson CNN.\n\nThis is the second year that Covid-19 has upended holiday travel, after nearly two long years of plans undone, loved ones unseen and life milestones unmarked. Now that vaccines are widely available in the United States, it’s especially frustrating that we are still held hostage to a pandemic fueled by the people who refuse to get vaccinated and by the policy choices of wealthy nationsnot to treatthis pandemic like a global pandemic and vaccinate the world.\n\nBut here we are, and despite the fact that the United Stateshassome of the highest Covid-19 case and death rates in the world, our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning US citizens toavoid travelto over a dozen countries andhas bannedvisitors from eight southern African countries. Not that Americans are all staying home: Some 2 million peopletraveledthrough US airports daily on December 16, 17 and 18 – more than double last year’s numbers, although still lower than pre-Covid-19 rates.\n\nFull disclosure: I was one of them. Like millions of people the world over, I’m taking a hard look at my own risk (including the risk I pose to others) and making careful choices about how and when to grab back some aspects of pre-Covid-19 life. Travel is often necessary for my job; it’s also one of my greatest joys and a requirement to see many of my loved ones, family members and closest friends.\n\nI’m vaccinated and boosted, and I’m in my 30s with no health problems, making me less susceptible to Covid-19 infection and making it extremely unlikely that I would getseriously illfrom Covid-19 and contribute to an overtaxed health care system. I avoided all unmasked and unnecessary indoor activities in the week before my trip, and tested negative before I traveled. I masked in the airport and on the plane and have avoided indoor gatherings and unmasked indoor activities since my arrival.\n\nI feel comfortable, in other words, getting back some of the joy, connection and novelty that has been sacrificed over the past two years. And others who have made responsible and pro-social choices – getting vaccinated and boosted, complying with indoor mask rules, testing regularly – should be able to do the same. White House Chief Medical Adviser Dr. Anthony Fauciagrees: “If I had to I would have no problem getting on an airplane,” he told CNBC. “I’m vaccinated. I’m boosted. I know we have to wear a mask on an airplane.”\n\nRelated articleHow we can learn to co-exist with Covid-19\n\nThe risk, he emphasized, is never zero, and there have been many breakthrough infections with the Omicron variant on the rise. Of course, every family needs to evaluate their individual circumstances and make their own risk assessment – plenty of vaccinated people aren’t comfortable traveling yet, and many have at-risk loved ones they’re worried about. And unfortunately, some unvaccinated people don’t hesitate to get on an airplane or share a meal inside, which ups the risk for everyone. “But for right now,” Fauci said, “people who are vaccinated and boosted should feel reasonably comfortable.”\n\nHealth is about avoiding disease, yes. But it’s also more holistic than that: If we want to be healthy people, we need other human beings; we need connection; we need touch; we need experiences that bring us pleasure, that challenge us and that expand our worldview.\n\nAnd liberals have long been better than conservatives at stressing harm reduction over abstinence because we know that, from sex tosubstance use, “Just say no” doesn’t work. This conclusion holds true for public health more broadly: Telling people to forgo pleasurable activities isn’t usually as effective as reducing risk and giving people the tools to be safer.\n\nWith an airborne virus, though, those tools can’t simply be on offer for individuals to take or reject – we all have to breathe the same air, and so we need policies that protect all of us. That’s where our leadership has utterly failed.\n\nRelated articleSports aren't playing offense on Covid\n\nIt was still striking, in planning for a trip, to see how much of this is left up to individual choice and risk calculus. Many countries still do not require vaccination for tourists and other visitors to enter. The Biden administration has tried to institute variousfederal vaccine mandatesfor certain categories of workers, but they don’t apply to a great many Americans and have been routinely challenged in court.\n\nWith a few exceptions like airports and airplanes, there are still no national rules mandating masks in high-risk settings, and many Republican-run states have made it illegal for employers or institutions to require eithervaccinationorindoor mask-wearing.\n\nTesting is also still a mess.

That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 5.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, compared with respective estimates of 6.1% and 0.5%.\n\nEven with the lower-than-expected numbers, inflation pressures remained strong.\n\nThe jump in the food index put the 12-month increase to 10.9%, the fastest pace since May 1979. Butter is up 26.4% over the past year, eggs have surged 38% and coffee is up more than 20%.\n\nDespite the monthly drop in the energy index, electricity prices rose 1.6% and were up 15.2% from a year ago. The energy index rose 32.9% from a year ago.\n\nUsed vehicle prices posted a 0.4% monthly decline, while apparel prices also fell, easing 0.1%, and transportation services were off 0.5% as airline fares fell 1.8% for the month and 7.8% from a year ago.\n\nMarkets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points and government bond yields down sharply.\n\n\"Things are moving in the right direction,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"This is the most encouraging report we've had in quite some time.\"\n\nThe report was good news for workers, who saw a 0.5% monthly increase in real wages. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings were still down 3% from a year ago.\n\nShelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, continued to rise and are up 5.7% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe numbers indicate that inflation pressures are easing somewhat but still remain near their highest levels since the early 1980s.\n\nClogged supply chains, outsized demand for goods over services, and trillions of dollars in pandemic-related fiscal and monetary stimulus have combined to create an environment of high prices and slow economic growth that has bedeviled policymakers.\n\nThe July drop in gas prices has provided some hope after prices at the pump rose past $5 a gallon. But gasoline was still up 44% from a year ago and fuel oil increased 75.6% on an annual basis, despite an 11% decline in July.\n\nFederal Reserve officials are using a recipe of interest rate increases and related monetary policy tightening in hopes of beating back inflation numbers running well ahead of their 2% long-run target. The central bank has hiked benchmark borrowing rates by 2.25 percentage points so far in 2022, and officials have provided strong indications that more increases are coming.\n\nThere was some good news earlier this week when a New York Fed survey indicated that consumers have pared back inflation expectations for the future. But for now, the soaring cost of living remains a problem.\n\nWhile inflation has been accelerating, gross domestic product declined for the first two quarters of 2022. The combination of slow growth and rising prices is associated with stagflation, while the two straight quarters of negative GDP meets a widely held definition of recession.\n\nWednesday's inflation numbers could take some heat off the Fed.\n\nRecent commentary from policymakers has pointed toward a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike at the September meeting. Following the CPI report, market pricing reversed, with traders now anticipating a better chance of a lesser 0.5 percentage point move.\n\n\"At the very least, this report takes the pressure off the Fed at the next meeting,\" Markowska said. \"They've been saying they're ready to deliver a 75 basis point hike if they have to.

In remarks at a conservation summit in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, the president called the landscape “a place of reverence. It’s a place of spirituality. It’s a place of healing.”\n\n“And now it will be recognized for the significance it holds and be preserved forever,” he said.\n\nIn a roughly 6,000-word proclamation, Biden designated the land under his authority using the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law that allows the president to protect land for its cultural and natural resources. On Tuesday, the president alsodesignated a monumentoutside of El Paso, Texas.\n\nThe Avi Kwa Ame National Monument will include mountains and valleys in the area around Spirit Mountain, connecting already protected areas of Joshua tree forests and wildlife habitat in places such as the Castle Mountain National Monument and Mojave Wilderness.\n\nLandscape-scale protections were a priority for the Honor Avi Kwa Ame coalition, as the areas and ecosystems emanating from Spirit Mountain are considered interwoven with each other.\n\n“For the Tribal Nations that trace their creation to Avi Kwa Ame,” Biden’s proclamation stated, “the power and significance of this place reside not just in the mountain itself, but radiate across the valleys and mountain ranges of the surrounding desert landscape containing the landmarks and spiritually important locations that are linked by oral traditions and beliefs.”\n\nWith the national monument established, federal officials with the U.S. Department of Interior will work on creating a management plan for the area. Notably, the proclamation directs Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to work with tribal nations to develop policies for co-stewardship of the monument and create an agreement to give tribal governments a greater role in management decisions.\n\nAt the conservation summit, Timothy Williams, the chairman of the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe, said the “Mojave people, known as the People by the River, hold Avi Kwa Ame in our hearts.”\n\n“It is a place we know as our creation,” he said in a speech. “It is the beginning of our traditional songs. And it is the place that Native nations throughout the Southwest hold sacred.”\n\nAvi Kwa Ame, which stands above the Colorado River to the east, marks an area considered sacred and significant by the Mojave, Chemehuevi, Southern Paiute, Cocopah, Halchidhoma, Havasupai, Hopi, Haulapai, Kumeyaay, Maricopa, Pai Pai, Quechan, Yavapai and Zuni people.\n\nThe monument received the backing of the Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona, which represents 21 tribes, and the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada, which represents 27 tribes. It also was supported by local governments, including Clark County, Henderson, Searchlight, Laughlin and Boulder City. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) all backed the plan, as well as former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak.\n\nClark County, in a statement, said it “recognizes the need to maintain the beauty of this sacred land and has supported efforts to protect the landscape through a resolution by the Board of County Commissioners.” The county is reviewing the proclamation to “understand the impact to our region, both in its size as well as the operations of Harry Reid International Airport.”\n\nRepublican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who was inaugurated after proposals for the monument had largely been finalized, expressed vocal opposition for the Avi Kwa Ame designation.\n\nIn a scathing statement, Lombardo said that the Biden administration had not consulted his administration after taking office and said the plan, because of its size, “seems badly out of step.”\n\nLombardo said he raised concerns with the White House that the proposal could conflict with rare earth mining projects and other “long-planned, bipartisan economic development efforts,” a likely reference to solar and wind projects that had been proposed within the monument area.\n\n“This kind of ‘Washington Knows Best’ policy might win plaudits from unaccountable special interests, but it’s going to cost our state jobs and economic opportunity — all while making land more expensive and more difficult to develop for affordable housing and critical infrastructure projects,” Lombardo said in the statement on Tuesday, calling the designation a “federal confiscation” and a “historic mistake that will cost Nevadans for generations to come.”\n\nOver the past few months, energy developers had pushed to exempt certain areas from the monument boundary proposed by the Honor Avi Kwa Ame coalition and..."}

If successful, that would potentially result in the declaration of a \"keep-out zone,\" which could inhibit the United States from establishing a presence there.\n\n\"There are very specific areas of the moon that are critical that who gets there first gets to plant their flag,\" Duffy recently said on \"Hannity.\" \"We know the Chinese want to get there as well, so speed is of the essence.\"\n\nThe move means that NASA will continue to have input in nuclear development, despite the Pentagon’s recent cancellation of a joint program on nuclear-powered rocket engines.\n\nThe agency will be required to solicit proposals for a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor to launch by 2030, around the time China intends to put aman on the moon, within 60 days of the directive.\n\nDuffy spoke with Fox News about how NASA's Artemis program aims to return Americans to the Moon.\n\n\"We're going to set up a base camp,\" Duffy said. \"And what we learn on the moon is going to take us to Mars.\"\n\nDuffy also issued another directive to quickly replace the International Space Station, a priority for NASA.

At a minimum, the White House is still in discussions to sell nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia despite fierceDemocratic opposition.\n\nOn the surface, the proposed nuclear deal makes sense: An American business would make a lot of money — possiblybillions of dollars— selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, and Riyadh would get a new energy source to power its economy.\n\nBut the problem, as some White House officials warned those involved, is that Flynn and Barrack’s scheme was potentially illegal.\n\nFor the US to sell nuclear technology to a foreign country, it must sign what’s known as a “123 agreement.” That comes from Section 123 of the1954 US Atomic Energy Act, which establishes the criteria for the US to sell nuclear materials to other countries.\n\nIf a country wants to buy nuclear equipment from the US — say, a nuclear reactor — it must meetnine conditions, including a guarantee that it will not use the technology to make nuclear weapons. Congress doesn’t have to approve the sale.\n\nBut according to the Democrats’report, Harvey, the senior National Security Council staffer (who is also a close Flynn ally), ignored all of that “and insisted that the decision to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia had already been made.”\n\nIf true, that means Harvey tried to make the deal happen without arranging for Saudi Arabia to sign the 123 agreement. That’s potentially dangerous, as that could allow Riyadh to pursue a nuclear weapon with US-sold equipment down the line.\n\nOn top of that, there’s also the issue of Michael Flynn’s personal involvement in the deal. Flynn used to consult for IP3, ad “whistleblowers” who spoke with House Democrats were concerned about the national security adviser skirting ethics rules.\n\nWhite House ethics officials apparently brought all of this up. According to the report, one senior political official apparently felt Harvey’s proposal was “not a business plan,” but rather “a scheme for these generals to make some money.” That same official then added: “Okay, you know we cannot do this.”\n\nClearly, their warnings were ignored — which may be why the whistleblowers spoke to congressional Democrats in the first place.\n\nAs I said earlier, the broad outlines of this scheme have already been known for a while now, thanks toreporting from the Wall Street Journaland others.\n\nFlynn’s history of pushing specific policieswhile being on the p..."}

He built his first app — a blackjack game — at computer camp when he was 13.\n\nHis newest app is designed for a very different purpose: to let users alert people nearby to sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their area.\n\nAaron launched the platform, called ICEBlock, in early April after watching President Donald Trump’s administration begin itsimmigration crackdown. The White House’s immigration policies have sparked mass protests across the United States; aCNN pollin April showed 52% of Americans polled said Trump has gone too far in deporting undocumented immigrants.\n\nICEBlock currently has more than 20,000 users, many of whom are in Los Angeles, where controversial, large-scale deportation efforts have taken place.\n\n“When I saw what was happening in this country, I wanted to do something to fight back,” Aaron told CNN, adding that the deportation efforts feel, to him, reminiscent of Nazi Germany. “We’re literally watching history repeat itself.”\n\nICEBlock is designed to be an “early warning system” for users when ICE is operating nearby, Aaron said. Users can add a pin on a map showing where they spotted agents — along with optional notes, like what officers were wearing or what kind of car they were driving. Other users within a five-mile radius will then receive a push alert notifying them of the sighting.\n\nRelated articleExclusive: New Trump administration plan could end asylum claims and speed deportations for hundreds of thousands of migrants\n\nAaron said he hopes those notifications will help people avoid interactions with ICE, noting that he does not want users to interfere with the agency’s operations. The app provides a similar warning when users log a sighting: “Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.”\n\nICE did not respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding the app or Aaron’s characterization of the agency’s activity prior to this story’s publication. On Monday, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons released a statement criticizing CNN’s report and saying that ICEBlock “basically paints a target on federal law enforcement officers’ backs” and that “officers and agents are already facing a 500% increase in assaults.”\n\nICEBlock doesn’t collect personal data, and users are completely anonymous, according to Aaron. It’s only available on iOS because Aaron says the app would have to collect information that could ultimately put users at risk to provide the same experience on Android.\n\nReassuring users of those privacy protections will likely be key to growing ICEBlock’s user base, given how the government is building adatabaseto aid in its deportation efforts.\n\n“We don’t want anybody’s device ID, IP address, location,” Aaron said. “We don’t want anything being discoverable. And so, this is 100% anonymous and free for anybody who wants to use it.”\n\nAlthough ICEBlock has no surefire way of guaranteeing the accuracy of user reports, Aaron says he’s built safeguards to prevent users from spamming the platform with fake sightings. Users can only report a sighting within five miles of their location, and they can only report once every five minutes. Reports are automatically deleted after four hours.\n\nAaron says he has no plans to monetize the free app but rather wants it to be a service to the community.\n\nAaron’s work on ICEBlock stands in contrast to the support that some leaders in Silicon Valley have shown to Trump, including by donating to and attending his inauguration. Some companies have also announced investments in expanding their US presence following the president’s push for domestic tech manufacturing.\n\n“I think I would say grow a backbone. You can’t just be about the money,” Aaron said when asked what he would say to those tech leaders.\n\n“I understand that you have shareholders to report to. I understand that you have employees that need their paychecks,” he added. “But at what point do you say, ‘Enough is enough’?”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional content.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Other states, such as Florida, have done so through executive rulemaking. This is a positive first step towards reclaimingAmerican educationfrom openly anti-American pedagogy.\n\nThe intellectual roots of CRT can be found in Marxist-influenced critical theory, which began in the academia of Weimar Germany. It developed into an “intersectional” ideology at Harvard Law School in the late 1980s, through Kimberlé Crenshaw and other supporters of Professor Derrick Bell. In recent years, however, it has metastasized into the pop psychology of bestsellers such as Ibram X. Kendi’sHow to Be an Antiracistand Robin DiAngelo’sWhite Fragilityas well as pseudohistory such as theNew York Times’ 1619 Project.\n\nCRT teaches that American ideals and institutions are mere fronts for white supremacy. It instructs its devotees to see everything through the lens of racial group identity and inherited guilt rather than treat individuals as individuals. Along with related critical gender and sexuality theories, it has increasingly colonized workplace training, journalism, and campus culture, and more recently entered the curricula of K–12 schools, where its practitioners are embraced and showered with cash by left-leaning school boards and educator groups such as the National Education Association.\n\nK–12 education is where CRT has finally hit a popular backlash among American parents of all colors, who do not want their children indoctrinated in racial animosity and grievance, self-hatred, and crackpot history. The merest glimpse at public meetings on the topic, and the raw emotions of concerned parents, should disabuse anyone of the progressive notion that this is a concocted “Astroturf” movement put up by shadowy right-wing billionaires. It turns out that ordinary Americans and first-generation immigrants want their children to learn American ideals instead of Ivy League faculty-lounge jargon. They also do not appreciate the bullying and climate of fear that inevitably accompany CRT wherever it grows.\n\nState legislation is a blunt instrument, and many of the first-generation anti-CRT bills could be more carefully written. The long game should be more grassroots involvement in ensuring that schools teach American history and values with fairness and accuracy. That includes the many racial injustices in our history that have deviated from our founding ideals. It is not improper, censorious, or unconstitutional for the people to decide what should be taught to children by government employees in government schools on government property. In this case, common sense, and devotion to a truthful version of our history, demands nothing less.\n\nAbbas allegedly ordered the chemical abortion pills Mifepristone and Misopristol using an out-of-state telemedical abortionist.\n\nAs Oscar Wilde might have said, to lose one presidency over economic angst may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.\n\nConcerns such as mental health or body image issues are not contraindications to pediatric patients receiving hormone therapy, according to AAFP.\n\n‘With rising threats to free speech and open debate, the Federalist Society is celebrating the students who every day defend the Constitution.’\n\nIn one email, sent to author Michael Wolff in 2019, Epstein wrote, ‘Of course [Trump] knew about the girls.’\n\nOverwhelming majorities once believed that working hard and playing by the rules would grant the next generation a better life than their parents’.

My new strategy is geared toward mission advantage.”\n\nThe exchange was part of Wednesday’s hearing on what Republicans described from the outset as Mayorkas’ “border crisis.” The hearing took place in south Texas.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Ortiz underscored the challenges facing his agents amid an influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, telling lawmakers that in some areas, his agency faces “a crisis situation.”\n\n“The migration flow represents challenges, and in some areas, a crisis situation,” Ortiz said.\n\nThe chief also recalled theSeptember 2021 surgeof Haitians in Del Rio, Texas, calling it “chaotic.”\n\n“We had over 20,000 people show up in one place in a short period of time,” he said, adding that agents provided food and aid, and noting that he remains proud of horse patrol, whichcame under scrutiny.\n\n“I accepted and continue to accept full responsibility for the actions taken,” he added.\n\nIn January, the administration rolled out a new process that allows migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti to apply to come to the US. That process had previously been for Venezuelans. Those who don’t apply can be turned back under the Covid-era border restriction, known as Title 42.\n\nSince the process was implemented,encountersalong the US-Mexico borders have dropped to the lowest monthly amount since February 2021 and remained lower last month.\n\nDemocrats on the House Homeland Security committee did not attend the panel’s Wednesday field hearing in Texas. “Unfortunately, it has become clear that Republicans planned to politicize this event from the start, breaking with the Committee’s proud history of bipartisanship,” ranking member Bennie Thompson said in a statement to CNN Tuesday. White House spokesperson Ian Sams also accused Republicans of “playing partisan games at the border” and suggested that they should “honestly explain to (Ortiz) why they want to slash the funding needed to combat fentanyl trafficking, stop unlawful border crossings, and conduct other important law enforcement efforts at the border.”\n\nRepublicans have seized on Mayorkas’ previous comments in testimony that the department maintains operational control of the border, though the secretary recently explained the challenges in doing so.\n\nMayorkas told CNN’s Chris Wallacelast monththat his goal is to “achieve operational control” of the border.\n\nPressed by Wallace on what it means for the border to be secure and if it means people aren’t illegally crossing the border, Mayorkas said: “Of course not. By that measure, the border has never been secure, right?”\n\nAsked again by what measure the border is secure, Mayorkas said: “There is not a common definition of that. If one looks at the statutory definition, the literal interpretation of the statutory language, if one person successfully evades law enforcement at the border, then we have breached the security of the border.”\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

China reported to the World Health Organization that the first patient with Covid-like symptoms was recorded in Wuhan on December 8, 2019.\n\nTheWall Street Journal first reportedon the intelligence surrounding the earlier hospitalizations.\n\nImportantly, the intelligence community still does not know what the researchers were actually sick with, said the people briefed, and continues to have low confidence in its assessments of the virus’ precise origins beyond the fact that it came from China. “At the end of the day, there is still nothing definitive,” said one of the people who has seen the intelligence.\n\nThe director of the Wuhan National Biosafety Lab, which is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, issued a strong denial of the report on Monday.\n\n“I’ve read it, it’s a complete lie,” director Yuan Zhiming told state-run tabloid Global Times. “Those claims are groundless. The lab has not been aware of this situation, and I don’t even know where such information came from.”\n\nZhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, on Monday refuted the report and accused the US of “hyping up the lab leak theory.”\n\n“Through field visits and in-depth visits in China, the experts unanimously agreed that the allegation of lab leaking is extremely unlikely,” Zhao said.\n\nRelated articleAutopsy of a pandemic: 6 doctors at the center of the US Covid-19 response\n\nDirector of National IntelligenceAvril Haines told lawmakersduring the Worldwide Threats Hearing last month that “the intelligence community does not know exactly where, when, or how Covid-19 virus was transmitted initially,” an assessment that has not changed, said two of the people briefed on the intelligence.\n\nThe current intelligence reinforces the belief that the virus most likely originated naturally, from animal-human contact, the sources said. But that does not preclude the possibility that the virus was the result of an accidental leak from the Wuhan Institute, where coronavirus research was being conducted on bats.\n\nTheWorld Health Organization conducted an investigationinto the origins of the pandemic and concluded in a report that the risk of an accident was “extremely low.” The report said there was “no reporting of Covid-19 compatible respiratory illness during the weeks/months prior to December 2019, and no serological evidence of infection in workers through SARS-CoV-2-specific serology-screening.”\n\nDisease ecologist Peter Daszak, who worked on the WHO team, toldCNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Guptain February that “there is really still no evidence that this came from a lab.” He noted that researchers were tested and there was no evidence found of Covid antibodies, and said the lab was “very well run.”\n\n“It’s not a complete throwing out of that hypothesis,” Daszak said. “It’s a conclusion that it’s extremely unlikely and that there is a much more likely hypothesis out there.”\n\nBut the WHO probe was swiftly criticized by the US, UK, and other governments over its limited access to “complete, original data and samples.”\n\nThe organization was also accused of being overly deferential to China throughout the course of the study, which was co-authored by 17 Chinese scientists – several of them from state-run institutions.\n\nMembers of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long been investigating the origins of the pandemic, received a classified briefing on the matter last week, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Though my life was cut short, I want to keep inspiring others to make change.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn addition to answering questions from Acosta, the AI version of Joaquin asked multiple questions itself, inquiring as to Acosta’s favorite basketball team and his favorite moment from theStar Warsmovies.\n\nAfter the conversation with the AI avatar ended, Manuel Oliver joined the show to discuss the AI model of his son and its potential future.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAcosta told Oliver it was “inspiring” to “finally” speak to one of the children involved in a school shooting.\n\n“We’ve heard from the parents. We’ve heard from the politicians. Now we’re hearing from the kids, which is so important.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSeveral of the Parkland survivors, including David Hogg and X Gonzalez, went on to found the organization March for Our Lives, which held nationwide protests against gun violence in 2018 and 2022.\n\nNotably,Hogg appeared on CNN several times while Acosta was a reporter at the network.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOliver, whom Acosta referred to as a “good friend,” said that the avatar was “just the beginning” of what AI could do to represent his late son.\n\n“Joaquin is going to start having followers. He’s going to start uploading videos. It’s just the beginning,” Oliver said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOliver told Acosta that he has no illusions about the AI avatar actually being his late son.\n\n“I don’t want anyone to think in any way I’m trying to bring my son back. Sadly, I can’t. I wish I could.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJoaquin’s father told the Daily Beast that a New York-based AI company produced the avatar, and that the interview with Acosta was “the first ever interview with a victim of gun violence that’s not here.”\n\nTo make the avatar, Oliver provided the company with written materials Joaquin produced before he died, including fictional stories he wrote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOliver said that he understands why some parents would be hesitant to use the technology, however, he thinks the AI avatar of Joaquin could help bolster advocacy for gun reform.\n\nOn a deeper level, Oliver said that he savors his own interactions with the avatar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“As a father, just to be able to hear my son’s voice, that’s worth it, no matter the criticism,” Oliver said.\n\nStill, some critics found the AI-fueled interaction disturbing and disrespectful.\n\nRyan Saavedra, a reporter for the conservative outletThe Daily Wire,hammered Acosta on X for using an “AI chat bot” to “push partisan politics.”\n\nOn the left-leaning social media platform Bluesky, more than 3000 users responded to Acosta’s post announcing the episode—many of them critical of the episode.\n\nIn a comment that received more than 300 likes, one user lambasted Acosta as “an actual opportunistic ghoul.”\n\nAnother user, who received 900 likes, addressed Acosta directly and wrote, ”You’re interviewing ChatGPT, not Joaquin Oliver. Don’t p--- on my leg and tell me it’s raining.\"\n\nThe backlash was sufficiently strong that Acosta posted a video on his Bluesky account of Manuel Oliver defending the creation of the AI avatar and its use on the show.\n\n“His son would be 25 today,” Acosta wrote in the caption accompanying the video, referring to Joaquin’s birthday of August 4.\n\n“If the problem you have is with the AI, then you have the wrong problem,” Manuel Oliver said in the video. In recent years, Oliver has become an outspoken advocate for gun reform and founded the organization Change the Ref.\n\n“The real problem is that my son was shot 8 years ago.”\n\nAcosta defended his ..."}

It now seems highly unlikely that a recession will materialize before 2023, and maybe not even then.\n\nPart of the problem: A lot of us are watching the wrong pots heat up.\n\nEach time a negative economic report comes out, it fans the flames of recessionary worry, but a lot of those indicators and releases don’t factor directly into the recession/expansion calculations.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, a nongovernmental group composed largely of university economists, is the organization that determines when recessions arrive and how long they endure. Here’s what they focus on and what they largely ignore:\n\nThe backdrop for all of the economic angst of late has been the spike in inflation this year and Federal Reserve efforts to quash it by raising interest rates aggressively. Inflation has been trending slightly lower since midsummer, but the fight isn’t over, with at least a couple more rate hikes probable for at least a few more months.\n\nBut inflation and interest rates aren’t factors that the NBER economists focus on, at least directly. Interest rates are tracked in other economic gauges, such as the index of leading economic indicators, and they certainly matter.\n\nRead more by Russ Wiles:Make these tax moves before the end of the year to save you money\n\nOne rule-of-thumb gauge, known as the inverted yield curve, is flashing recessionary warning signals right now. Normally, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates, and when this relationship reverses, it’s seen as a cause for alarm, for various reasons.\n\nRecently, six-month Treasury bills yielded about 4.7%, compared with 3.8% for 30-year Treasury bonds, an abnormally wide and potentially alarming pattern. The inverted yield curve has a good historic track record of coinciding with recessions, and some economists are predicting a recession based on this measure. But it’s not a factor directly examined by the NBER.\n\nSo, too, for asset prices — from stocks and housing to cryptocurrency — all of which have weakened this year. But they’re not directly tracked by the NBER on its recession watch, either. The stock market in particular often tumbles on recession fears, but these downturns aren't always followed by economic slumps.\n\nThe NBER says its economists focus on six measures that can be simplified as follows: personal income less transfers, personal consumption/spending, retail/wholesale sales and industrial production, plus two measures of national employment/unemployment.\n\n“There is no fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in our decisions,” the bureau explained on its website. However, “in recent decades, the two measures we have put the most weight on are real personal income less transfers and nonfarm payroll employment,” it said.\n\nThe bureau often makes recession determinations many months after a downturn started, and it is cautious in its calls. The NBER economists are looking for signs of a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”\n\nThat isn’t the case currently. Over the past six months through September, five of the six measures have shown gains (with wholesale/retail sales the exception), reports J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which tracks the indicators monthly. None of the six has shown much change, up or down, over that stretch.\n\nThe economy is like a giant oil tanker that usually takes a lot of time to change course, and it’s still moving forward. Notably, the NBER points out that “expansions are the normal state of the economy” and that “most recessions are brief.”\n\nAll of this doesn’t mean boom times are at hand. Millions of Americans are feeling economic pain. Income inequality has been widening, for example, and there are fresh signs that many people are running up credit card balances and having trouble paying off debts. And the Fed continues to tighten the screws.\n\nYet jobs remain plentiful, which is perhaps the key litmus test of recessions.\n\nEconomic downturns usually coincide with periods of mass layoffs that swell the ranks of the unemployed. Think back to peak recessionary jobless rates of 10% in 2009 or 14.7% in 2020, for example.\n\nLayoffs have started to rise lately, notably in parts of the technology sector, but they’re hardly widespread. The U.S. jobless rate, which stood at 3.7% in the latest reading as of October, is actually slightly below where it started the year, despite Fed efforts to push it higher.\n\nNor have consumers turned off the cash spigots. The holiday shopping season is off to a robust start, with the National Retail Federation estimating a record 197 million Americans made purchases online or in stores over the long Thank..."}

But can the president's lofty goals be met? Here's everything you need to know:\n\nThe agenda, titled \"All In: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent Homelessness,\" was unveiled by the Biden administration as the next iteration of the federal effort to stop homelessness. Produced by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) in conjunction with 19 federal agencies, this federal strategic plan sets the ultimate goal ofreducing homelessness in the U.S.by 25 percent by 2025.\n\nAccording to the USICH, \"All In\"was developed using a wide swath of data points and research, including input from more than 1,500 comments and dozens of listening sessions from people who have experienced homelessness.\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

The statement noted that the plan will work to build on the foundation established by \"Opening Doors,\"the homelessness plan unveiled by the Obama-Biden administration in 2010.\n\n\"My plan offers a roadmap for not only getting people into housing but also ensuring that they have access to the support, services, and income that allow them to thrive,\" Biden wrote in an introductory letter to the plan. \"It is a plan that is grounded in the best evidence and aims to improve equity and strengthen collaboration at all levels.\"\n\nThere are a number of prongs to the agenda, a large part of which builds on the president's previously-signedAmerican Rescue Plan. That roadmap, which was passed in 2021 as a stimulus package to help jump-start the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, has already provided billions of dollars in rental assistance tohelp keep people off the streets. \"All In\"is aiming to increase this federal funding significantly in an effort to build more homeless shelters and affordable housing. The White House said more than 100,000 people will have already been removed from homelessness by the end of 2022.\n\n\"All In\" is built around three foundational principles — equity, data, and collaboration — and three solution principles — housing and support, homelessness response, and prevention. Each of these pillars \"includes strategies the federal government will pursue to facilitate increased availability of and access to housing, economic security, health care, and stability for all Americans.\"\n\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\n\nAsInsiderreports, the plan will also look to achieve a number of localized solutions to homelessness, including the mobilization of funds to create housing on state levels as well as federal levels. Further, it outlines a number of cross-country homelessness initiatives that will be supported by the White House.\n\nThe entire network of strategies will follow the \"Housing First\" model, the White House said. Per theNational Alliance to End Homelessness(NAEH), this idea is a public housing approach that focuses on getting homeless people a permanent place to stay prior to addressing any other systemic problems, such as drug addiction or mental illness. The idea is guided by the principle that basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter, should override any other problems a homeless person may be having.\n\nThe statistics on homelessness have been derailed due to the pandemic, so 2020 is the last full year in which data was collected. That year, there were just over 580,000 people experiencing homelessness in the United States, theNAEH reported. While the majority — 70 percent — were living on their own, the rest were families, many of which had young children. This included people from every race, background, gender, and ethnicity.\n\nIn total, more than 1.25 million people experienced homelessness at some point in 2020, and the crisishas been only exacerbatedby economic hardships and issues from the pandemic.\n\nOverall homelessness data collected from 2010 to 2016 showed that the total number of people living on the street was steadily declining; however, that figure has been rising every year since, according to the NAEH. AndThe Washington Postreports that, in addition to overall rising numbers, there are now more unsheltered homeless people — people who actually live on the street — than those who reside in homeless shelters.\n\nAgain, the goa..."}

It’s not clear what Mr. Trump is willing to give in return.\n\nTheir first meeting in Singapore produced vague promises from Mr. Kim to abandon his weapons programs, but there has been scant progress on that front since then despite months of follow-up talks between the two sides.\n\nThe U.S. “didn’t really get anything out of that Singapore summit, just an aspirational statement,” said Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst and chair of the Korea program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “You can argue that not much has really changed.”\n\nBruce Klingner, a specialist on Korea at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said recent North Korean public statements “indicate the two sides are no closer to even having a common definition of denuclearization, let alone a comprehensive detailed agreement.”\n\nBut former CIA officer Andrew Kim, who helped negotiate last year’s breakthrough meeting, said he expects more progress from the second summit.\n\n“The stars kind of have lined up,” he said in a speech Friday. “I have come to believe we have a great opportunity to engage with Pyongyang.”\n\nWhen the president sits down with Mr. Kim for two days of talks starting Wednesday in Hanoi, he will try to pin down the reclusive communist autocrat on his definition of “denuclearization.”\n\nTo U.S. officials, it means complete, verifiable and irreversible elimination of Pyongyang’s weapons programs. But a senior administration official acknowledged that one of the goals sought by the White House at the second summit is “developing a shared understanding of what denuclearization is.”\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that North Korea is still a nuclear threat, although “tensions are reduced.”\n\n“We’ve got work to do on the denuclearization,” Mr. Pompeo said. “There are many things [Mr. Kim] could do to demonstrate his commitment to denuclearization.”\n\nHe said Mr. Trump is focused on “a demonstrable, verifiable step” from North Korea.\n\nFormer Ambassador Joseph DeTrani, who served as special U.S. envoy to six-party talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said the most important objective is “clarity on the nuclear issue.”\n\n“I think at this summit, North Korea has to hear that again — that the U.S. is resolute,” Mr. DeTrani said. “And does North Korea agree with that? What is their definition of complete denuclearization? Describe it any way you want, but now you know clearly where we are. There’s no ambiguity on the U.S. side.”\n\nSpeaking of the need for clarity, security analysts say the White House has been sending mixed messages about its goals for the summit. Mr. Trump said last week he feels no urgency to make a deal with Mr. Kim, pointing out that sanctions are still in force and that North Korea hasn’t conducted a nuclear or missile test in well over a year.\n\n“I’m in no rush,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s no [weapons] testing. As long as there is no testing, I’m in no rush.”\n\nThe administration’s announcement that it is seeking a “shared understanding” of denuclearization with North Korea seems at odds with comments by U.S. special envoy Stephen Biegun last month.\n\nIn a speech, Mr. Biegun said North Korea has committed “to the dismantlement and destruction” of all its uranium- and plutonium-enrichment facilities. He said the pledge goes beyond the Yongbyon nuclear plant.\n\nLowering expectations even more, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that simply sitting down for a second summit is an achievement.\n\n“The fact [that the president] is able to do it again is in itself a big success,” she said.\n\nBut having broken the ice last year with the first-ever meeting between a U.S. president and North Korean leader, the world now expects more from the relationship.\n\nWithout mentioning the possible easing of sanctions, the White House is promising unspecified economic benefits if Mr. Kim is willing to commit to a more firm plan for denuclearization.\n\n“The president has made clear that should North Korea follow through on its commitment to complete denuclearization, we will work to ensure there are economic development options,” the White House said.\n\nRichard Johnson, senior director for fuel cycle and verification at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, said a freeze on producing enriched uranium and plutonium is “a starting point.”\n\n“This is not going to happen in a year, this is not going to happen in two years,” Mr. Johnson said. “The essential next step is a fissile mater..."}

Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, last week called third doses “premature.”\n\n“There is no compelling reason to get a third dose now,” he toldthe New York Times.\n\nThe independent group of experts on Friday also reviewed a Pfizer study of 306 people showing that virus-fighting antibodies jumped threefold after a booster shot was given around six to eight months after the second dose.\n\nBut Meg Seymour, of the National Center for Health Research, argued there wasn’t enough data for older adults.\n\n“The total safety sample is very small,” she said. “Twelve people over 65 is much too small to draw conclusions about safety.”\n\nAnother study out of Israel, which was also highlighted by the vaccine maker, tracked about 1 million people age 60 and older and found that a third jab was “roughly 95 percent” effective at protecting against the Delta variant.\n\nThe efficacy is comparable to the protection seen shortly after the vaccine’s rollout earlier in the year.\n\nStill, the panel was ultimately not convinced by those studies and others.\n\nThe FDA’s reviewers had suggested ahead of the vote that they preferred to focus on research involving Americans, insisting that domestic studies “most accurately represent vaccine effectiveness in the US population.”\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden and the country’s top health advisers insisted last month that booster shots would be needed — and likely available the week of Sept. 20.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, saidhe was “certain” that Americans would need a booster shoteight months after their second shot.\n\nBut not everyone in the scientific community agrees. The World Health Organization recently argued against boosters, saying that rich nations shouldn’t dole out a third dose when poor countries don’t have enough vaccines for their first.\n\n“It is unfortunate the While House announced the need for booster shots prior to the FDA’s assessment of the data,” Seymour admitted at the panel meeting Friday.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research within the FDA, acknowledged the divisive viewpoints during opening remarks to the advisory panel.\n\n“We know there may be differing opinions in interpreting the data,” he said. “We strongly encourage all the different viewpoints to be voiced and discussed regarding the data, which is complex and evolving.”\n\nAdvertisement"}

Russia is responsible.” The President’s offhand remark is unlikely to soothe Democratic fears of a possible Republican rout in November’s midterm elections.\n\nRelated articleBiden turns to countries he once sought to avoid to find help shutting off Russia's oil money\n\nAnd it offered Republicans another opening. The GOP finds itself in the enviable political position of demanding that Biden suffocate Russian energy exports, here and in Europe, while simultaneously hammering him for inevitable gas price hikes.\n\nThewar in Ukrainecreated yet another extreme challenge for Biden, who took office in the face of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and has seen his personal approval ratings plunge after failing to quickly conquer Covid-19 last year.\n\nThe gas price issue encapsulates a dilemma that can often afflict presidents at times of international crises. Biden is being compelled to take action in defense of critical global imperatives like the defense of international law, the plight of a people under vicious bombardment and a desire to deter a dangerous dictator. But he knows that his actions will have a detrimental impact back home. In the current polarized national environment and with only eight months to go before congressional elections, the downside for the President will only be magnified.\n\nUkraine dominated Tuesday’s domestic political exchanges in Washington amid a classic Capitol Hill squabble about the best way to advance a $14 billion aid package for the war-battered country this week.\n\nThe critical political potential of the gas price debate as the midterm elections approach shone through the defensive messaging of Biden and other Democrats on the issue and a united front of attacks by Republicans.\n\nThe President delivered a fireside chat-style address earlier Tuesday as he took aim at Russian energy exports, taking Americans into his confidence with straight talk about the likely impact of his actions on their daily lives.\n\nRelated articleWhat's stalling Congress' Ukraine aid and government funding bill\n\n“The decision today is not without cost here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,” Biden said, noting an increase of 75 cents per gallon for regular gasoline since the invasion started. He repeatedly laid the blame for “Putin’s price hike” on Russia, apparently seeking to insulate himself and other Democrats from the full force of Americans’ fury over rising prices.\n\nBut the President also appealed to something fundamental inside Americans – their reverence for freedom, empathy for the oppressed and a willingness to stand up to an autocratic Putin, even if they also have to pay a price.\n\n“I said I would level with the American people from the beginning. And when I first spoke to this, I said defending freedom is going to cost, it’s going to cost us as well, in the United States,” Biden said at the White House.\n\nThere is early evidence thatAmericans will accept some personal difficultyin order to defend the freedoms of far-off Europeans and to confront tyranny, although though they are hardly being asked for the sacrifices demanded of previous generations during the war-scarred 20th century.\n\nIn aCNN/SSRS polllate last month, 83% of Americans said they favored increased economic sanctions against Russia after the invasion.\n\nYet with the conflict expected to grind on for weeks, if not months, and with Ukrainians showing no signs of giving up their resistance, the sanctions on Russia that have caused oil prices to balloon are unlikely to be lifted soon. That means months more duress for American drivers. High gas prices are especially punishing for working Americans living paycheck to paycheck or for those who have to drive long distances to work or school. Those costs may be amplified as Americans look to visit family or go on vacation with much of the country finally emerging from the pandemic.\n\nSo Biden also used his speech to deliver a warning to another unpopular target: oil and gas corporations.\n\n“We understand Putin’s war against the people of Ukraine is causing prices to rise. We get that. That’s self-evident. But it’s no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to explo..."}

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - A hiring sign is displayed at a restaurant in Schaumburg, Ill., April 1, 2022. The white-hot demand for U.S. workers cooled a bit in April, though the number of unfilled jobs remains high and companies are still desperate to hire more people. Employers advertised 11.4 million jobs at the end of April, the Labor Department said Wednesday, June 1, 2022 down from nearly 11.9 million in March, the highest level on records that date back 20 years. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, file)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added 390,000 jobs in May, extending a streak of solid hiring that has bolstered an economy under pressure from high inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nLast month’s gain reflects a resilient job market that has so far shrugged off concerns that the economy will weaken in the coming months as the Federal Reserve steadily raises interest rates to fight inflation. The unemployment rate remained 3.6%, just above a half-century low,the Labor Department said Friday.\n\nThe job growth in May, though healthy, was the lowest monthly gain in a year. But it was high enough to keep the Fed on track to pursue what’s likely to be the fastest series of rate hikes in more than 30 years. Stock market indexes fell Friday after the government released the jobs report, reflecting that concern.\n\nBusinesses in many industries remain desperate to hire because their customers havekept spending freelydespite intensifying concerns about high inflation. Americans’ finances have been buoyed by rising pay and an unusually large pile of savings that were accumulated during the pandemic, particularly by higher-income households.\n\n“Given all the talk we’ve heard about recession and economic headwinds, it was very reassuring to see a solid jobs number,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo.\n\nOne encouraging sign, Vitner said, was that hiring was broad-based across most of the economy.\n\n“When the economy loses momentum,” he said, hiring tends to occur in just a few sectors, “and that’s not what we’re seeing today.”\n\nNearly every large industry added workers in May. One major exception was retail, which shed nearly 61,000 positions. Some large retailers, including Walmart and Target, have reported disappointing sales and earnings. Last month, Walmart said it had over-hired and then reduced its head count through attrition.\n\nConstruction companies added 36,000 jobs, a hopeful sign for Americans who have bought new homes that aren’t yet built because of labor and parts shortages. Shipping and warehousing companies, still struggling to keep up with growing online commerce, added 47,000 jobs. Restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues hired 84,000.\n\nLast month, Friday’s report showed, more Americans came off the sidelines of the workforce and found jobs, a sign that rising wages and plentiful opportunities are encouraging people to look for work. Still, the proportion of people who either have a job or are looking for one remains below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRising prices might also have led some to take jobs: The number of people ages 55 or over who are working rose last month, suggesting that some older Americans are “unretiring” after leaving their jobs — or being laid off — during the pandemic and its aftermath.\n\nAverage hourly wages rose 10 cents in May to $31.95, the government said, a solid gain but not enough to keep up with inflation. Compared with 12 months earlier, hourly pay climbed 5.2%, down from a 5.5% year-over-year gain in April and the second straight drop.\n\nStill, more moderate pay raises could ease inflationary pressures in the economy and help sustain growth.\n\nWorkers, in general, are enjoying nearly unprecedented bargaining power. The number of people who are quitting jobs, typically for better positions at higher pay, has been at or near a record high for six months. Layoffs are at their lowest level on records dating back 20 years.\n\nYet there are signs that some companies, facing rising costs for parts and labor, are starting to think twice about demands for higher pay.\n\nOne such executive is Jackie Bondanza, CEO of Hounds Town, a chain of doggie daycares with 30 locations in 14 states. Bondanza said people are applying for jobs at the company’s headquarters in Ronkonkoma, New York, who don’t necessarily have relevant experience yet are demanding high salaries.\n\n“People are coming in demanding 30% more,” she said. “We can’t afford to overpay for somebody.”\n\nEven so, Bondanza plans to keep hiring to support the company’s expansion. Hounds Town, which expects to open 50 new franchised outlets in the next 18 months, is seeking to fill three jobs, including a training director and a marketing director. The company now has 17 employees at its corporate office, up from five a year ago.\n\nInflation, she said, has yet to discourage most customers from seeking the company’s services, which inclu..."}

But we’re looking at swapping. We’re going to get some back,\" referring to Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia. \"We’re going to get some switched. They’ll be some swapping of territories.\"\n\nU.S. and Russian officials have been working towards an agreement on territories for a planned summit meeting between Trump and Putin. Bloomberg cited unnamed sources who indicated the U.S.is working to get buy-in from Ukraineand its European allies on the deal – which is far from certain, the sources told Bloomberg.\n\nA White House official said the Bloomberg story was speculation. A Kremlin spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDuring the Aug. 8 meeting at the White House with Azerbaijan and Armenian leaders, Trump told reporters he would be meeting with Putin \"very shortly\" and said he would soon announce the location.\n\n\"I'll be meeting very shortly with President Putin. It would have been sooner, but I guess there are security arrangements that unfortunately people have to make,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier, in an apparent response to the Bloomberg reporting, PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid \"the United States is determined to achieve a ceasefire, and we must jointly support all constructive steps.\"\n\n\"A dignified, reliable and lasting peace can only be the result of our joint efforts,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nPutin claims four Ukrainian regions – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014. His forces do not fully control all the territory in the four regions.\n\nUkraine has previously signalled a willingness to be flexible in the search for an end to a war that has ravaged its towns and cities and killed large numbers of its soldiers and citizens.\n\nBut accepting the loss of around a fifth of Ukraine's territory would be painful and politically challenging for Zelenskyy and his government, according to Tyson Barker, the U.S. State Department's former deputy special representative for Ukraine's economic recovery.\n\nBarker said the proposal, as outlined by Bloomberg, would be immediately rejected by the Ukrainians.\n\n\"The best the Ukrainians can do is remain firm in their objections and their conditions for a negotiated settlement, while demonstrating their gratitude for American support,\" said Barker, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council.\n\nSince his return to the White House in January, Trump has moved to mend relations with Russia and sought to end the war. In his public comments he has veered between admiration and sharp criticism of Putin.\n\nIn a sign of his growing frustration with Putin's refusal to halt Russia's military offensive, Trump has threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs from Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless the Russian leader agrees to end the 3-1/2 year conflict, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two.\n\nBut with the Putin-Trump summit expected in the coming days, it is unclear whether those sanctions will take effect or will be delayed or cancelled.\n\nThe administration took a step toward punishing Moscow's oil customers on August 6, imposing an additional 25% tariff on goods from India over its imports of Russian oil, marking the first financial penalty aimed at Russia in Trump's second term.\n\nTrump's special envoy Steve Witkoff held three hours of talks with Putin in Moscow on Wednesday that both sides described as constructive.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, a close ally of Ukraine, said earlier on August 8 that a pause in the conflict could be close. He was speaking after talks with Zelenskyy.\n\nTrumpbrokered a deal to end three decades of conflictbetween Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan on Aug. 8, and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed the agreement at the White House.\n\nContributing: Reuters."}

When the video of Tyre’s death was released Friday, it provoked disgust, shame, anger, heartbreak, embarrassment and a deep sadness.\n\nWith every kick, punch and blow to Tyre, these police officers should have remembered the names and experiences ofGeorge Floyd,Breonna Taylorand the countless other Black men and women who have died at the hands of police officers — but they didn’t.  With multiple cameras recording the beating on Castlegate Lane, one would think that a few officers would have discouraged the beating or attended to Tyre’s medical needs, but they didn’t.   You would think they would care about the impact of their actions, but they didn’t.\n\nAt the NAACP’s National Convention in 2022, Chairman Leon W. Russell, in one of his most inspiring speeches, delivered aclarion callto cease Black-on-Black assaults and killings.  There were no boundaries or parameters to this call to action, which meant that it extended to Black police officers as well.\n\nAccording to news reports, Tyre was not a weapon-wielding assailant who posed a threat to the officers or to others. When he was pursued by Memphis police, he was running to a safe place — in this case, his home, like any African American who is terrified of police officers would.\n\nOnce he was detained, Tyre’s 140-pound frame sustained a brutal beating which included body blows with batons, punches to the head and kicks in the abdomen. He was tased and pepper-sprayed. To add insult to injury, 10 officers stood around talking while Tyre’s beaten and handcuffed body was slumped against a police car. Their gross neglect in not providing medical care to this young man is nothing short of contemptible. The beating that Tyre took was inexpressibly inhumane, barbaric and ruthless. It was a gross depiction of collective callousness and remorseless conduct.\n\nWhat happened to Tyre Nichols is not about race. It is about the use of force and brutality by five police officers. Those who were supposed to be the protectors were the perpetrators.  But we need to remember that the five African American police officers seen in that horrific video don’t represent all Black people just as they don’t represent all police officers.\n\nThis is the time for Congress to come together and pass theGeorge Floyd Justice in Policing Act. It has been sitting in Congress for nearly two years. The objective of the act is to hold law enforcement accountable for misconduct, improve transparency through data collection, and reform police training and policies.\n\nTyre Nichols was weaponless and defenseless. The five officers were lawless. The death was senseless.  These officers must be held accountable for their actions in criminal and civil court. Americans must push for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act before there is another egregious assault on humanity.\n\nMay God bless the family of Tyre Nichols and use his death to heal our country.\n\nThe Rev.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.\n\nDemocratic Chairman Jerry Nadler presses Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on his supervision of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitakerstunned onlookers and lawmakers during an already-contentious House hearing Friday, when he tried to call time on the Democratic chairman after yet another line of questioning regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nThe retort came after Chairman JerroldNadler,D-N.Y., first said he wanted Whitaker to appear for a private deposition after the hearing and went on to ask Whitaker whether he had been “asked to approve any requests or action” for the special counsel.\n\nWHITAKER WILL TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE PANEL AFTER TENSE BACK-AND-FORTH: NADLER AND DOJ\n\n“Mr. Chairman, I see that your five minutes is up, so…” Whitaker replied as the hearing room broke out in gasps. “I am here voluntarily. We have agreed to five-minute rounds.”\n\nNadler, who even cracked a slight smile at the response, repeated his question, and Whitaker ultimately responded: “I have not interfered in any way with the special counsel’s investigation.”\n\nAs it dragged on, the hearing repeatedly gave way to bickering among Whitaker and Democratic lawmakers, and among members of the committee, over whether Whitaker was properly answering questions. At one point, he tussled with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, when she pressed on whether he’s appeared before for an oversight hearing.\n\nWhile the answer, eventually, was that he had not, the congresswoman objected when Whitaker would not answer with a requested “yes or no.” When she asked the chairman if her time had been restored, Whitaker snarked back: “I don’t know whether your time’s been restored or not.”\n\n“Mr. Attorney General, we’re not joking here, and your humor is not acceptable,” the congresswoman responded.\n\nThe fiery back and forth follows a dramatic political prelude to the hearing itself, complete with threats by Nadler to subpoena the witness and threats by the DOJ to boycott. Democrats are acutely focused on Whitaker's oversight of the Mueller probe, in his acting AG status while awaiting confirmation of President Trump's attorney general pick William Barr.\n\n“There has been no change in the overall management of the special counsel investigation,” Whitaker testified Friday, saying that he never offered any “promises or commitments” regarding the Mueller or any other investigation.\n\nNadler pressed Whitaker over whether he had shared information about the investigation with Trump, or any White House officials.\n\n“I do not intend today to talk about my private conversations, but to answer your question, I did not talk to the president about the status of the investigation,” Whitaker answered. “Consistent with what I’ve already said, I have not talked about the special counsel’s investigation with any White House officials.”\n\nWhitaker did not directly answer several of Nadler’s other questions, resulting in the chairman requesting that the acting attorney general return to the committee at a later date.\n\n“I’ve given you a fair opportunity so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don’t appear to have done any of that,” Nadler said, referring to Whitaker’s preparations, while saying, “I do not believe issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem.” Nadler explained that the committee would “attempt to reach an accommodation with the department to receive answers,” so Whitaker can return for “deposition before the committee, under oath.”\n\nNadler said that, at that point, he expects “clean answers or proper assertion of privilege claimed by the president.”\n\nMeanwhile, the top Republican on the committee blasted the hearing as a \"dog and pony show.\"\n\n“This hearing is a character assassination on Acting Attorney General Whitaker, all pure political theater, to go after the president,” Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga, said in his opening statement while urging the committee to adjourn.\n\nWHITAKER: MUELLER PROBE IS 'CLOSE TO BEING COMPLETED'\n\nA vote was then taken on whether to abruptly end the hearing. The measure did not pass, and the hearing began as scheduled.\n\nThe hearing follows an intense back and forth between the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee a day earlier.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to give Nadler the authority to issue a subpoena if necessary, despite Whitaker having already agreed to appear before the panel voluntarily.\n\nNadler made clear early Thursday that he did not want to have to subpoena Whitaker, but said a “series of troubling events” suggested it wo..."}

On Monday afternoonthe company said“this ad violates Facebook’s advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it. While the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook, it cannot receive paid distribution.”\n\nThe ad was released by the Trump campaign late last week. It vilified the thousands of migrants walking toward the US southern border, wrongly portraying them as invaders and criminals. It seemed designed to stoke fear ahead of the midterm elections and increase Republican turnout.\n\nCNN determined that the ad was racist and declined to sell airtime for it. But other networks agreed to sell the time.\n\nMany viewers were stunned when it aired during “Sunday Night Football,” which raked in 21 million viewers this week.\n\nThis week’s game had a particularly big audience as it featured a highly-anticipated matchup between two of the league’s premier quarterbacks, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.\n\nA spokesman for the NFL said the league played no role in the airing of Sunday’s ad.\n\n“The NFL has no approval rights regarding campaign ads,” the spokesman said. “That falls to the network that is selling the advertising and airing the game.”\n\nAlong with the NBC broadcast network, NBCUniversal allowed the ad to air multiple times on MSNBC before Monday’s decision was made.\n\nAn NBC source said the ad was cleared by the broadcast network’s standards and practices team. “We regret the decision that the ad ran at all,” the source said, “and it will not air on any NBCUniversal property, locally or nationally.”\n\nFox News did not explain why it pulled the ad. The 30-second spot was not only racist, it also contained factual inaccuracies, and it is not uncommon for networks to reject advertisements on such grounds.\n\nFox’s decision was particularly surprising given the network’s close proximity and friendly relationship with the White House.\n\nCritics of the network say its hosts and commentators employ some of the same racist rhetoric and scare tactics that were used in the ad.\n\n“How does Fox News square this with offering hours of the same racial fear-mongering in primetime to promote Trump (at no cost) on a nightly basis?” asked Jesse Lehrich, communications director for the progressive group Organizing for America and a former Hillary Clinton spokesman.\n\nOn Twitter, Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, ignored the decision by Fox to pull the ad.\n\nInstead, Parscale lambasted NBC, CNN, and Facebook and said the “#FakeNewsMedia” was “trying to control what you see and how you think.”\n\nA little while later, the president was asked about the controversy by a reporter. He said “I don’t know about it. I mean, you’re telling me something I don’t know about.” He added: “We have a lot of ads, and they certainly are effective based on the numbers we are seeing.”\n\nWhen asked about the offensive nature of the ad, Trump said, “Well, a lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of the times.”\n\nPeople familiar with the matter told CNN that the advertisement was not submitted to either CBS or ABC, so those networks didn’t have to decide whether to sell the airtime or not.\n\nCNN had to make the decision on Friday when the ad was submitted there.\n\nThe next day, Donald Trump Jr. complained on Twitter that CNN “refused to run” the advertisement.\n\nA CNN spokespersonresponded in a tweet, saying, “CNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist. When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined. Those are the facts.”\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Whilemost Americans believe global warming is occurringand think human activities are causing it, fewer than half think it will pose a serious threat to the planet in their lifetimes.\n\nSo what do those seeking drastic change do? They publish predictions of imminent catastrophe based on computer models, threatening doom and gloom unless dramatic measures are taken immediately. When that fails, they change the deadline and try again. And the shifting dates for climate Armageddon are just one reason the latest report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) may do harm to its cause than good.\n\nThe IPCC claims that if the world doesn’t undertake a massive effort to reduce carbon emissions by 2030, the result will be catastrophic — including mass wildfires, droughts, floods, food shortages, and dying coral reefs. The prescription offered to save the world by the 91 scientists who signed off on the report is a massive tax increase on carbon-dioxide emissions, as much as $27,000 per ton by the end of the century. That could cripple economies across the globe.\n\nThe trouble is, it’s hard to keep track of all the predictions we’ve heard in the last 20 years about impending catastrophes. Al Gore’s 2006 documentary filmAn Inconvenient Truth, which won him an Oscar as well as a Nobel Peace Prize, floated a wide array of assertions and predictions about warming that were either in error or exaggerations. Since then a number of environmental groups have talked about carbon emissions needing to be cut by 2012 (the World Wildlife Federation), 2016 (International Energy Agency), or 2018 (U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change).\n\nNow the IPCC tells us we have until 2030, but the longer period to take action is accompanied by heightened predictions of calamities. In the past, the IPCC said that bad things would happen if greenhouse gases were not curbed and global temperatures rose 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over what we estimate the temperature was in the 1850s, when large-scale industrial burning of coal began. Now they tell us that the world will be cooked if the increase is only 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn order to prevent that, the IPCC claims that by 2030 carbon emissions must be reduced 45 percent from the levels they were at 2010 and then reduced 100 percent — “net zero,” where any carbon emissions are canceled out by efforts to remove carbon from the air — by 2050. That means wind and solar energy must become the prime means of producing electricity and coal must effectively be eliminated. The price of gas for cars and electricity for home use will therefore rise dramatically.\n\nWhy aren’t Americans responding to this challenge?\n\nPart of the answer stems from a lack of trust in those making these predictions and demanding these sacrifices. Any skepticism about the most extreme global-warming predictions is considered “anti-science” or a form of “denial.” The climate-change movement is so resistant to the skepticism that is an inherent part of the scientific method that laymen sense they are being played.\n\nThere isn’t much debate about the fact that temperatures have gone up slightly in recent decades, and it’s not unreasonable to conclude that human activity has contributed to this trend. Moreover, to deny that the climate can change is to demonstrate ignorance of history. We know that the world warmed around the first millennium and then cooled considerably a few hundred years later, and then went into what historians call the “little ice age” in the mid 17th and early 18th centuries. Both those cooling periods are considered to be the result of diminished solar activity. While warming is now considered to be a deadly threat, the higher temperatures in the aftermath of those cool periods were associated with longer growing seasons for agriculture and a boon to humanity.\n\nEven if we assume that warming is accelerating to some extent and that carbon emissions are part of the reason, the notion that slight increases in temperature will set off catastrophes is based on computer models, not proven facts. Doubts about the veracity of their assumptions frustrate climate scientists and their publicists, but their furious resistance to even the most reasonable questions about their recommendations, such as those put forward by Danish skeptic Bjorn Lomborg, undermine trust in their thesis.\n\nThe effort to silence critics strikes those being asked to pay the bill for their conclusions as suspicious. The same applies to the hysteria attached to their predictions and the intellectually sloppy way they attem..."}

The area was mostly quiet, save for the occasional honking horn and the stereo sound of Bruce Springsteen's \"Dancing in the Dark.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, former cross-border truck driver Hank, who did not want to give his last name, said he was there to support his friends who've lost their jobs.\n\n\"We want our freedoms back, we want mandates lifted,\" he said. \"We want life to go back to the old normal not the new normal.\"\n\nWith a judge considering an injunction, and a state of emergency declared, most protesters are waiting to see if police make their move.\n\nHank says he thinks their time in Windsor is running out: \"We can't fight behind bars. We have to keep it peaceful,\" he said.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said the province's emergency order would apply to anyone impeding the movement of goods, people and services along international border crossings, airports, ports and major highways.\n\nThe Canadian province will also provide additional authority so that the personal and commercial licences of protesters who do not comply may be cancelled.\n\n\"Your right to make a political statement does not outweigh the right of hundreds of thousands of workers to earn their living,\" Mr Ford said.\n\nThe country-wide protests against Covid-19 vaccine mandates are poised to enter their third weekend.\n\nA \"Freedom Convoy\" was organised last month in response to the introduction of a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, or quarantine upon their return. The protest has since grown into a broader challenge to all Covid health restrictions.\n\nThe vast majority of Canadian truckers are vaccinated and trucking associations have distanced themselves from the protests, noting most drivers are still working.\n\nThousands of demonstrators have congregated in central Ottawa, others have blocked the Ambassador Bridge - which links Windsor, Ontario, with Detroit, Michigan - and a handful of other border crossings.\n\nAuthorities have warned members of the public to avoid Emerson, a small border town in Manitoba, where trucks and farm equipment are currently clogging the US border.\n\nThe trade disruption has been estimated to cost some C$380m ($300m; £221m) each day.\n\nSmaller protests have been held in Toronto and Quebec City, as well as near provincial legislatures in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia.\n\nThe mayors of Ontario's biggest cities issued a joint statement on Monday, condemning the \"irresponsible and damaging\" actions of the protesters, calling for all governments to bring the demonstrations to a peaceful end.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Canada's capital city filed an injunction with Ontario's Superior Court against people continuing to violate Ottawa's bylaws, aimed at those making noise, idling, fireworks, and encroachments on highways.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Superior Court justice delayed hearing an application for another injunction that would stop protesters blocking Canada-bound traffic at the Ambassador Bridge.\n\nUS officials have urged Canada's government to use its federal powers to end the blockade - especially of the Ambassador Bridge - which has already hit the automobile industry either side of the border.\n\nThe White House said this week that US officials had been engaged with their Canadian counterparts to help resume trade along the border.\n\nPremier Ford's Friday announcement marks the first state of emergency in the province since April, whe..."}

Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, and Albio Sires of New Jersey – last week said that they’ll retire at the end of next year rather than run in the2022 midterm electionsfor another term in Congress.\n\nTOP MODERATE BECOMES LATEST HOUSE DEMOCRAT TO ANNOUNCE RETIREMENT AFTER 2022\n\nThe latest news brought to 23 the number ofHouse Democratswho are retiring or bidding for another office rather than run for reelection in 2022, when their party tries to defend its razor-thin majority in the House amid historically unfavorable headwinds and a rough political climate.The GOPneeds a net gain of just five seats in the 435-member chamber next year to regain the House majority it lost to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms.\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., speaks during the Problem Solvers Caucus press conference in the Capitol on Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2020.

And the once-in-a-decade congressional redistricting process is expected to favor the GOP, as Republicans control more state legislatures and governors' offices.\n\nThis month's major setback forPresident Bidenand congressional Democrats in their push to pass a sweeping human infrastructure and climate change combating spending bill, along with the five-month downward spiral of the president’s poll numbers, are also doing House Democrats no favors as try to keep the majority next November.\n\nLONGTIME HOUSE DEMOCRAT DEFAZIO RETIRING AFTER 2022\n\nBut even before Biden’s approval ratings began to crater, House Republican leaderRep.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.\n\nFox News host reacts to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'\n\nGood news, we don't get that often. It's April 25 2022. Elon Musk bought Twitter today. That means that Twitter henceforth will be privately held. Elon Musk will determine what is allowed on the platform.\n\nNow, why is this significant? Not because it singles the sudden arrival of oligarchy as you're hearing now. It's too late for that; oligarchy is already here. Every major tech company is already controlled by billionaires. That's been the case for a long time, so this is nothing new. The reason today's sale of Twitter is big news, the reason it could turn out to be a pivot point in our history, is that Elon Musk does not agree with the rest of the billionaires in the tech business. Unlike the leaders of Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, Elon Musk believes in free speech. He thinks everyone should be allowed to talk, including people who disagree with him.\n\n\"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter,\" Musk wrote today on his new platform.\" because that is what free speech means.\" Now, that sounds like an entirely American sentiment, but in this atmosphere, that is a revolutionary posture. Of the five companies that control the flow of virtually all information that is consumed by the citizens of this country,Twitteris by far the smallest of the group, but it doesn't matter. One platform going rogue is enough to break the monopoly. That means you now have real options for expressing yourself.\n\nTWITTER APPROPRIATELY EXPLODES OVER NEWS OF ELON MUSK SALE: ‘GULP’\n\nElon Musk, founder and chief engineer of SpaceX speaks at the 2020 Satellite Conference and Exhibition March 9, 2020 in Washington, DC.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nGoing forward if you disagree with the administration's latest directive, you get to say so out loud to an audience. So, they're up there every day from the podium, the biggest megaphone in the world commanding you to hate this or that group, lecturing you about who's good and who's evil as if you're a child and have no right to decide for yourself these things, the basic things, but before today, you didn't have a right to express your disagreement in public. If you had an opposing opinion or even more dangerous than that, if you had countervailing facts that undermine their storyline, the tech companies would shut you down immediately. It happened to us. It happened to a lot of people, most of whom you've never heard of. Never hearing about those people was the whole point of shutting them down. But that's over.\n\nAfter today, you'll be able to post your dissent in a place where other people might have a reasonable chance of seeing it. In other words, you will have a chance to change other people's minds just like the White House does every day. So, you just became a little more powerful. The people already in charge just became a little less powerful. It's that simple, and it's that profound.\n\nOf course, it could change. It's possible that at some point Elon Musk will decide he doesn't really want dissenting views on Twitter. That could happen. Elon Musk can do whatever he wants, just as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg can do whatever they want and often do. This is the cost to the rest of us of living under a political system that is so dysfunctional it cannot even guarantee the core freedoms it promises its own citizens and free speech is the first on that list. Why? Because democracy depends upon free speech and the irony is, if you'd like to save democracy, you are forced to look outside the democratic system in order to do it.\n\nBIG TECH CENSORED BIDEN CRITICISM MORE THAN 600 TIMES OVER 2 YEARS: REPORT\n\nAt this point, you have no choice but to put your hopes in the good intentions of an eccentric billionaire. There's no other option because no one else is coming to the rescue. So, in the case of Elon Musk, we will see how this turns out, but for now, Musk's purchase of Twitter is the single biggest political development since Donald Trump's election in 2016. It is certainly the most threatening challenge to the corrupt and incompetent leadership of this country. Now, that may not be obvious to everyone yet, but the people in charge certainly understand it. The scene inside Twitter's San Francisco headquarters when the Musk deal was announced was akin to the scene when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election.\n\nIt is the collective grief of people who thought they were going to be fully in charge, who totally believed they'd be able to rule without limit. Those people learned that actually other people get to talk too and that realization is crus..."}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View moreopinionarticles on CNN.\n\nA human-rights catastrophe has taken shape on the border in Texas – and it has happened on the Biden administration’s watch. Monday, the nation saw horrifying images of Border Patrol officials appearing to chase and confront asylum seekers, who were largely Haitian, near the international bridge between Coahuila, Mexico, and Del Rio, Texas.\n\nThe video appears to show abusive treatment by agents on horseback trying to corral terrified migrants.As CNN reported:“In one video by Al Jazeera English that circulated widely on social media, an agent yells, ‘This is why your country’s sh*t, because you use your women for this!” at a group emerging from the river. His horse charges, attempting to cut off a family’s path to the camp, as a young girl in a green dress jumps out of the way.’”\n\nThe White House will be hard-pressed to explain or defend such treatment of human beings whose only offense was to seek refuge in America, as so many have done, after fleeing a country torn by political violence and natural disasters.\n\nJoe Biden’s administration is making things worse by refusing to process these asylum seekers, instead herding hundreds of them onto planes and back into harm’s way in Haiti.\n\nThere is no moral justification for this behavior. First, the facts. Haitians, like all people, have a legal right to seek asylum in the United States. Although asylum seekers may present themselves at an official port of entry,they are not requiredto do so.\n\nRelated video'Horrified': Mayorkas reacts to disturbing US border patrol video\n\nTheir presence in Del Rio is not only legal, it is perfectly understandable. As anyone who follows the news already knows, Haiti, our neighbor, is in extreme turmoil. The suffering nation has endured a presidential assassination and a major earthquake within just the past three months – this in addition to a devastating earthquake in 2010, as well as ongoing and grinding poverty, gang violence and political strife.\n\nMany in the Del Rio encampment left Haitimore than a decade ago, and had been livingincountries like Chile, Brazil and Panama.\n\nThe Biden administration itself recognized the unrest in Haiti when it issued a notice ofTemporary Protected Status for Haitiansliving in the United States, acknowledging that conditions in that country are too dangerous for many Haitians to safely return home.\n\nWhat should the United States do? It should honor the law on asylum and allow these migrants to exercisetheir rights.The United States has the tools to ensure an orderly and fair process to determine each asylum seeker’s case. We have done this before: From 1980 to 1990, the United States processed more than 100,000 Cubans seeking safety during theMariel boatlift.And this was done under a Republican administration.\n\nThe moral argument is even clearer. Haitians have gone through tremendous hardship, and are asking only for the opportunity to exercise their right to seek asylum. Groups likeHaitian Bridge Alliancestand ready to assist those seeking safety, as do dozens of religious and non-religious community partners.\n\nRelated videoHundreds of Haitian migrants pass through Mexico in bid to reach US\n\nAnti-immigrant extremists have politicized an issue that should be purely humanitarian. The former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller and his ilk made their political fortunes by dividing Americans and causing them to fear immigrants, especially Black immigrants.\n\nI should know: my organization, UndocuBlack, came into being just before Trump was elected President, and my colleagues and I watched how anti-Blackness and xenophobia permeated the conservative end of the political spectrum and poisoned the national dialogue in the last four years.\n\nWe had hoped the new administration would forcefully reject the politics of hate. But it has been cowed into adopting some of the policies that Biden’s predecessor used to keep people out.\n\nMaybe the appalling images of Border Patrol officers on horseback will arouse the same ire as those of children in cages during Trump’s presidency. But I fear that Biden will be given a pass, that he will get the benefit of the doubt because vulnerable communities still need so much from him.\n\nThe Biden administration could have made a strong statement in favor of due process and dignity by allowing for an orderly asylum process. Instead, it has opted for mass expulsions of vulnerable people.\n\nWhat the administration is allowing to happen to my Caribbean cousins echoes the racism Republicans wage openly. Last week, Lieut. Gov. Dan Patrick of TexaswarnedFox News audiences that non-White children were replacing White children. Patrick alsoblamed Black people for low vaccination rates, despite evidence that more White Texans remain unvaccinated than Bla..."}

To share not only grief and endless pain … I ask you to share with me the rage. The fury, anger, hatred for those who dare to kill our future.”\n\nNavalnaya, 47, accused the Russian authorities of murdering her husband, hiding his body and waiting for traces of the nerve agent novichok to disappear from it.\n\nHours after Navalnaya’s comments, Navalny’s spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, said Russian investigators told his family and his lawyers that they would not yet release his body.\n\n“Some kind of ‘chemical examination’ will be conducted with it for another 14 days,” Yarmysh said.\n\n“I shouldn’t have been in this place, I shouldn’t be recording this video. There should have been another person in my place. But that person was killed byVladimir Putin,” Navalnaya said, her voice occasionally trembling with emotion.\n\nShe said she knew “why exactly Putin killed Alexei three days ago”. “And we will tell you that soon,” she added.\n\nNavalnaya said that by “killing Alexei”, Putin had “killed half of me, half of my heart and my soul”.\n\n“But I still have the other half, and it tells me that I have no right to give up,” added Navalnaya, who last saw her husband two years ago.\n\nFor years, Navalnaya shunned publicity, rarely giving interviews to the media. Instead, she stood by her husband as he galvanised mass protests in Russia,flew him outof the country as helay in a comaafter a poisoning and defiantly returned to Moscow with him.\n\n“All these years I have been by Alexei’s side,” Navalnaya said on Monday. “But today I want to be by your side, because I know that you have lost as much as I have.”\n\nNavalnaya lives in an undisclosed location abroad and said her main aim was to protect her two children from the fallout of her late husband’s political work. She did not comment on whether she planned to return to Russia, where she would probably face persecution.\n\n“Putin killed the father of my children. Putin took away the most precious thing I had, the closest person to me, and the person I loved most in the world,” she said.\n\nNavalny’s last message to the outside world was a Valentine’s Day note to his wife: “I feel that you are with me every second.”\n\nMany inside and outside the country will now see Navalnaya as the natural heir of the Russian opposition, at a time when his death has stunned and demoralised Russian dissidents. Some posted on social media to voice their support for her.\n\n“Putin thought that by killing Navalny, he would forget his name,” Ivan Zhadnov, a close ally of the family, wrote on X. “But now Yulia will take his spot. Yulia who is free. Yulia who is fueled by noble and just fury. Putin made a grave mistake killing Alexey.”\n\nThe exiled opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov wrote: “Yulia, I wish you strength and patience! You can count on my support!.”\n\nNavalnaya’s dramatic video message was published hours before she addressed EU foreign ministers in Brussels, as Germany proposed a fresh round of sanctions over Navalny’s death.\n\n“Never forget Russia is not Putin and Putin is not Russia,” Navalnaya told them, clad in black and imploring the EU and the west to “do more to target Putin’s circle” and his oligarch allies.\n\nJosep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief who welcomed Navalnaya in Brussels, said the bloc’s foreign ministers “expressed the EU’s deepest condolences” to her. “Vladimir Putin and his regime will be held accountable for the death of Alexei Navalny,” he said.\n\nSanctions could include the use of frozen Russian assets, a move that would be in addition to a levyBelgiumexacts from interest on immobilised cash reserves.\n\nBorrell suggested that Russian prison officials linked to Navalny’s death could be added to the list of those subjected to asset freezes and travel bans in the bloc’s 13th package of sanctions against Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, which Hungary – yet to approve – on Monday said it would not veto.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Navalny’s aides said his mother and his lawyers hadnot been allowed into the morguein the Russian town of Salekhard near the prison colony where authorities said he had died.\n\n“One of the lawyers was literally pushed out,” Navalny’s spokesperson, Yarmysh, wrote on X, adding that morgue staff would not answer a question on the whereabouts of Navalny’s body.\n\nOver 63,000 people havesigneda petition to Russian investigators demanding the release of Navalny’s body, a campaign in..."}

The State Department said the object was equipped withantennas capable of collecting communications signalsand other intelligence-gathering equipment.\n\nBetween Feb. 10 and 12, the US shot down three more suspicious objects — one over Alaska on Friday, the second over northwestern Canada on Saturday and the third over Lake Huron on Sunday.\n\nNone of the objects have been tied to China or any other country.\n\nBiden has been largely quiet about the flying objects floating through US airspace, though National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the White House has been“as transparent as we can be”about the situation.\n\nWith Post wires\n\nStrictly necessary cookies are essential for the website to function correctly.

Most have cited his socialist plans and past statements, such as his refusal to condemn the “globalize the intifada” phrase associated with violence against Jewish people, as reasons for why he is unfit to be the city’s mayor.\n\nTrump does not have the power to arrest Mamdani outright, though he could order an investigation into him. Cities are not required to assist with federal immigration law, but actively obstructing it could earn Mamdani federal charges.\n\nMamdani previously said he would use his power as mayor to “stop masked ICE agents from deporting our neighbors.”\n\nThe 33-year-old has also promised to freeze rent, make buses and child care free, and create government-run grocery stores.\n\nHe shocked former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, beating him 56% to 44% in the final round of ranked choice voting. Cuomo was widely considered the front-runner before Mamdani declared victory following the first-round results last week.\n\nFollowing his victory, Trump quickly condemned him as a communist. More recently, he’s threatened to pull federal funding from New York City if Mamdani doesn’t “do the right thing” as mayor.\n\n“The people of New York are crazy,” Trump said. “If they go this route, I think they’re crazy. We will have a communist — for the first time, really, a pure, true communist. He wants to operate the grocery stores, the department stores. What about the people who are there? I think it’s crazy.”\n\nMamdani stirred up even more controversy lately by saying he doesn’t believe there should be any billionaires.\n\n“I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality,” Mamdanisaid in aMeet the Pressinterview.\n\nCuomo is considering running in the general election on an independent ballot line. A recent statement from his campaign, shared with theWashington Examiner, reacting to the final results of the primary, suggests they believe the general election is more representative of people in New York City.\n\n“Extremism, division, and empty promises are not the answer to this city’s problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,” Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said. “The financial instability of our families is the priority here, which is why actionable solutions, results, and outcomes matter so much.”“We’ll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps,” he added.\n\nREPUBLICANS TURN TO 2025 GOVERNOR BATTLES AS PARTY LOOKS TO RIDE 2024 SUCCESS\n\nMamdani said he was “humbled” by the over half a million New Yorkers who voted for him.\n\n“This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make New York City affordable. And we will do it together,” he said.\n\nNotifications"}

The statement said the Russian pilots sought to disrupt the US aircraft before the collision.\n\n“Several times before the collision, the Su-27s dumped fuel on and flew in front of the MQ-9 in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner,” the US statement said. “This incident demonstrates a lack of competence in addition to being unsafe and unprofessional.”\n\nOne of the Russian fighters then struck the drone’s propeller, “causing US forces to have to bring the MQ-9 down in international waters”.\n\nThe Pentagon spokesman, Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, said the Russian planes were in close proximity to the drone for about half an hour, and that the Su-27 which struck it was probably damaged.\n\n“It essentially ran into the MQ-9,” Ryder said. It is believed the Russian Su-27 landed at an airbase in occupied Crimea.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry denied there was any collision and suggested the drone was brought down through pilot mishandling.\n\nThe downing of the $32m drone triggered a race to recover the wreckage, as it contains some of the most advanced US technology and would be an intelligence windfall for Russia if it got to the aircraft first.\n\n“To my knowledge, at this point in time, the Russians have not recovered that aircraft,” Gen Ryder said on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe European Command statement warned: “These aggressive actions by Russian aircrew are dangerous and could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation.”\n\n“Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9,” Gen James Hecker, the US air force commander for Europe and Africa, said. “In fact, this unsafe and unprofessional act by the Russians nearly caused both aircraft to crash.”\n\nRussia’s defence ministry said in a statement that its fighters “did not use airborne weapons and did not come into contact” with the US drone.\n\nThe ministry said that fighters from its air defence forces were scrambled to identify the drone which the ministry claimed was heading “in direction of the state border of the Russian Federation”.\n\n“As a result of sharp manoeuvring around 9.30 (Moscow time), the MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle went into uncontrolled flight with a loss of altitude and collided with the water surface,” the ministry said, adding that its fighter jets returned safely to their base.\n\nIt is the first collision between Russian and Nato aircraft since Russia’s full-scale invasion just over a year ago, but it has highlighted the dangers of a clash leading to escalation through mistake or miscalculation as Russia and Nato forces field increasing amounts of military hardware around Ukraine – risks heightened by reckless behaviour.\n\n“This is my biggest worry, both there and in the Pacific, that an aggressive Russian or Chinese pilot or vessel captain gets too close, doesn’t realize where they are and causes a collision,” the head of the US Marine Corps, Gen David Berger, said.\n\nThe European Command statement said that the incident was part of a “pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots while interacting with US and allied aircraft over international airspace, including over the Black Sea”.\n\nIn the White House on Tuesday, the national security council spokesman, John Kirby, said: “It is not the first time certainly in recent weeks there’s been intercepts.”\n\nBut Kirby added: “It is the first time that an intercept resulted in the ‘splashing’ of one of our drones.”\n\nHe said that Joe Biden had been briefed on the incident, and the state department spokesman, Ned Price, said the US had summoned the Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov to “convey our strong objections”.\n\nHe stressed the US drone had been operating over international waters, and that the collision would not deter US forces from patrolling the Black Sea.\n\n“US will continue to operate in international airspace over international waters,” Kirby said. “The Black Sea belongs to no one.”\n\nLater, Antonov said Moscow views the incident as “a provocation” but said Moscow does not want confrontation with the US.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Japan, Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary, urged Moscow to respect international airspace.\n\nDara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation, said that the incident was just the latest in a long series of episodes over many years of what she called “coercive signalling” by Russian forces.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Russia Russian Forces Close Bakhmut", "output": "With Russian forces closing in, police try to persuade remaining citizens to get out and access routes come under fire\n\nRussia–Ukraine war: latest updates\n\nWar breeds euphemism and metaphor. In the battle for the Donbas city of Bakhmut, threatened with a closing encirclement by Russian forces after seven months of bitter fighting, there are “White Angels” and “Dark Angels”, the “road of life” (the Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway, which is anything but) and the “Invincibility Centre”.\n\nThe White Angels, a police evacuation group, scour the lethal districts of the shell-ruined city to evacuate children and the elderly.\n\nTheir counterparts, the Dark Angels, take out the dead. The Invincibility Centre is where the few thousands of civilians who remain can find water and hot food cooked by the volunteers who have stayed in the city, even as in the past fortnight it has faced an increasing threat of finally being overrun.\n\nIn a town to the west of the city, theObservermeets Oleksandra Havrylko, a 30-year-old police major who has recently spent time in Bakhmut and the surrounding villages with the White Angels, trying to persuade those caring for the last few dozen children to let them be evacuated.\n\nIt is a search that has led to rumours that police are taking children from parents who refuse to leave, which has prompted some families to hide their sons and daughters, inexplicable as that might seem.\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s true,” she says sadly. “There have been cases of people hiding children because they’ve heard rumours that the police will take their children by force.\n\n“But it’s not correct. The law says we can only take children with permission of the parents. If the children don’t have parents but have a guardian, we can get permission from social services to take them out.”\n\nInstead, she says, they are required to persuade families to leave. Last week that meant a visit to a village just outside Bakhmut.\n\n“We were looking for children. We had an address where we were told some children might be living. How we approach individuals depends on the situation.”\n\nSometimes, she explains, it requires several visits and a sense of building familiarity to persuade people to leave.\n\n“There was a family who said they didn’t have any money to leave or to rent somewhere. There was a seven-year-old child with them.\n\n“The grandfather wanted to evacuate but the mother didn’t. So, two weeks ago we found an apartment in advance and we photographed it to show them the pictures. And we said ‘look, this is where you’ll be going’.”\n\nShe shows pictures of the conditions that the civilians have been living in: damp, bare basements with flaking walls, many without any electricity, none with running water.\n\n“There are some cases where people equip their basements to make them more or less liveable. In one case, I saw a generator and children playing video games. But a lot of basements weren’t even designed to serve as bomb shelters.\n\n“They’re just filled up with stuff which people have brought down so they won’t get damaged: carpets, fridges, washing machines – even microwaves, none of which work. It looks a like dirty warehouse, wet. No electricity.”\n\nThe unremitting violence that has engulfed Bakhmut in recent weeks, after seven months of Russian efforts to capture the city, has only intensified in the last few days as Russian forces, including the Wagner mercenary group, have edged closer to encircling the city.\n\nViewed on a time lapse map, the areas held by Russian forces have pushed further west both north and south of the city, creating a pocket whose entrance they are now trying to shut off.\n\nAs both sides have poured more troops into the battle – the Russians in often-suicidal infantry assaults that have sought to swamp the defenders – and Ukrainian officials have spoken publicly about the possibility of withdrawal, thefighting has washed all around the city, threatening the last access routes.\n\nRoads out that were drivable only weeks ago are threatened by anti-tank missiles, artillery and phosphorous shells.\n\nOn Friday, Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, saidin a video that the Ukrainian city of Bakhmutwas “practically surrounded” by his forces and that Kyiv’s forces had only one road left out.\n\nPrigozhin, wearing a military uniform in the video, called on Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskiy to withdraw his forces from the small city.\n\n“Units of the private military company Wagner have practically surrounded Bakhmut. Only one road is left (open to Ukrainian forces). The pincers are getting tighter,” said Prigozhin.\n\nWhat the immediate future holds for Bakhmut’s defenders is more confusing – perhaps, deliberately so.\n\nAs a pair of key bridges – one across the Bakhmutka River and another along the Khromove-Bakhmut route just west of Bakhmut – were blown up by Ukrainian forces on Friday, many speculated it presaged a withdrawal.\n\nAmong them was the US Institute for the Study of War which said the mo..."}

Victory will be ours.”\n\nExperts say that might be true, but not anytime soon and not without a lot more death and destruction. One hundred days in andVladimir Putin’s warinUkraineis not going well. For anyone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat began as just another neo-imperial adventure,a “special operation’” to “denazify” Ukraineand restore Russian authority over its former Soviet neighbor, has spiraled out of all control. Millions have been forced from their homes; tens of thousands have been killed on the battlefield or by Russian bombardment; a great power has been humbled, and turned into a global pariah.\n\n“We just have to be prepared for the long haul,” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after meeting President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday. “Because what we see is that this war has now become a war of attrition.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen the invasion began on Feb. 24, Putin and his generals were convinced it would be over in days. Spy chiefs at the FSB assured them Ukrainians would welcome them with open arms. Russian commanders and paratroopers rushed into northern Ukraine, desperate to be the ones to “liberate” Kyiv from its “Nazi” government.\n\nBut under Zelensky’s leadership, the Ukrainians fought back, more bravely and more cleverly than anyone had expected—stopping the invaders in their tracks. Russia lost thousands of soldiers, from all ranks, before admitting defeat in the Battle for Kyiv and pulling its forces back.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwo months on from that turning point and the picture is transformed. Having concentrated its forces on securing control of the Eastern Donbas, Russia has been using its superior firepower to blast away resistance and grind out small wins and incremental advances across the battlefield.\n\nZelensky said this week that Russian forces now control about one-fifth of his country—an area almost equivalent to the state of New York. An even greater area is contaminated by landmines and unexploded ordnance. Twelve million people have been internally displaced, 5 million have fled the country as refugees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd where Ukraine once helped feed the world, sending 6 million tonnes of grain a month through its Black Sea ports, its vast grain reserves have either been captured and looted by invaders or are blocked because Russia now controls the seas it must pass through.\n\nIn in itsdaily intelligence update on Twitter, the U.K Defence Ministry did its best to encapsulate 100 days of war, beginning with the push towards Kyiv and Russia’s repeated failure to secure control of the key Hostomel airfield, northwest of Kyiv, with its airborne forces.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Following the failure of the initial plan, through false planning assumptions and poor tactical execution, Russia adapted its operational design to focus on the Donbas,” it said.\n\n“Russia is now achieving tactical success in the Donbas. Russian forces have generated and maintained momentum and currently appear to hold the initiative over Ukrainian opposition.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Whitehall analysts say Russia now controls over 90 percent of Luhansk Oblast, one of the two regions that comprise Donbas, and is likely to win complete control in the coming weeks. But that success has come at a significant cost and diverted men and equipment from other fronts on which Russia is now on the defensive.\n\n“Measured against Russia’s original plan, none of the strategic objectives have been achieved. In order for Russia to achieve any form of success will require continued huge investment of manpower and equipment, and is likely to take considerable further time.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTime may not be on Russia's side. Thelonger-range HIMARS missile systems promised this week by the United States, together with other advanced weaponry from the U.S. and other Western allies, could indeed be the “game-changer” the Ukrainians have been hoping for, allowing them to turn the tide in Donbas and start to recapture territory along the southern coastal corridor.\n\nThe 100-day landmark passed unmentioned in Russian media, after the Kremlin ordered its propagandist..."}

Joe Manchin effectively crushedPresident Joe Biden’s big domestic policy bill. But they face serious questions whether the $2 trillion initiative can be refashioned to win his crucial vote or the party will be saddled with a devastating defeat.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed on Monday that the chamber would vote early in the new year on Biden’s “Build Back Better Act” as it now stands, so every senator “has the opportunity to make their position known on the Senate floor, not just on television.” That was a biting reference toManchin’s sudden TV announcementagainst the bill on Sunday.\n\nBiden and Manchin spoke later Sunday, according to a person familiar with the call, first reported by Politico. It was cordial and respectful, said the person who spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut the conservative West Virginia Democrat and his party are so far apart, his relationships so bruisedafter months of failed talks, it’s unclear how they even get back to the negotiating table, let alone revive the sprawling more than 2,100-page social services and climate change bill.\n\n“We’re going to work like hell to get it done,” said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, repeating the phrase several times at a briefing but never saying how.\n\nThe setback throws Biden’s signature legislative effort into deep doubt at a critical time, closing out the end of the president’s first year and ahead of congressional midterm elections when the Democrats’ slim hold on Congress. is at risk.\n\nCoupled with solid Republican opposition,Manchin’s vote is vital in the 50-50 split Senateon this and other initiatives, including the Democrats’ priority voting rights legislation that Schumer also promised would come to an early vote.\n\nFrom the White House, Psaki struck a more conciliatory tone than her weekend hardball reaction to Manchin, saying Biden is a “longtime friend” of the senator and the president is focused on moving forward.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told CBS News “the stakes are too high” for this to be about “any specific individual.” She said, “This is about let’s get the job done.”\n\nSteeped in the politics of a state that Biden lost decisively to Donald Trump, Manchin has little to gain from aligning too closely with fellow Democrats, raising fresh questions over whether he still has a place in the party.\n\nIn a radio interview Monday, he reiterated his position that the social and environment bill has far too much government spending — on child care, health care and other programs — without enough restrictions on incomes or work requirements.\n\nBut the lifelong Democrat was less clear when asked if the party still has room for him — describing himself as “fiscally responsible and socially compassionate.”\n\nManchin said: “Now, if there’s no Democrats like that then they have to push me wherever they want.”\n\nAfter months of negotiations with the White House and Senate staff mem..."}

The House of Representatives' Jan. 6 committee made history with its unanimous vote urging the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against former President Donald Trump and his allies. Nearly 34 million Americans, including 9 million children,don’t have enough food to eat.\n\nThis week, for starters.\n\nI do this to myself every Christmas season. I have my reasons: My job as a columnist, which requires regularly tracking the news. My marriage to a U.S. senator, whose advocacy so often feels like a fight against the odds. My life as a lucky American who never has to worry about food and shelter,unlike so many residentswho live just a mile from our home in Cleveland.\n\nAs a practicing Christian, emphasis on practicing, I am called to acknowledge the suffering all around us and do what I can to help. How do I reconcile that with immersing myself in the material celebrations of Christmas?\n\nThere’s not a room in our house right now that isn’t decorated for Christmas, and that includes the first-floor bathroom, where a snowman sits on the back of the toilet in his Merry Christmas chair, circa 1991.\n\nI am conflicted, looking for permission to still feel joy.\n\nI found that recently in Robert Ellsberg’s introduction to a book of Dorothy Day’s selected writings. She was a pacifist and radical Catholic, having converted to the faith at age 30, and made a career of upsetting church and state with her relentless activism for the homeless and people in poverty. Every day, she witnessed human suffering and our collective indifference.\n\nAnd yet.\n\n“She knew what needed to be taken seriously,” Ellsberg writes. “But she was never too serious to forget what (John) Ruskin called ‘the duty of delight.’\n\n“In the face of the desperate suffering in the world,she felt we had a special obligation to attend to life’s joys and beauties: ‘We would be contributing to the misery of the world if we failed to rejoice in the sun, the moon, and the stars, in the rivers which surround this island on which we live, in the cool breezes of the bay.’ Frequently, in her column, she cited Dostoevsky’s words: ‘The world will be saved by beauty.’ ”\n\nSo, this is Christmas, too.\n\nEach morning, I look out the window next to my side of the bed and greet the mourning doves who cluster on our neighbors’ rooftop. They are waiting for me to fill the platform feeder in front of our porch. I appreciate their faith in me.\n\nLast weekend, our 8-year-old granddaughter called me on FaceTime to give me a tour of her favorite ornaments on their Christmas tree. She loves every last one of them, by the way.\n\nEach night, our 7-year-old grandson gets into bed and wraps his arms around his recently adopted dog. He rests his head against a headboard plastered with photos of his first love, the dog who died earlier this year. If he can embrace love in its layers of complexity, surely I can, too.\n\nMy list of beauty is long, and yours probably is, too, regardless of what or who you believe in. And isn’t that a wonderful thing to know about ourselves, regardless of the season.\n\nEarlier today, I set up the 12-piece nativity scene that, during my childhood, always sat on top of the TV. It is still in its original box, which Mom saved because of the printed declaration that it was “hand painted” and “hand crafted” – in Italy! She talked about Jesus so readily, so often. I have her faith, perhaps, but not her ease in expressing it.\n\nThis is one of my favorite bumper stickers: “When Jesus said, ‘Love your enemies,’ I think he probably meant don’t kill them.” It’s attached to the wall in my home office and not on my car’s bumper because mama didn’t raise a fool.\n\nThese words are the opening lyrics of a song by Linda K. Williams. Until this week I’d never searched for the song, but I found it quickly on YouTube and Amazon music. It’s a real toe-tapper of a tune that begins with an enthusiastic fiddler, and really is there any other kind?\n\nMy friend Pastor Kate Matthews gave me the bumper sticker nearly two decades ago, probably after my hundredth call to brainstorm how to reconcile my righteous anger as a progressive with my desire to follow the teachings of Christ.\n\nI’m not saying this bumper sticker absolves me of blame for my occasional outrage, but I do appreciate the reminder that no matter how upset I might get with some people, I never want to kill them. I just want to write about them and ignore their hate mail. (We all have our hobbies.)\n\nSo, this is Christmas.\n\nMay it land gently for you and you and you.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Connie Schultz is a Pulitzer Prize winner whose novel, “The Daughters of Erietown,” is a New York Times bestseller.

He also was charged with failing to disclose cash payments from the program on his income tax returns and concealing the existence of a Chinese bank account.\n\nThe verdict, returned after less than three hours of deliberations, marks a stunning fall for Mr. Lieber, who came under scrutiny by federal investigators over an academic partnership with the Wuhan University of Technology that dates back a decade. Prosecutors showed documentary evidence that Mr. Lieber had signed a Thousand Talents agreement with Wuhan that paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars — some in cash and some deposited into a Chinese bank account.\n\nIndeed, the Chinese Communist Party has worked tirelessly to acquire footholds in American higher education. For instance, government officialsmonitorChinese students’ behavior to ensure that they are not speaking negatively of their home nation’s regime. In one such incident, the family of Zhihao Kong — a student at Purdue University — was visited by government agents after Kong participated in an online rehearsal commemoration for the Tiananmen massacre.\n\nPurdue President Mitch Daniels later sent aletterto students, staff, and faculty explaining that administrators had learned about the incident.\n\n“We regret that we were unaware at the time of these events and had to learn of them from national sources,” Daniels wrote. “That reflects the atmosphere of intimidation that we have discovered surrounds this specific sort of speech.”\n\n“Any such intimidation is unacceptable and unwelcome on our campus. Purdue has punished less personal, direct and threatening conduct. Anyone taking exception to the speech in question had their own right to express their disagreement, but not to engage in the actions of harassment which occurred here,” Daniels continued. “If those students who issued the threats can be identified, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Likewise, any student found to have reported another student to any foreign entity for exercising their freedom of speech or belief will be subject to significant sanction.”\n\nBeyond higher education, American corporations — seeking to benefit from China’s large and quickly growing consumer economy — willingly capitulate to the communist regime.

(AP) — Search giant Google has agreed to a $391.5 million settlement with 40 states to resolve an investigation into how the company tracked users’ locations, state attorneys general announced Monday.\n\nThe states’ investigation was sparked by a2018 Associated Press story, which found that Google continued to track people’s location data even after they opted out of such tracking by disabling a feature the company called “location history.”\n\nThe attorneys general called the settlement a historic win for consumers, and the largest multistate settlement in U.S history dealing with privacy.\n\nIt comes at a time of mounting unease over privacy and surveillance by tech companies that has drawn growing outrage from politicians and scrutiny from regulators. The Supreme Court’s ruling in June ending the constitutional protections for abortionraised potential privacy concernsfor women seeking the procedure or related information online.\n\n“This $391.5 million settlement is a historic win for consumers in an era of increasing reliance on technology,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “Location data is among the most sensitive and valuable personal information Google collects, and there are so many reasons why a consumer may opt-out of tracking.”\n\nAt a news conference, Tong urged consumers to “do a little personal inventory” of their online settings and turn them off if they don’t want them.\n\n“It is not an exaggeration to say that we live in a surveillance economy,” he said. “Understand that you’re being tracked every minute of every day where you are.”\n\nGoogle, based in Mountain View, California, said it fixed the problems several years ago.\n\n“Consistent with improvements we’ve made in recent years, we have settled this investigation, which was based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago,” company spokesperson Jose Castaneda said.\n\nLocation tracking can help tech companies sell digital ads to marketers looking to connect with consumers within their vicinity. It’s another tool in a data-gathering toolkit that generates more than $200 billion in annual ad revenue for Google, accounting for most of the profits pouring into the coffers of its corporate parent, Alphabet — which has a market value of $1.2 trillion.\n\nIn its 2018 story, The AP reported that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store users’ location data even if they’ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so. Computer-science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP’s request.\n\nStoring such data carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects.\n\nThe AP reported that the privacy issue with location tracking affected some 2 billion users of devices that run Google’s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.\n\nThe attorneys general who investigated Google said a key part of the company’s digital advertising business is location data, which they called the most sensitive and valuable personal data the company collects. Even a small amount of location data can reveal a person’s identity and routines, they said.\n\nGoogle uses the location information to target consumers with ads by its customers, the state officials said.\n\nThe attorneys general said Google misled users about its location tracking practices since at least 2014, violating state consumer protection laws.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Google also agreed to make those practices more transparent to users. That includes showing them more information when they turn location account settings on and off and keeping a webpage that gives users information about the data Google collects.\n\nThe shadowy surveillance brought to light by The AP troubled even some Google engineers, who recognized the company might be confronting a huge legal headache after the story was published, according to internal documents that have subsequently surfaced in consumer-fraud lawsuits.\n\nTong, the Connecticut AG, thanked the AP for its story, which he said “set the table for the investigation by the states” and helped expose the tracking practices.\n\nHe said a new Connecticut consumer-privacy law set to take effect next year will require that people opt into any location tracking, and not have to turn it off.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed the first state action against Google in..."}

Ron DeSantisresponded Wednesday to a White House attack fromPresident Biden, who demanded he and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott \"help or get out of the way\" of administration efforts to mitigate the coronavirus.\n\nOn \"The Ingraham Angle\",DeSantissaid Biden is being disingenuous in blaming conservative governors who have refused to engage in widespread socioeconomic restrictions in regard to COVID mitigation, becausethe presidentcontinues to allow throngs of COVID-infected migrants to surge into Texas and in several cases be flown or bused to many states across the country – often without notifying local authorities in their final destinations.\n\nDeSantis told hostLaura Ingrahamthat some of the migrants crossing into Texas have explicitly expressed a desire to travel to Florida, which he said is unacceptable. He added that he like other governors are not being told whenillegal immigrantsare being transported, often on taxpayers' dime, to his state:\n\n\"They don't tell us. We try to do investigations. Sometimes we have gotten some documents and put 2 and 2 together. They do fly in… unaccompanied minors and a lot of military age males coming through the border,\" he said. \"You have law enforcement there helping Governor Abbott. They said of the illegal border crossers they come in contact with, a majority of them want to end up in Florida. We are working on strategies to be able to deter that.\"\n\nDeSantis said the issues in America under Biden transcend the pandemic, but intrinsically endanger national security.\n\nHe added that Biden is off base demanding Americans follow his edicts while he allows illegal immigrants to flood in from any country they want via Mexico.\n\n\"This is a guy that ran for president saying he would shut down the virus. He was not going to shut down America or the economy. He would shut down the virus. Yet what is he doing?

I’ve heard some suggestion in the commentary in recent days that Section 1507 may violate free-speech principles. It doesn’t.\n\nThe First Amendment has always permitted reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. The degree of permissible restrictiveness is heightened as the government’s interest becomes stronger.\n\nThe Constitution insulates the judiciary from politics, so it is obvious that the government has a high interest in protecting the integrity of the judicial process, on which the rule of law depends, by safeguarding judges, jurors, and litigation participants from intimidation and corrupt influence (e.g., pressure to decide a case based on fear rather than on faithful application of the law).\n\nMoreover, Section 1507 does not criminalize all expression; only expression undertaken “with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty.” The government must prove this intent requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. The First Amendment is not a defense against menacing. Furthermore, free expression forbids only the criminalization of protected speech, not proof of speech as evidence of a standard crime. (The First Amendment, for example, does not bar a prosecutor from proving that the mafia boss said “Whack him” to the button man shortly before the murder.)\n\nIt is notable that, in connection with the Capitol riot, the Justice Department has prosecuted scores of protesters on charges ofparadingon restricted federal territory. For analogous reasons, parading is one of the activities proscribed by Section 1507. In connection with January 6, the Biden Justice Department and the FBI wanted everyone to know it was scorching the earth to hold accountable everyone who could be identified as having violated the law, even if they themselves did not engage in forcible conduct against police or property. Under Attorney General Merrick Garland’s guidance, prosecutors turned a deaf ear to people who claimed “I was just peacefully protesting,” if the protesting was done under circumstances forbidden by law.\n\nAs I’ve also pointed out previously, acts that aim to intimidate and corruptly influence a judicial tribunal may be charged as obstruction of justice, underSection 1512(c)(2)of the penal code. This offense, because it also safeguards congressional proceedings, hasquite properlybeen charged against several of the January 6 defendants.\n\nIt could not be more blatant: Legally, the Justice Department has the same obligation to protect the Supreme Court as it does to protect the Congress. But politically, Capitol riot prosecutions of protesters promote the Biden-administration and Democratic Party line that Trump supporters are white-supremacist domestic terrorists; by contrast, prosecutions of protesters trying to intimidate Supreme Court justices would undermine the Biden-administration and Democratic Party line that the offense here is not the criminal leak and obstruction of the judicial process but the substance of a draft opinion that may not reflect the finalDobbsruling (but that would be entirely lawful if it does). Because politics, not law, drives the Biden Justice Department, the January 6 prosecutions are pursued but the unlawful interference with the judicial process is ignored.\n\nAs part of its reporting, Fox asked me to comment:\n\nAccording to senior fellow at the National Review Institute and Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy, the Biden DOJ is being silent on this for the same reason as the White House: “They are elevating their political interest in portraying the draft Supreme Court opinion as extreme over their constitutional duty to execute the laws faithfully and protect both the Court and the justices.”\n\n“I would note that months ago, when Attorney General Garland unjustifiably dispatched the FBI to investigate parents who were protesting the inclusion of racist and anti-American materials in school curricula, Garland claimed that the Justice Department had an interest in protecting teachers and school administrators. Not only was it untrue that schools were under siege; the relationship between parents and schools is a state and local issue, not a federal one — hypotheti..."}

That’s what we do. It’s not like they do it because these guys are model citizens. They’re doing it because they’re committing crimes or not following orders,” the officer said. “One or two of them might have been swept in there just because of wrong place, wrong time. But people were looting stores and causing mayhem at some of these protests.”\n\nJoseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and now a professor at John Jay College, said the courts have made it “almost impossible to deal with large-scale civil unrest” by allowing such lawsuits to proceed.\n\n“I think you’re going to see the cops take a step back instead of getting involved with this stuff, unless it’s their physical wellbeing or the person next to them is in danger. If not, you’re only going to be part of a lawsuit or whatever they’re going to do,” he said.\n\nThe city Law Department referred The Post to the NYPD when asked for comment on the settlement agreement.\n\n“Two-and-a-half years after the protests of 2020, much of the NYPD’s policies and training for policing large-scale demonstrations have been re-envisioned based on the findings of the department’s own, self-initiated analyses and on the recommendations from three outside agencies who carefully investigated that period,” the NYPD said in a statement.\n\n“The NYPD remains committed to continually improving its practices in every way possible,” the department added."}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday released its report on the deadlyCapitol rioton Jan. 6 and offered recommendations to help prevent a similar breach in the future.\n\nThe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Rules Committee announced the investigation two days after the riot broke out. The months-long investigation included two hearings and committees reviewed thousands of documents, a press release said. Members interviewed workers from the Capitol Police and various law enforcement agencies.\n\nRIOT COST TAXPAYERS AT LEAST $1.5M IN DAMAGE\n\nThe investigation seemed to be primarily focused on shortcomings pertaining to intelligence sharing, preparedness and the response time of reinforcements.\n\nThe issue has created a deep political fissure in Washington. Senate Republicans last week blocked the creation of a bipartisan panel to further investigate. The vote was 54-35, which was six votes shy of the 60 needed to take up the House bill.\n\nCAPITOL POLICE CONDUCT TRAINING EXERCISE\n\nThe reportreleased on Tuesdaywas compiled by Democrat Sens. Gary Peters, Amy Klobuchar and Republicans Rob Portman and Roy Blunt. The investigation found breakdowns at nearly every step of the way, from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security failing to raise the adequate alarm about the threat of violence to the lack of preparation by Capitol Police and other agencies.\n\nIt included new details about the police officers on the front lines who suffered chemical burns, brain injuries and broken bones and who told senators that they were left with no direction when command systems broke down, according to the Associated Press. The report recommended immediate changes to give the Capitol Police chief more authority, to provide better planning and equipment for law enforcement and to streamline intelligence gathering among federal agencies.\n\nThere were no functional incident commanders, and some senior officers were fighting instead of giving orders. \"USCP leadership never took control of the radio system to communicate orders to front-line officers,\" the investigation found.\n\n\"I was horrified that NO deputy chief or above was on the radio or helping us,\" one officer told the committee in an anonymous statement. \"For hours the screams on the radio were horrific(,) the sights were unimaginable and there was a complete loss of control. ... For hours NO Chief or above took command and control. Officers were begging and pleading for help for medical triage.\"\n\nThe report blamed an \"opaque\" process for delaying the request for National Guard assistance and pointed out that these troops were not activated or staged appropriately to respond to the emergency.\n\nThe committees recommended that the chief of the Capitol Police should have a direct line with the National Guard. The senators called for Capitol Police Intelligence Bureau to \"ensure the Bureau is adequately staffed and all agents and analysts are properly trained to receive and analyze intelligence information.\" It also called for new attention on social media posts to gauge threat levels.\n\nCapitol Police should conduct joint training exercises with federal, state and local governments in the future, the report said.\n\nThe committees said it is important for \"the mobilization of additional National Guard members from neighboring jurisdictions to provide immediate assistance and report to command and control in the event of an emergency.\"\n\nGOP EFFORT TO KILL CAPITOL RIOT PROBE COULD BE BEGINNING OF END FOR FILIBUSTER\n\nCapitol Police issued a statement saying it appreciates and welcomes the analysis conducted by the Senate committees.\n\n\"The USCP acknowledged it must improve how it collects and shares intelligence with its own officers and stakeholders and has made significant changes since the attack on January 6,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Neither the USCP, nor the FBI, U.S. Secret Service, Metropolitan Police or our other law enforcement partners knew thousands of rioters were planning to attack the U.S. Capitol. The known intelligence simply didn’t support that conclusion,\" the statement said.\n\nBlunt said the focus now should be on implementing the recommendations.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We owe it to the brave men and women who responded that day to do everything we can to prevent an attack like this from ever happening again, and in every instance ensure that the Capitol Police have the training and equipment that they need,\" he said.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nChad Pergram current..."}

Wade and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Sen. Cory Booker released documents pertaining to Kavanaugh's record that had deemed \"confidential.\"\n\nReporting by Emily Tillett, Grace Segers, Ed O'Keefe, Kathryn Watson and Caroline Linton\n\nThe hearing headed into a closed session around 10:15 p.m., almost 13 hours after it started. They will recovene Friday for the fourth day of hearings.\n\n\"I hope a lot of people in this country have formed very positive views of you, as I have,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said as he adjourned the hearing.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal floowed up on Sen. Kamala Harris' questions from Wednesday about if Kavanaugh had spoken to anyone at a the law firm of Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, Kavanaugh said he has learned his friend, Ed McNally, worked at Kasowitz's firm.\n\n\"I know Ed McNally used to work at the White House counsel's officeand I now -- I understand that he works at that law firm,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nKavanaugh said he never discussed the Mueller probe with McNally and he is not acquainted with Kasowitz.\n\nThe committee took a five minute break at approximately 7:39 p.m.\n\nDemocrats are questioning Kavanaugh for a third round of questions after the break. They are each allotted eight minutes.\n\nThe committee will then go into closed session.\n\nWhen asked by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Kavanaugh declined to say whether he believed that Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage, was correctly decided, employing the precedent of judicial nominee commenting on recent cases.\n\nHe also did not comment on family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, or about the right of the president or Congress to exclude immigrants from entering the country based on race.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis thanked all of the police present at the hearing who are required to work 16-hour shifts. The nod warranted bipartisan applause.\n\nTillis asked Kavanaugh why he hopes to become the next Supreme Court Justice.\n\n\"Public service as a judge is a great honor and it's a great responsibility,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nSen. Booker asked Kavanaugh if character matters for president of the United States and asked him if he respects President Trump.\n\nThe senator from New Jersey pointed out that of the original two lists of potential Supreme Court nominees Mr. Trump put out, Kavanaugh was on neither.\n\nAt 6:17 p.m., the hearing returned from a 30-minute recess and Sen. Cory Booker began questioning Kavanaugh.\n\nAt 5:48 p.m., the hearing went into a 30-minute recess.\n\nKavanaugh -- after facing a slew of political questions that he declined to answer throughout the hearing proceedings -- said he doesn't vote.\n\n\"I do not vote in political elections,\" Kavanaugh told the senators.\n\nKavanaugh, taking questions from Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, clarified that he doesn't believe the president has unlimited powers in war and in matters of national security.\n\nKavanaugh's stance on executive power has come into question, particularly since he worked in the George W. Bush White House on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, adding that \"civil liberties are not silent,\" even in war.\n\n\"The law applies even in war time and national security,\" he said.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, pressed Kavanaugh as to whether he has ever discussed the special counsel's investigation with anyone in the White House.\n\nKavanaugh suggested he had not had any substantive -- or certainly any inappropriate -- conversations about the special counsel's probe with anyone in the White House. But he didn't seem to be able to say he had never discussed the matter -- he said he has discussed questions about the special that might come up in preparation for his testimony.\n\nWhite House counsel Don McGahn has been helping Kavanaugh prepare for the hearings.\n\nBlumenthal eventually moved on, unsatisfied with the nominee's answers.\n\n\"There have to be some limits to executive power,\" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said.\n\nFlake noted the \"genius\" of the United States' system of government is there are constraints -- and checks and balances -- on presidential power.\n\nStill, the president has immense powers -- largely because Congress has given up too much, he said. Flake pressed Kavanaugh as to whether he uses Sept. 11, 2001, to justify the need for more authority.\n\nKavanaugh's much-discussed basketball teams he has coached showed up to his confirmation hearing in the afternoon, taking seats in the front row.

Mike DeWine, will lower the required training hours for armed school personnel from about 700 hours to four scenario-based training hours, plus a maximum of 20 hours for first-aid training, history of school shootings and reunification education.\n\nThe signing came the same day Ohio'snew constitutional carry lawtook effect.\n\n\"In life we make choices, and we don't always know what the outcome is going to be,\" DeWine said at a news conference. \"What this Legislature has done, I've done by signing it, is giving schools an option based on their particular circumstances to make the best decision they can make with the best information they have. That's all any decision-maker can do.\"\n\nOhio school districts are not required to allow staff to carry firearms under the law. House Bill 99 allows local boards of education to decide whether they want staff to carry firearms at all and how much training will be required.\n\nDeWine said he directed the Ohio School Safety Center to require at least 24 hours of training and eight hours of requalification training each year. The move appeared aimed at eliminatingconfusion among lawmakersover whether the bill established a minimum number of training hours.\n\nPrivate businesses that want to train school staff must also meet the 24-hour minimum to have their curriculum approved, DeWine said.\n\nDemocrats and gun control advocates panned the new law, saying it won't do enough to prevent gun violence and mass shootings. Law enforcement officials have also said 24 hours is not enough time to learn how to safely use a firearm.\n\nOpponents argued DeWine walked back on promises to address gun violence after a gunman killed nine people in Dayton in 2019.The governor respondedto cries of \"do something\" by unveiling a package of gun control reforms, but they never went anywhere in the GOP-controlled Legislature.\n\n\"I feel like a putz for believing him,\" Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said. \"He did something, alright. He gave in like a coward, and he made the problem worse.\"\n\nDeWine has signed three bills loosening gun restrictions since the shooting.\n\n\"It’s a complete bastardization of what people said in Dayton, frankly,\" said former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, who is running for governor against DeWine. \"This is not what the people of Dayton had in mind when they started chanting that.\"\n\nDuring Monday's news conference, DeWine urged lawmakers to consider provisions of the 2019 legislation that would increase penalties for straw purchases and prevent people with severe mental health conditions from possessing a firearm.\n\nDeWine's signature puts an end to years of debate over how many hours of firearm training Ohio teachers should have.\n\nParents in the Madison Local Schools district in southwest Ohio sued the district over its armed teacher program, arguing that the training required – about 24 hours –violated state law. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled for the parents in 2021.\n\nThe court ruled in a 4-3 decision that Ohio Revised Code required anyone authorized to carry a gun on school grounds to have 20 years of experience or peace officer training. DeWine argued the ruling made firearm training unmanageable for school districts that wanted to permit it.\n\nBut some law enforcement disagreed.\n\n\"I think it’s a horrible idea to arm our teachers,\" Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said. \"There’s a lot of training that’s involved in that. It's naïve to believe that is something we can put on them and expect them to respond to from a law enforcement perspective.\"\n\nThe governor used Monday's news conference to highlightother school safety initiativesthat he's rolled out since the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.The new capital budgetincludes $100 million in grants that schools can use to upgrade building security. The state is also investing in training to help school staff identify behavioral health problems in students.\n\n\"We are trying to do and have been trying to do every single day things that people keep safer – keep kids in school safer but also these same children who go home to neighborhoods where there's violent crime and repeat violent offenders,\" DeWine said. \"Their lives are important, too.

A widely cited epidemiological paper by researchers at Imperial College London predicted that such measures as bans on travel and shelter-in-place mandates would reduce mortality from the virus by 98%. But now, a new analysis by three prominent economists that surveys all empirical data from the academic literature measuring the relationship between death and lockdowns finds that forced restrictions didn’t work. Their conclusion: Lockdowns reduced mortalities by a minuscule 0.2%. That figure––and it’s so small as to be statistically questionable––simply wasn’t worth the costs, in their view. As the report states, “This meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns had little or no health effects, [but] they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted. In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.”\n\nTwo authors of thestudyare Scandinavian. Jonas Herby is special adviser at the Center for Political Studies in Copenhagen. Lars Jonung is a former economic adviser for the EU who for over a decade headed Sweden’s Fiscal Policy Council, the agency that assesses the results of the nation’s economic policies. The third is Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. Hanke served on President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers, and has long been one of the world’s leading counselors to developing nations on monetary policy,having helped pioneer dollarization in Ecuador and El Salvadorand held cabinet-level positions in Lithuania and Montenegro. The coauthors are clearly free marketers. But their academic standing, the vast quantities of data they analyzed, and their sophisticated methodology make a strong case for their conclusions.\n\nThe study defines lockdowns as “compulsory non-pharmaceutical interventions,” or what’s commonly known as NPIs. They include restrictions on travel, school closures, bans on international travel, restrictions on movement within a country’s borders, and mask mandates. The list excludes voluntary measures such as social distancing, as well as government-sponsored testing and vaccination campaigns. The authors didn’t collect their own data. Instead, they examined all of the academic literature on the topic, and distilled the findings of the most convincing papers. That process provided the most comprehensive view to date of the true effectiveness of lockdowns. They concentrate on the early days of the pandemic, spanning March to June of 2020, when the restrictions were most severe. The authors note that lockdowns were virtually universal. Of the 186 nations followed by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, all but one––the Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros––imposed at least one NPI by the end of March 2020.\n\nThe authors examined almost 19,000 studies to find the ones with the best data and measurement periods. They also chose those that provided the same metric––reduction in mortality rate per 1 million population––that enabled them to put the results side by side and reach an overall estimate of the lockdowns’ impact. In the end, they filtered the immense list to 24 studies of the pandemic’s first few months for their “meta-analysis.” Their choices divide into three categories. The first are “stringency index studies” that measure how the severity of the lockdown regime influences mortality rates. The second is “shelter-in-place order” or SIPO restrictions, and the third encompasses studies of individual measures such as shuttering schools or closures of businesses ranging from corporate offices to bars.\n\nSeven studies qualified for the the “stringency index” analysis. Only one found a substantial effect from lockdowns. On average, the authors found, the compulsory restrictions lowered mortality by that 0.2%. From the start of March to May 20, 164,500 people in Europe suffering from COVID died; the figure in the U.S. was 97,100. A reduction of 0.2% in the mortality rate, if the number is correct, would have saved 329 lives in Europe, and 194 in the U.S. For shelter-in-place mandates, the study found no “noticeable impact on COVID-19 mortality.” On individual restrictions, the authors saw “some evidence” that business closures reduced mortality, primarily from shutting down bars. But they found “no evidence that [other] lockdowns, school closures, border closures, and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect.”\n\nThe conclusions raise difficult societal issues. Although the lockdowns appear to have had little impact, they may have saved a small number of lives in the study period when the virus first raged. But the U.S. paid a huge price in lost jobs, businesses that neve..."}

These dictates are essentially strongly-worded suggestions. But you're forgiven if you think Psaki's summary of the report sounded like a command.\n\n\"Facebook needs to move more quickly to remove harmful, violative posts,\" she said. \"Posts that would be within their policy for removal often remain up for days, and that's too long. The information spreads too quickly.\"\n\nPsaki was alluding to anti-vaccine content, though the report itself impugns \"medical misinformation\" more broadly. Of course, the government itself hasspread plentyof \"medical misinformation,\" from the early bad guidance on masks to White House coronavirus czar Anthony Fauci'sdeliberate misstatementsabout the herd immunity threshold. For months, government health officials treated the lab leak theory of COVID-19's origins as a wild conspiracy theory, and Facebook followed suit: It vigorously censored content that promoted the lab leak theory. That policy was not revised until June.\n\nEfforts by the government and tech platforms to suppress misinformation have undeniably resulted sometimes in the suppression of information that is either factual, or could plausibly turn out to be factual. (This has been the caseoutside the realmof pandemic-related content as well.) New initiatives undertaken by the federal government that would encourage Facebook to be even more heavy-handed with potential misinformation should be met with skepticism: The track record is just not very encouraging.\n\nThe White House's targeting of Facebook should make critics a little sympathetic to Mark Zuckerberg's position. Prominent legislators from both political parties—as well as thecurrentandformerpresidents—want to aggressively regulate his company if not break it apart entirely. Facebook's CEO must feel tremendous pressure to give federal health bureacrats exactly what they're asking for, or else.\n\nInstead of defending the rights of private companies to set their own moderation policies independent of whatever the government would like them to do, Republicans are taking this opportunity to further erode Facebook's autonomy. Sen. Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) even suggested that the site's submission to the feds renders it an agent of the state.\n\n\"The social media platforms are increasingly just arms of the federal government and the Biden White House,\" Hawleytweeted. \"Why should the#BigTechcompanies continue to be treated as private companies when they function as agencies of the federal government.\"\n\nHawley is essentially saying that a private company complying with the government becomes a state actor, and thus should be bound to the same restrictions as any other public agency. (Former President Donald Trump'sdoomed social media lawsuitsrest on a version of this argument.) But Hawley and others arealsoattempting to punish these same private companies fornotdoing what the White House wants. (In Hawley's case, he wants Facebook to suppress fewer posts.)

These are achievements that even his conservative doubters and critics — including NR — can acknowledge and applaud.\n\nThat said, the Trump administration was chaotic even on its best days because of his erratic nature and lack of seriousness. He often acted as if he were a commentator on his own presidency, and issued orders on Twitter and in other off-the-cuff statements that were ignored. He repeatedly had to be talked out of disastrous ideas by his advisers and Republican elected officials. He turned on cabinet officials and aides on a dime. Trump had a limited understanding of our constitutional system, and at the end of the day, little respect for it. His inability to approximate the conduct that the public expects of a president undermined him from beginning to end.\n\nThe latter factor played an outsized role in his narrow defeat to a feeble Joe Biden in 2020 in what was a winnable race. Of course, unable to cope with the humiliation of the loss, he pursued a shameful attempt to overturn the result of the election. He didn’t come close to succeeding, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. The episode ended with Trump, in a grotesque abuse of his powers, trying to bully Vice President Pence into unilaterally delaying or changing the count of electoral voteson January 6and with an inflamed pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol while the president gave no indication that he particularly minded.\n\nIn the midst of this, he threw away two Georgia Senate seats in a fit of pique over Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger refusing to bend to his will. The resulting loss of Senate control allowed Biden to get trillions of dollars in spending that he wouldn’t have gotten otherwise and confirm large numbers of progressive judges.\n\nSince then, Trump has maintained his grip on the party and done all he can to force it to accept his delusions and lies about the 2020 election — boosting conspiracy theorists and fanatics and targeting for defeat, with considerable success, anyone pushing back too hard against him or his obsessions.\n\nTrump’s success in imposing his fixations and candidate choices on the GOP played a large role in the GOP debacle in the midterms. This political backdrop raises the possibility that his low-energy announcement speech may be a damp squib.\n\nCertainly, GOP voters should give up on the idea that Trump is a winner. After securing the GOP nomination with plurality support in 2016, Trump didn’t exceed 47 percent in either of his campaigns, winning in 2016 with 46.1 percent and losing in 2020 with 46.8. This is, to say the least, a very narrow electoral path, and one must assume that with all that’s transpired since 2020, Trump is weaker than in his first two races.\n\nThe party’s position has significantly eroded under his hegemony. When Trump announced his first campaign in 2015, Republicans were coming off a historic wave election, which brought them to 54 Senate seats, and 247 House seats. Republicans then lost the House in 2018, lost the Senate in 2020, and blew a chance for large gains this year. Now, they are looking at 49 or 50 Senate seats, and a razor-thin margin of control of the House of Representatives. On top of this, Republicans had 31 governorships; they now have 25, and have lost crucial ground in state legislatures, too.\n\nA lesson of the midterms was that association with Trump and “stop the steal” were liabilities, and no one is more associated with both of those things than Donald Trump himself. Democrats helped choose MAGA candidates that were eminently defeatable in GOP primaries this year, and nominating Trump — whom Democrats are pining to run against again — in 2024 would replicate this experience on a much larger scale.\n\nNeedless to say, Trump is a magnetic political figure who has managed to bond countless millions of Republicans to him. Many GOP voters appreciate his combativeness and hate his enemies, who so often engaged in excesses in pursuit of him. Once he won the nomination in 2016..."}

The international community has made great strides in educating the world about it.\n\nJust last week, the United Nations adopted aresolutionby consensus against Holocaust denial, while EgyptcommemoratedInternational Holocaust Remembrance Day for the very first time, in an event sponsored by Cairo’s US embassy and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Yet as we mark this year’s International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I am terribly saddened by efforts to minimize the atrocities and manipulate the memory of the Holocaust for political gain here at home.\n\nSeventy-seven years after the end of the Second World War, we have witnessed a disturbing surge in the politicization of Holocaust imagery that has distorted and warped its memory in disgraceful ways, often tied to debates about the Covid-19 pandemic or Israeli policy. The incidents are an affront to the memory of Holocaust victims and to all who espouse to support human rights.\n\nIn May, a group calling itself “Goy Power” showed up at apro-Israel rallyin a van carrying the message “Hitler was Right.” In November, attendees wore yellow stars to ahearingof the Kansas state legislature to discuss Covid-19 policies in the workplace.\n\nThis was followed by a host on Fox News going so far as to compareDr. Anthony Fauciwith Josef Mengele, the sadistic SS “physician” known as the “angel of death.” In 2019, New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezcompared border facilitiesto “concentration camps,” and earlier this month, Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson compared theCovid-19 vaccination policiesin Washington, DC, to the Nazi regime on Twitter. He laterapologized.\n\nThese outrageous comparisons, which were made to score cheap political points, are irrational, irresponsible, callous and hurtful. They deserve swift condemnation from all our elected officials from both political parties.\n\nRelated articleJamie Oliver is veering into cultural appropriation. Because he's Jamie Oliver\n\nUsing outlandish, irresponsible words and images to inflame people and for political gain is horrible; it inflicts yet more pain on the survivors who have already suffered so much. It is a sign of our divided times, in which we too often fail to see the humanity in each other.\n\nThat trend of dehumanization is worrying in and of itself. The Holocaustdidn’t happen overnight. It happened incrementally, with a numbing indifference that ballooned into a catastrophic event. The use of dehumanizing, antisemitic and racist language in Nazi Germany, that eventually spread across Europe, led to actions that saw the near extermination of the Jewish people.\n\nUse of such language today emboldens extremists and bigots who seek to weaken our societal bonds, a condition that is dangerous not only for Jewish people, but every minority group and, indeed, society itself.\n\nThese sorts of comparisons to Nazi Germany are an egregious affront to Holocaust survivors. The images and rhetoric are re-traumatizing for some survivors and they represent a clear example of what happens when we do not heed the lessons that survivors have painstakingly taught us. Holocaust survivors have worked to create a brighter future for all people; my parents instilled in me the values of resilience, hard work, philanthropy and love for Israel.\n\nI am proud that my organization, theJewish Federations of North America, which represents more than 300 Jewish communities across the country, is at the forefront of fighting back against this racist bigotry. We work to ensure that the next generation learns about the atrocities of the Holocaust, to understand what conditions allowed it to take place and to cherish both the memories of those we lost and those who survived.\n\nWorking with dozens of social service agencies across the continent and internationally, Federations also care for vulnerable Holocaust survivors, many of whom cannot afford food, dental care and other necessities. Even in the US, more thanone-third of Holocaust survivors live in poverty, according to The Blue Card, a nonprofit organization. This year we willallocate more than $5 millionto help them and other older adults whose lives have been impacted by trauma.\n\nRelated articleOne word sums up Breyer's judicial philosophy\n\nBeyond supporting survivors directly, one of the most important steps we can take to fight the rising tide of irresponsible, hurtful and hateful rhetoric is bolstering Holocaust education.

The U.S. Treasury sanctioned four Ukrainian officials it accused of working with Russian intelligence, including to form a new government backed by Russian occupying forces. The State Department blasted a Russian disinformation campaign it said was part of its \"pretext\" to invade Ukraine and \"divide the international reaction to its actions.\"\n\nOne day before his sit-down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to push back on Russia's narrative and make clear just how high the stakes are in the standoff.\n\n\"It's bigger than a conflict between two countries. It's bigger than Russia and NATO. It's a crisis with global consequences, and it requires global attention and action,\" the top U.S. diplomat said in Berlin, hours after meeting his German, French, and British counterparts to coordinate a response.\n\nThat coordination has had tremendous doubt cast on it after President Joe Biden said Wednesday that the NATO alliance was not united about how to respond to aggression from Russia that fell short of an all-out attack on Ukraine -- an uncomfortable truth that U.S. and NATO officials have tried to paper over for weeks.\n\nAfter the White House scrambled to clean that up, Biden himself clarified on Thursday, \"If any -- any -- assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. But -- and it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies.\"\n\nBut the challenge remains of what the U.S. and its allies will do if Russia attacks Ukraine with the same gray-zone tactics it has used for the last eight years, as it annexed Crimea, launched a war in eastern Ukraine, and began a slow-motion annexation of those provinces.\n\nThat war, which has killed approximately 14,000 people, rages on in fits and starts on the frontlines -- and in cyberspace. Ukrainian government websites were hacked in \"\"the largest cyberattack on Ukraine in the last four years,\" a Ukrainian cyber official said Wednesday, and Moscow has launched a \"disinformation storm\" portraying Ukraine as the aggressor and trying to \"build public support for a further Russian invasion,\" a senior State Department official said Thursday.\n\nThe Kremlin's campaign to destabilize its smaller, democratic neighbor allegedly includes spies on the ground, collecting information and even plotting to form a new Ukrainian government.\n\n\"Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,\" the U.S. Treasury said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. has sanctioned two sitting members of Ukrainian parliament, Taras Kozak and Oleh Voloshyn, who it accused of furthering a plot by the FSB, Russia's main security agency and the successor of the KGB. The agency, which Biden said Wednesday has forces on the ground in Ukraine, is \"destabilizing the political situation in Ukraine and laying the groundwork for creating a new, Russian-controlled government in Ukraine,\" Treasury added.\n\nIn the face of that effort, the U.S. is hoping that transparency can undercut any pretext Russian operatives or their Ukrainian colleagues may create -- just as the White House last week accused the Kremlin of positioning operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives and planning a possible \"false-flag\" operation.\n\nRussia has denied that, calling it \"complete disinformation.\" It has said repeatedly it does not plan to attack the former Soviet state, even as Putin warned that his demands, including barring Ukraine from joining NATO, be met or Russia will take \"military technical\" measures.\n\nThe U.S. is taking its own military measures, approving the transfer of more weaponry to Ukraine -- this time from Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, a State Department spokesperson confirmed, while declining to say what weapons exactly.\n\nBut a Lithuanian Ministry of Defense source told ABC News the country was given the green light to transfer to Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger portable surface-to-air missiles. The Baltic state wanted to send the weapons even earlier, but because they were originally U.S. provided, it needed American approval, which only came during consultations Wednesday, the source said.\n\nStingers are a kind of man-portable air-defense system, or MANPAD, where an individual soldier can carry the weapon and use it to down fighter aircraf..."}

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, Pool)\n\nDENVER (AP) — First,Colorado’s Supreme Courtruled that former President Donald Trump wasn’t eligible to run for his old job in that state. Then,Maine’s Democratic secretary of stateruled the same for her state. Who’s next?\n\nBoth decisions are historic. The Colorado court was the first court to apply to a presidential candidatea rarely used constitutional banagainst those who “engaged in insurrection.” Maine’s secretary of state was the first top election official to unilaterally strike a presidential candidate from the ballot under that provision.\n\nBut both decisions are on hold while the legal process plays out.\n\nThat means that Trump remains on the ballot in Colorado and Maine and that his political fate is now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Maine ruling will likely never take effect on its own. Its central impact is increasing pressure on the nation’s highest court to say clearly: Can Trump still run for president after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol?\n\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. ratified the 14th Amendment to guarantee rights to former slaves and more. It also includeda two-sentence clause called Section 3, designed to keep former Confederates from regaining government power after the war.\n\nThe measure reads:\n\n“No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.”\n\nCongress did remove that disability from most Confederates in 1872, and the provision fell into disuse. But it was rediscovered after Jan. 6.\n\nTrump is already being prosecuted for the attempt to overturn his 2020 loss that culminated with Jan. 6, but Section 3 doesn’t require a criminal conviction to take effect. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed to disqualify Trump, claiming he engaged in insurrection on Jan. 6 and is no longer qualified to run for office.\n\nAll the suits failed until the Colorado ruling. And dozens of secretaries of state have been asked to remove him from the ballot. All said they didn’t have the authority to do so without a court order — until Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows’ decision.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled on Section 3. It’s likely to do so in considering appeals of the Colorado decision — the state Republican Party hasalready appealed, and Trump is expected to file his own shortly. Bellows’ ruling cannot be appealed straight to the U.S. Supreme Court — it has to be appealed up the judicial chain first, starting with a..."}

Roske admitted in a second interview with the FBI of his intent to kill Kavanaugh and himself, according to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.\n\nRoske told detectives that \"he was upset about the leak of a recent Supreme Court draft decision regarding the right to an abortion as well as the recent school shooting in Uvalde, Texas,\" and believed Kavanaugh \"would side with Second Amendment decisions that would loosen gun control laws,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh stands before a ceremonial swearing-in at the White House on Oct. 8, 2018.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nAt approximately 1:05 a.m. Wednesday, two U.S. Marshals saw an individual, later identified as Roske, dressed in black clothing and carrying a backpack and a suitcase, get out of a taxicab that had stopped in front of Kavanaugh’s Montgomery County home.

Even if an impasse is quickly resolved, more than 2.5 million jobs could be lost if the debt ceiling isn't lifted, a 2013 study fromMacroeconomic Advisers found.\n\nSome financial experts say the White House could have options to raise the debt limit unilaterally, without congressional action.The Washington Post broke downsome of the maneuvers that include far-fetched ideas such as minting a new platinum coin, breaking the debt limit by citing other federal spending laws, or invoking the 14th Amendment and its requirement of equal protection for all citizens.\n\nFor now, the White House isn't discussing any plan B to raise the debt ceiling.

Over the years, Jones has not only used the media company to poison the public discourse with vile lies and conspiracy theories, but also to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars.\n\nPrior to Thursday, Jones had resisted converting his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation. But facing mounting legal pressure, he reversed course and caved to the demands of the Sandy Hook families, who have still not seen a penny from Jones since juries in Connecticut and Texas found him liable in 2022 for defamation and emotional distress. His lawyers said in a filing that there was “no reasonable prospect for a successful reorganization” and that continuing down the path would only result in additional expenses incurred by Jones.\n\nThe legal maneuver ultimately “means [Jones’] ownership in Free Speech Systems is going to get sold,” Avi Moshenberg, an attorney who represents some of the Sandy Hook families, told CNN on Thursday night, referencing the parent company of Infowars.\n\n“Converting the case to Chapter 7 will hasten the end of these bankruptcies and facilitate the liquidation of Jones’s assets, which is the same reason we have moved to convert his company’s case to Chapter 7,” Chris Mattei, another attorney representing Sandy Hook families, told CNN.\n\nJones technically has not controlled the Infowars business for some time, given that Free Speech Systems has also filed for bankruptcy protection. The company’s business has, thus, been under the supervision of a court appointed restructuring officer.\n\nA hearing is scheduled for next Friday to determine the fate of Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy.\n\nBut regardless of what happens in that case, Thursday’s legal move sets the stage for a court-appointed trustee to liquidate Jones’ personal assets, which includes his stake in Infowars.\n\nThe liquidation of Jones’ assets does not mean that Infowars will cease to exist. Several outcomes are possible. The court-appointed trustee could sell the business to another owner, for instance.\n\nA representative for Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

The Court’s brief decision was unsigned and Justice Clarence Thomas was the only member to note his dissent.\n\nWednesday’s decision signals a new phase for the committee’s work, which thus far has struggled to penetrate Trump’s inner circle. The papers the panel is seeking will help them reconstruct the ex-president’s activities ahead of Jan. 6, and could leverage some of his former aides into cooperating. Some, like former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have refused the committee’s requests for depositions and documents, citing Trump’s assertions of privilege.\n\nRecords the committee is seeking include Trump’s call and visitor logs and any record related to the security of the Capitol or his bid to contest the 2020 election. The National Archives holds papers of past administrations. President Joe Biden is backing the committee’s subpoenas.\n\nTrump’s appeal had support from his top aides, including Meadows and former senior adviser Stephen Miller, whose litigation outfit America First Legal filed an amicusbriefurging the Court to \"rein in\" the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nMiller’s group argued that Trump’s political enemies are exploiting their unified control of the government to rifle through his administration’s most sensitive internal documents \"to prosecute the former president and intimidate the seventy-four million Americans who voted for him.\"\n\n\"A former president’s executive privilege claim should not depend on how much he or she is despised by the ruling faction,\" the brief reads.\n\nThe Jan. 6 panel cited Meadows for contempt in December and asked the Justice Department to prosecute him. Lawyers for Meadows filed their ownbriefemphasizing that the ongoing dispute puts him and other Trump confidants—like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and lawyer John Eastman—in an impossible position.\n\n\"If they follow President Biden’s direction and provide privileged testimony to Congress, they effectively moot President Trump’s assertion of executive privilege—as well as this Court’s opportunity to clarify waiver of privilege held by former presidents,\" the brief reads. \"If they follow President Trump’s direction and defy a subpoena without first seeking judicial recourse they face the prospect of prosecution.\"\n\nThe filing urged the Court to take Trump’s case for the sake of potential witnesses caught up in the dispute. Meadows is represented by George Terwilliger, who was former attorney general William Barr’s top deputy in the George H.W. Bush administration.\n\nTrump’s lawyers generallyarguedthat the committee is on a fishing expedition, trolling White House papers in hopes of finding something that will cripple the ex-president’s political prospects. They compared the Jan. 6 subpoenas to the subpoenas House Democrats issued for Trump’s financial documents, which the High Courtpannedin July 2020.\n\nLawyers for House Democrats countered that Congress can investigate and pass legislation in response to high profile breaches of public trust, as happened after Watergate and the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s. The Biden administration agreed in its own filing, saying the committee is seeking records akin to those released during Watergate and the Iran-Contra affair.\n\n\"Congress often legislates by probing past illegality to determine why it occurred, how it could be prevented, whether more resources should be allocated to prevention, and whether and how existing laws should be changed,\" legal papers from House Democrats read.\n\nA federal trial judge in Washington and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled against Trump, prompting his appeal to the High Court. The appeals court said the incumbent president is best positioned to manage privilege claims—including those made by his predecessors—and suggested a former president can’t invoke privilege over the incumbent’s objections. Wednesday’s unsigned decision said that conclusion doesn’t control future cases, a sign some justices were troubled by the lower court’s opinion.\n\n\"Any discussion of the court of appeals concerning President Trump’s status as a former president must therefore be regarded as nonbinding,\" it reads.\n\nThe case is No. 21A272Trumpv.Thompson.\n\nTrump v.

The creation of an open category will mean that everybody has the opportunity to compete at an elite level. This has not been done before, so FINA will need to lead the way. I want all athletes to feel included in being able to develop ideas during this process.”\n\nIn November 2021,the International Olympic Committee (IOC)issued its Framework on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity and Sex Variations, saying no athlete should be excluded from competition on the assumption of an advantage due to their gender and rejected the notion that a testosterone proxy was enough to be excluded from the women’s category.\n\nSeveral months later, in January 2022, the International Federation of Sports Medicine and the European Federation of Sports Medicine Associations issued a joint position statement disputing parts of the IOC’s position.\n\nFINA says it responded by forming a working group to “consider the best available statistical, scientific, and medical evidence concerning sex differences in sports performance, and any associated male sex-based advantage,” and use the information to establish eligibility criteria for transgender athletes.\n\nThe working group was comprised of an athlete group, which FINA says included transgender athletes and coaches, a science and medicine group as well as a legal and human rights group.\n\nOn Monday, the IOC issued a statement to CNN which said that “sports at the Olympic Games are governed by the International Federations (IFs).”\n\nIt continued: “With regard to eligibility criteria for sex-segregated competition, the Framework offers guidance to IFs without being mandatory. The previous Consensus Statement published by the IOC on the topic of eligibility for trans athletes and athletes with sex variations in 2015 was also non-binding for IFs.\n\n“The IOC considers that sports bodies are well placed to define the factors that contribute to performance advantage in the context of their own sport.\n\n“They are also well placed to determine the threshold at which an advantage may become disproportionate, devise relevant criteria, and develop the mechanisms needed to offset disproportionate advantage when it is determined to be present.”\n\nRelated articleHow an Ivy League swimmer became the face of the debate on transgender women in sports\n\nThe debate on transgender women in swimming came under a spotlight when University of Pennsylvania swimmerLia Thomas, who started on the school’s men’s swimming team in 2017, eventually joined the UPenn women’s team in 2020.\n\nAt the time of her transition in 2019, the NCAA required that transgender athletes have one year of hormone replacement therapy to be cleared to compete.\n\nIn February, 16 members of the University of Pennsylvania’s swim team sent a letter to the university and the Ivy Leagueasking them to not challenge the NCAA’s new transgender athlete participation policiesthat would prevent Thomas and other transgender athletes to compete. In the letter, they argued Thomas had an “unfair advantage,” and said they supported her gender transition out of the pool but not necessarily in it.\n\nDespite the backlash, Penn Athletics and the Ivy League maintained their suppo..."}

Taylor Hoover, told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Biden checked his watch every single time a flag-draped coffin was removed from the hold of the Air Force C-17 Globemaster plane during Sunday’s ceremony at Dover Air Force Base in the president’s home state of Delaware.\n\n“They would release the salute and he looked down at his watch on every last one,” Hoover said. “All 13, he looked down at his watch.”\n\nMark Schmitz — whose 20-year-old son, Marine Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, died in the attack — corroborated Hoover’s story.\n\n“I actually leaned into my son’s mother’s ear and I said, ‘I swear to God, if he checks his watch one more time …’,” Schmitz recalled, “and that was only probably four times in. I couldn’t look at him anymore after that, just considering, especially, the time and why we were there. I found it to be the most disrespectful thing I’ve ever seen.”\n\nSchmitz also told theWashington Postof an outburst that occurred toward the end of the ceremony when one woman allegedly shouted at Biden, “I hope you burn in hell! That was my brother!”\n\nSchmitz added that his family’s own meeting with Biden prior to the ceremony “didn’t go well.”\n\n“He talked a bit more about his own son [Beau Biden] than he did my son,” Schmitz said, “and that didn’t sit well with me.”\n\n“When he just kept talking about his son so much, it was just — my interest was lost in that. I was more focused on my own son than what happened with him and his son,” Schmitz told the Washington Post. “I’m not trying to insult the president, but it just didn’t seem that appropriate to spend that much time on his own son.”\n\nDuring the meeting, Schmitz reportedly took out a photo of his son to show to the president.\n\n“I said, ‘Don’t you ever forget that name. Don’t you ever forget that face. Don’t you ever forget the names of the other 12,’” he said. “‘And take some time to learn their stories.’”\n\nBiden reportedly offered a blunt response: “I do know their stories.”\n\nHoover said he and his family declined to meet with Biden.\n\n“We said, ‘Absolutely not.’ We didn’t want to deal with him,” he said. “We didn’t want — we didn’t want him anywhere near us. We as a family decided that was the way it was going to be.”\n\nThe Aug. 26 attackoutside the Abbey Gate of Hamid Karzai International Airport killed 13 US service members — 11 Marines, a Navy corpsman and an Army soldier — and 169 Afghans. It was one of the final catastrophes visited upon the effort to evacuate Americans and their allies from Afghanistan —which concluded Mondaywith hundreds of Americans being left behind, along with thousands of Afghans who aided US-led forces during their two-decade military operation in that country.\n\nIn the days since the attack, manyfamily members of the fallen have criticized Biden. Steve Nikoui toldthe Daily Beastthat the president had “turned his back” on Nikoui’s son Kareem, another Marine who died at the airport.\n\nOn the same day, Schmitz toldSt. Louis radio station KMOXto “be afraid of our leadership, or lack thereof. Pray every day for the soldiers that are putting their lives at risk and doing what they love, which is protecting all of us. I think they’re the only ones that we can honestly say have our backs.”\n\nThe family of 20-year-old Marine Rylee McCollum has expressed the most anger toward the president, with his mother, Kathy, calling Biden “a dementia-ridden piece of crap who doesn’t even know he’s in the White House” in a radio interview.\n\nMeanwhile, McCollum’s sister Roice claimed her brother’s pregnant widow, Jiennah, felt the president showed “total disregard to the loss of our Marine — our brother, son, husband, and father” when Biden spoke to her at Dover.“You can’t f— up as bad as he did and say you’re sorry,” Roice told the Washington Post. “This did not need to happen, and every life is on his hands, the thousands of Afghans who will suffer and be tortured is a direct result of his incompetence.” Roice McCollum added that Biden checked his watch while speaking with her brother’s widow and described the president’s comments as scripted and shallow.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki did not deny that Biden was checking the time when she was asked by Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich, “Was the president looking at his watch and does he have a message to those people who felt that they were offended?”\n\nPsaki instead pivoted, saying Biden wanted to convey to the families that “he knows firsthand what it’s like to lose a child and the fact that … there’s no words that are going to fill that hole that is left by that.”\n\nThe press secretary..."}

Social media posts decried the quality of face masks, test kits and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines – China’s Sinovac inoculation.\n\nThe clandestine operation has not been previously reported. It aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China, theReuters investigationfound.\n\nIt identified at least 300 accounts on X, formerly Twitter, that matched descriptions shared by former US military officials familiar with the operation. Almost all were created in the middle of 2020 and centred on the slogan #Chinaangvirus – Tagalog for “China is the virus.”\n\n“COVID came from China and the VACCINE also came from China, don’t trust China!” one typical tweet from July 2020 read. The words were posted next to a photo of a syringe beside a Chinese flag and a soaring chart of infections. Another post read: “From China – PPE, Face Mask, Vaccine: FAKE. But the Coronavirus is real.”\n\nAfter Reuters asked X about the accounts, the social media company removed the profiles, determining they were part of a coordinated bot campaign based on activity patterns and internal data.\n\nThe US military’s anti-vax effort began in the spring of 2020 and expanded beyond Southeast Asia before it was terminated in mid-2021.\n\nThe Pentagon tailored the campaign to local audiences across Central Asia and the Middle East using a combination of fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to spread fear of China’s vaccines among Muslims at a time when the virus was killing tens of thousands of people each day.\n\nA key part of the strategy: amplify the disputed contention that, because vaccines sometimes contain pork gelatin, China’s shots could be considered forbidden under Islamic law.\n\nThe military programme started under former President Donald Trump and continued months into Joe Biden’s presidency – even after alarmed social media executives warned the new administration that the Pentagon had been trafficking in COVID misinformation, Reuters said.\n\nThe Biden White House issued an edict in spring 2021 banning the anti-vax effort, which also disparaged vaccines produced by other rivals, and the Pentagon initiated an internal review.\n\nSpokespeople for Trump and Biden did not respond to requests for comment about the clandestine programme, Reuters reported.\n\nA senior Department of Defense official acknowledged the US military engaged in secret propaganda to disparage China’s vaccine in the developing world, but the unnamed official declined to provide details.\n\nA Pentagon spokeswoman said the US military “uses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the US, allies and partners”. She alleged China started a “disinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of COVID-19”.\n\nIn an email, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it has long maintained the US government manipulates social media and spreads misinformation.\n\nA spokesperson for the Philippines Department of Health said the “findings by Reuters deserve to be investigated and heard by the appropriate authorities of the involved countries”.\n\nSome American public health experts condemned the Pentagon programme, saying it put civilians in jeopardy for potential geopolitical gain.\n\n“I don’t think it’s defensible,” said Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of Medicine. “I’m extremely dismayed, disappointed and disillusioned to hear that the US government would do that.”\n\nThe effort to stoke fear about Chinese inoculations risked undermining overall public trust in government health initiatives, including US-made vaccines that became available later, Lucey and others said.\n\nAlthough the Chinese vaccines were found to be less effective than the American-led shots by Pfizer and Moderna, all were approved by the World Health Organization. Sinovac did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“It should have been in our interest to get as much vaccine in people’s arms as possible,” said Greg Treverton, former chairman of the US National Intelligence Council, which coordinates the analysis and strategy of Washington’s many spy agencies.\n\nWhat the Pentagon did, Treverton said, “cros..."}

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — In a major easing of pandemic travel restrictions, the U.S. said Monday it will allow foreigners to fly into the country this fall if they have vaccination proof and a negative COVID-19 test — changes replacing a hodgepodge of rules that had kept out many non-citizens and irritated allies in Europe and beyond where virus cases are lower.\n\nThe changes, to take effect in November, will allow families and others who have been separated by the travel restrictions for 18 months to plan for long-awaited reunifications and allow foreigners with work permits to get back to their jobs in the U.S.\n\nAirlines, business groups and travelers cheered — though they also called the step long overdue.\n\n“It’s a happy day. Big Apple, here I come!” said French entrepreneur Stephane Le Breton, 45, finally able to book a trip to New York City that had been put on hold over the virus restrictions.\n\nThe new policy will replace a patchwork of travel bans first instituted by President Donald Trump last year and tightened by President Joe Biden that restrict travel by non-citizens who have in the prior 14 days been in the United Kingdom, European Union, China, India, Iran, Republic of Ireland, Brazil or South Africa.\n\nWhite House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients announced the new policies, which still will require all foreign travelers flying to the U.S. to demonstrate proof of vaccination before boarding, as well as proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within three days of flight. Biden will also tighten testing rules for unvaccinated American citizens, who will need to be tested within a day before returning to the U.S., as well as after they arrive home.\n\nThe tougher rules for unvaccinated Americans come as the White House has moved to impose sweeping vaccination-or-testing requirements affecting as many as 100 million people in an effort to encourage holdouts to get shots.\n\nFully vaccinated passengers will not be required to quarantine, Zients said.\n\nThere will be no immediate change to U.S. land border policies, which restrict much cross-border travel with Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe travel bans had become the source of growing geopolitical frustration, particularly among allies in the UK and EU. The easing comes ahead of Biden meeting with some European leaders on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly this week.\n\n“This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it’s a stronger system,” Zients said.\n\nThe EU and UK had previously moved to allow vaccinated U.S. travelers in without quarantines, in an effort to boost business and tourism. But the EU recommended last month that some travel restrictions be reimposed on U.S. travelers to the bloc because of the rampant spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus in America.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will require airlines to collect contact information from international travelers to facilitate tracing, Zients said.\n\nThe U.S. will accept full vaccination of travelers with any of the vaccines appro..."}

She was removed from the Education and Budget committees in February 2021 for online activity that included spreading QAnon conspiracy theories and liking a Facebook post that said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should be executed.\n\nEarlier this year, Greene came under fire for giving the keynote speech at the America First Political Action Conference, hosted byHolocaust-denying white supremacistNicholas Fuentes — who said during the event: “[They say Russian President] Vladimir Putin is Hitler and they say that’s not a good thing.”\n\nGreene also drew ire from within her own party forheckling Biden during the State of the Union addressalongside Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.). Greene had yelled out “Build the wall!” while Biden talked about securing the border and was seen making faces and talking during the speech.\n\nThe congresswoman’s main challenger, Jennifer Strahan, had accused the incumbent of caring about her own profile more than her constituents.\n\n“This is not the time for unserious politicians who just want to hear themselves talk,” Strahan said in one campaign ad, which didn’t mention Greene by name.\n\nBut Greene managed to become one of Congress’ biggest fundraisers — amassing $9 million for her reelection bid with none of her challengers even hitting the $400,000 mark, according to the Associated Press. She spent $6.6 million before the primary, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nAll the while, Greene kept making inflammatory statements, cutting an ad of her own calling Biden and Pelosi “communist Democrats” who “hate America, hate God and hate our way of life.”\n\nAlso seeking the seat were executive Eric Cunningham, engineer James Haygood, retired physician Charles Lutin and Marine Corps veteran Seth Synstelien\n\nThe frontrunner for the Democratic Party nomination was Army veteran Marcus Flowers, who was expected to beat small business owner Hollie McCormack and former Rome city commissioner Wendy Davis.\n\nWith Post wires\n\nStrictly necessary cookies are essential for the website to function correctly.

On this day, black-clad, anti-capitalist protesters were attacking a Democratic Party office, and Rosas managed to record them from close range without being spotted.\n\nWithin minutes of the vandalism, by a handful of activists who broke off froma small #J20 march, Rosasposted his video on Twitter, where it racked up over 1 million views.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1352042522868998144\n\nWith his tweet, Rosas had also beaten his friend and rival, Jorge Ventura of the conservative Daily Caller, by six minutes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VenturaReport/status/1352044041131577345\n\nVentura, whowent undercoverto infiltrate the protest movement in Portland last summer, got less dramatic footage of this incident, but his 15-second clip, which showed that there were more people photographing the destruction in Portland than taking part in it, was still seen by more than 100,000 people.\n\nWhen Rosasjoined Laura Ingraham on Fox Newsthat night, giving national attention to what would have been, before the era of viral video, justa local news story, Ventura held the camera for the live shot.\n\nWe know that because a third member of the conservative protest paparazzi that descended on Portland that day, Newsmax contributor James Klüg, gave viewers of his video bloga behind-the-scenes lookat how the viral video-to-Fox News pipeline works.\n\nOn the air, Ingraham attributed the destruction to “antifa thugs,” using the right-wing shorthand that lumps everyone with left-of-center politics into one undifferentiated mass. Rosas, who was standing in front ofa Circle-A— a symbol for anarchism, not anti-fascism — that had been spray-painted beside the ruined front door of the Democratic Party office, made no effort to correct her.\n\n“The antifa groups here, they do not like Biden just as much they don’t like Trump,” he said. “They just hate America in general.” (In fact, Rose City Antifa, the Portland group that helped revive the Nazi-era concept of anti-fascism in the United States, releaseda statementmaking clear that this attack on the Democratic office was not the work of anti-fascists but rather of anarchists and anti-capitalists. “While many of the people involved may consider themselves antifascists in ideology,” the activists said, “we narrowly define antifascism as actions taken to oppose the insurgent right-wing.”)\n\nAs a reporter focused on protest movements, I’ve been studying video of chaotic events at demonstrations for more than a decade, since Ilive-blogged Iran’s disputed electionand then coveredthe Arab Springand Occupy protests, fromthe United StatestoBrazil. And one thing I’ve learned is that, whether a clip was posted online by a witness in Cairo or Kenosha, it always helps to know who shot the video, and why.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism.

At protests in Minneapolis, Dallas, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, Louisville, Philadelphia, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, I discovered that many of the most viral clips were shot by a handful of field reporters for right-wing sites or freelancers with conservative politics.\n\nRosas and Ventura are not household names, but it’s important to understand their reporting, because they are members of an informal club of right-wing video journalists who roam from city to city, feeding the conservative media’s hunger for images of destruction and violence on the margins of left-wing protests.\n\nIn the year since George Floyd’s murder by Derek Chauvin was documented in horrifying detailon the cellphone of a 17-year-old witness, Darnella Frazier, right-wing news outlets and politicians have been desperate to draw attention away from those unbearable images by focusing instead on viral videos of unrest at racial justice protests. That’s been a boon for the careers of conservative video journalists like Rosas, Ventura, and a half-dozen of their friends, who jokingly call themselves the #RiotSquad inInstagram ..."}

Judges ruled Friday that election supervisors in Broward and Palm Beach counties had to release how many votes still had to be counted.\n\nUpdated at 4:05 p.m. ET\n\nTwo top elections in Florida are heading for recounts, with voters almost evenly divided on candidates in the state's races for governor and the U.S. Senate. Unofficial vote tallies from all of Florida's 67 counties were turned in at noon on Saturday, and the narrow vote margins triggered machine recounts, which must be completed by Thursday.\n\nThe most acrimonious of the elections may be the U.S. Senate race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson, which will have national consequences. If Scott is able to retain his lead, it would expand the Republican majority in the Senate, which currently stands at 51 seats.\n\nScott's lead had narrowed to .15 percentage points, or about 12,500 votes, by Saturday afternoon. Florida law requires a machine recount when the leading candidate's margin is 0.5 percentage points or less.\n\nNelson has filed a federal lawsuit asking to postpone the deadline for submitting election results and a motion over the process of validating signatures on provisional and absentee ballots.\n\nScott also filed lawsuits in both Broward and Palm Beach counties demanding election supervisors there reveal how many votes are left to count, and judges ruled Friday that those election supervisors had to release that information.\n\nPresident Trump weighed in with support for Scott, calling the potential for a recount a \"fraud,\" and referring to one of Nelson's attorneys, Marc Elias, in a tweet on Saturday.\n\nAs soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don’t worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\n\nIn the race for governor, a congressman allied with Trump, Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, is facing off against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee. DeSantis' lead has narrowedto .41 percentage points — about 33,000 votes.\n\nGillum initially conceded the race on election night, but as the voting results narrowed, he asked that every vote be counted.\n\n\"We traveled all across this state in the primary and the general process. We went to red areas, and to blue areas, and to purple areas of this state, and I fought hard for every single vote that we got,\" Gillum said at a news conference on Saturday. \"I fought hard even for the votes that I didn't get, and in this process, I am fully committed to seeing every one of those votes counted.\"\n\nThe disputes in Florida's elections recall the swing state's 2000 presidential recount, when the election for U.S. president was delayed for several weeks over hanging chads.\n\nPolitical consultant Matthew Dowd worked on George W. Bush's campaign for U.S. president that year, and tweeted, \"Not counting all the votes in Florida in 2000 was a grave injustice and caused many to question the legitimacy of Bush election. Let us not repeat that injustice in FL and AZ this year. Count all the votes.\"\n\nTrump has called into question the validity of the recounts, saying in a tweet and without evidence, that they are an attempt to steal Florida's big elections.\n\nTrying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\n\nIf any of the races are within a margin of 0.25 of a percentage point or less after the machine recount,a manual recountwould be triggered. The deadline for those results would be Sunday, Nov. 18.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said a manual recount would have to be completed by Thursday. If such a count is triggered, the results would be due Sunday, Nov. 18.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"}

For years he had noticed and criticized a bias not only in the mainstream media’s coverage of the pandemic, but also in the way it was presented on platforms like Twitter.\n\nWe couldn’t think of anyone better to tackle this story. — BW\n\nI had always thought a primary job of the press was to be skeptical of power—especially the power of the government. But during the Covid-19 pandemic, I and so many others found that the legacy media had shown itself to largely operate as a messaging platform for our public health institutions. Those institutions operated in near total lockstep, in part bypurging internal dissidentsanddiscrediting outside experts.\n\nTwitter became an essential alternative. It was a place where those with public health expertise and perspectives at odds with official policy could air their views—and where curious citizens could find such information. This often included other countries’ responses to Covid that differed dramatically from our own.\n\nBut it quickly became clear that Twitter also seemed to promote content that reinforced the establishment narrative, and to suppress views and even scientific evidence that ran to the contrary.\n\nWas I imagining things? Was the pattern I and others witnessed proof of purposeful intent? An algorithm gone rogue? Or something else? In other words: When it came to Covid, and the information shared on a service used by hundreds of millions of people, what exactly was being amplified? And what was being banned or censored?\n\nSo whenThe Free Pressasked if I would go to Twitter to peek behind the curtain, I took the first flight out of New York.\n\nHere’s what I found.\n\nThe United States government pressured Twitter to elevate certain content and suppress other content about Covid-19 and the pandemic. Internal emails that I viewed at Twitter showed that both the Trump and Biden administrations directly pressed Twitter executives to moderate the platform’s content according to their wishes.\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, the Trump administration was especially concerned about panic buying, and sought “help from the tech companies to combat misinformation,” according to emails sent by Twitter employees in the wake of meetings with the White House. One area of so-called misinformation: “runs on grocery stores.” The trouble is that it wasn't misinformation: Thereactually wereruns on goods.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just Twitter. The meetings with the Trump White House were also attended by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others.\n\nWhen the Biden administration took over, its agenda for the American people can be summed up as: Be very afraid of Covid and do exactly what we say to stay safe.\n\nIn July 2021, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released a 22-page advisory concerning what the World Health Organization referred to as an “infodemic,” and called on social media platforms to do more to shut down “misformation.”\n\n“We are asking them to step up,” Murthy said. “We can’t wait longer for them to take aggressive action.”\n\nThat’s the message the White House had already taken directly to Twitter executives in private channels. One of the Biden administration’s first meeting requests was about Covid, with a focus on “anti-vaxxer accounts,” according to a meeting summary by Lauren Culbertson, Twitter’s Head of U.S. Public Policy.\n\nThey were especially concerned about Alex Berenson, a journalist skeptical of lockdowns and mRNA vaccines, who had hundreds of thousands of followers on the platform:\n\nBy the summer of 2021, the day after Murthy’s memo, Biden announced publicly that social media companies were “killing people” by allowing misinformation about vaccines. Just hours later, Twitterlocked Berensonout of his account, and then permanently suspended him the next month. Berenson sued Twitter. He ultimately settled with the company, and is now back on the platform. As part of the lawsuit, Twitter was compelled to provide certaininternal communications. They revealed that the White House had directly met with Twitter employees and pressured them to take action on Berenson.\n\nThe summary of meetings by Culbertson, emailed to colleagues in December 2022, adds new evidence of the White House’s pressure campaign, and illust..."}

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.\n\nAlaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance in approving the Willow Project and how it would benefit the U.S. economy and energy sector.\n\nThe Biden administration announced Monday that it is moving forward with approving a massive 30-year oil drilling project in Alaska over objections from climate activists and Democratic lawmakers about its environmental impact.\n\nThe Department of Interior (DOI) approved three of the five drilling sites proposed by oil company ConocoPhillipsas part of its Willow Projectin the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A) located in North Slope Borough, Alaska. ConocoPhillips previously stated that, for the project to remain economically viable, the federal government would need to approve at least three of the sites.\n\nAccording to the record of decision published by the Bureau of Land Management, the administration is also flatly rejecting the two other drilling sites and associated infrastructure proposed by ConocoPhillips. And the Houston-based company agreed to forfeit about 68,000 acres of drilling rights that it owns for a separate project.\n\nThe decision noted that the approved option would produce the fewest greenhouse gas emissions compared to all alternatives and the DOI said, by denying two of the drilling sites, it was \"substantially reducing the size of the project.\"\n\nBIDEN APPEARS TO GO OFF SCRIPT TO SAY US NEEDS OIL, GAS DRILLING\n\nPresident Biden is pictured next to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland at the White House on Oct. 8, 2021.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\n\"The Record of Decision denies two of the five drill site pads proposed by ConocoPhillips, reducing the project’s drill pads by 40 percent,\" the DOI said in a statement. \"The concurrent relinquishment of 68,000 acres by the company of its existing northernmost and southernmost leases within the Bear Tooth Unit reduces the Bear Tooth Unit’s footprint in the NPR-A by one-third.\"\n\n\"This reduces the project’s freshwater use and eliminates all infrastructure related to the two rejected drill sites, including approximately 11 miles of roads, 20 miles of pipelines, and 133 acres of gravel, all of which reduces potential impacts to caribou migration and subsistence users.\"\n\nWhile the DOI issued the final decision Monday morning, President Biden and senior White House officials have been actively involved in overseeing the approval process.\n\nThe final record of decision, meanwhile, comes years after ConocoPhillips first proposed the project. Willow was originally approved under the Trump administration before a federal judge ordered the government to conduct a more rigorous environmental analysis following a legal challenge from climate advocacy groups.\n\nBIDEN EXPECTED TO APPROVE ENORMOUS OIL DRILLING PROJECT IN BLOW TO CLIMATE ACTIVISTS: 'COMPLETE BETRAYAL'\n\nThe company has forecasted the project will produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, create more than 2,500 construction jobs and 300 long-term jobs, and deliver as much as $17 billion in revenue for the federal government, Alaska and local communities, many of which are Indigenous. The project willlead to the constructionof up to 250 wells, multiple pipelines, a central processing plant, an airport and a gravel mine.\n\nOver its three-decade lifespan,Willow is projected to produceup to 614 million barrels of oil. In 2022, producers in the U.S. drilled for 4.3 billion barrels of oil on federal lands and waters.\n\nOil pipelines stretch across the landscape outside Nuiqsut, Alaska, where ConocoPhillips operates the Alpine Field on May 28, 2019.(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\n\"The permitting and environmental review process encompassed a period of well over two years and included multiple rounds of public comment and public meetings with Alaska Native stakeholders,\" Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) President Julie Kitka wrote in a letter to Haaland last year.\n\n\"AFN understands that the need for a proactive whole of government approach to deal with climate change; however fossil fuels will be with us for quite some time to come, and projects like Willow can help bridge the gap,\" Kitka continued. \"The Willow Project could jumpstart our economy with thousands of jobs and be a model in community and environmental stewardship for future opportunities.\"\n\nIn addition to the AFN, the largest group representing Natives in Alaska, Willow also received strong support from the state's entire legislature, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, labor unions, elected leaders of the North Slope Borough and Alaska's entire congressional delegation — Republican Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa M..."}

The president is newly flush with billions in funding and wants to deport 1 million people a year with the help of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\n\"America needs you,\" reads one of the ICE recruiting ads, featuring a finger-pointing Uncle Sam,evoking World War I recruitingposters. \"America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.\"\n\nThe federal spending plan finances the hiring of 10,000 new ICE agents, making ICE the single-largest law enforcement agency in the country, larger than the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies combined. For comparison, the FBI has only about 13,700 special agents, according to the Justice Department.\n\nEven before the new hires take their posts, the dramatic expansion of public ICE operations has upset communities from coast to coast and raised questions about the tactics agents have used as they'vechased suspects across Home Depot parking lots, farm fields andinto medical buildings.\n\nThe aggressive recruitment efforts have also angered local sheriffs who worry that deputies in already understaffed offices will be lured away by the big bonuses and higher pay.\n\n\"It is tone-deaf and reflects a total lack of judgment and character on their part,\" Jonathan Thompson, executive director and CEO of the National Sheriff's Association, said of a recruiting offer emailed to local deputies nationwide. \"This is either galactically stupid or purposefully malicious. You're just robbing Peter to pay Paul. And in this case, you're robbing the poorest of Peter to pay the richest of Paul.\"\n\nThompson said a White House official later called him to apologize about the recruiting email, and to promise to work more collaboratively with the sheriffs.\n\nBolstered by new staffing, federal officials havepromised to further floodDemocrat-run cities with deportation officers in response to a lack of cooperation in executing Trump's get-tough approach that has targeted undocumented immigrations with or without criminal records.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has already begun hiring for the new jobs. Federal officials are planning a social media blitz to reach recruits, potentially advertising on YouTube and SnapChat, but also on connected TVs via Hulu and Amazon Prime.\n\nIn addition to the signing bonuses, ICE is offering up to $60,000 in student loan forgiveness, although applicants don't need to have college degrees to be considered for some of the jobs.\n\nICE officials on July 31announced they've made 1,000 job offerssince Trump signed the funding law. Among those receiving job offers are retired ICE agents who quit during the Biden administration, acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement.\n\n\"They couldn’t do the jobs they signed up to do,\" Lyons said. \"Now, people are lining up to work with us because they know our officers and agents are allowed to enforce immigration law fairly and across the board, and that’s a cause people really believe in.\"\n\nWhite House officials say there has been an830% increase in assaultsagainst agents through July 14 compared with the same period last year, and therecruiting materials say that applicants\"should expect a certain level of risk\" but that they will be trained to take \"every precaution\" to stay safe.\n\nHow quickly ICE can bring aboard the new employees remains uncertain. U.S. Customs and Border Protection haslong struggled to hireBorder Patrol agents, who typically take more than 300 days to bring aboard, according to a 2024 GAO study.\n\nJoe Gamaldi, national vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police union, said he suspects ICE will face the same recruiting challenges as local departments. He said years of demonizing law enforcement by some politicians, activists and media has created a \"toxic cocktail\" that will make hiring challenging.\n\n\"Truth be told, all police agencies are competing for a small pool of people who are still willing to serve and literally die for their communities,\" he said. \"Bonuses and better pay will help, but ultimately police officers, and those interested in police work, want to serve for an agency and communities that appreciate them and don’t treat them like scum.\"\n\nThe aggressive hiring campaign has frustrated local law enforcement leaders who worry their officers will flock to better-paying federal jobs. Without telling local sheriffs ahead of time, ICE officials directly emailed recruitment offers to hundreds of deputies across the country.\n\nThompson, of the National Sheriff's Association, said sheriffs feel betrayed by the move. Thompson said sheriffs agreed to send deputies to special immigration enforcement training designed for local police, only to have ICE try to simply poach them away.\n\n\"It..."}

Gavin Newsom urged voters Sunday to turn back a looming recall vote that could remove him from office, while leading Republican Larry Elder broadly criticized the media for what he described as double standards that insulated Newsom from criticism and scrutiny throughout the contest.\n\nThe sunny, late-summer weekend was a swirl of political activity, as candidates held rallies, continued bus tours and cluttered the TV airwaves with advertising offering their closing arguments in advance of the election that concludes Tuesday.\n\nNewsom — who is expecting President Joe Biden on Monday for a capstone get-out-the-vote rally in Long Beach — was in a largely Hispanic area on the northern edge of Los Angeles, where he sought to drive up turnout with the key voting bloc.\n\nElder also was in Los Angeles, where he was joined by activist and former actress Rose McGowan, who repeated her claims from recent days that Newsom’s wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, attempted to persuade her in 2017 not to go public with her allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nSiebel Newsom’s office described the allegations as a “complete fabrication.” In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Newsom characterized McGowan’s claims as a “last-minute classic hit piece” from one of Elder’s supporters.\n\nThe governor called Elder desperate and grasping, saying McGowan’s claims about his wife “just..."}

At one point the 73-year-old quipped \"if YouTube were a newspaper, how much would it weigh\".\n\nHenry Whitaker, Florida's solicitor general, laid out the conservative argument for the court, claiming that tech giants applied censorship policies \"in an inconsistent manner\" to \"deplatform\" certain users.\n\n\"They contend that they possess a broad First Amendment right to censor anything they host on their sites, even when doing so contradicts their own representations to consumers,\" Mr Whitaker said. \"But the design of the First Amendment is to prevent the suppression of speech, not to enable it.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who was removed from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the wake of his inflammatory comments during the Capitol riot, filed in support of the state laws. He argued that tech firms' \"decision to discriminate against a user\" is not protected under the Constitution.\n\nBut a trade group representing the tech giants, and supported by the Biden administration, told the court on Monday that the laws would infringe on their own First Amendment rights by effectively barring them from removing content or accounts which they do not want on their sites - or which would usually be removed under content policies.\n\nPaul Clement, a lawyer presenting the cases on behalf of NetChoice, cited previous Supreme Court rulings that held that private organisers could not be forced to carry messages they did not agree with.\n\nHe also suggested that if companies were prevented from moderating content they could be forced to carry all sorts of objectionable content, including antisemitic and pro-suicide posts.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh, a conservative justice appointed by Mr Trump, challenged Mr Whitaker to reconcile the Florida law with prior Supreme Court rulings that \"emphasise editorial control as being fundamentally protected by the First Amendment\".\n\nJustices seemed sceptical of the sprawling nature of the laws, which they said may be unconstitutional where applied to a Facebook post, but may be permitted when protecting communications on other non-expressive apps, such as the provision of email services.\n\nJustice Alito and Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, both raised the possibility of returning the case to a lower court to further develop who exactly is covered by the Florida bill in particular.\n\nUS Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, speaking in support of the tech lobby's case, urged the court to rule narrowly on what she called a \"defect\" in the Texas law, rather than issuing broad findings on how the first amendment interacts with social media.\n\nConservatives in the US have long assailed tech giants over their moderation policies, which they say is unfairly biased towards left-wing views.\n\nWhen signing the Texas bill into law, Gov Greg Abbott said: \"It is now law that conservative viewpoints in Texas cannot be banned on social media.\"\n\nThe US president indicates he will go ahead with a lawsuit against the BBC over how his speech was presented by Panorama.\n\nThe Kennedy heir, who will be challenging for a New York seat, is best known for his outspoken political commentary online.\n\nIf he were to bring a defamation case in Florida, experts say he would need to prove three major components.\n\nPresident Vucic has traded barbs with the Kremlin amid differences over gas supplies and Serbia's arms trade.\n\nThe US Navy's Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier is considered the world's largest warship.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Despite a decades-long history of flash floods in the Texas Hill Country, and a 1987 flash flood that killed 10 teenagers at a Christian Camp in neighboring Kendall County, Kerr County didn’t have an emergency warning system in place.\n\nThis legislative session, a bill to create a coordinated emergency warning system and provide grant funding for rural communities died in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe NWS-Austin/San Antonio issued a Flood Watch Wednesday for several counties, including Kerr County; the NWS San Angelo also issued a flood watch for several counties.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, TDEM activated state emergency response resources through 10 state agencies anticipating increased threats of flooding in West and Central Texas ahead of the holiday weekend.\n\n“According to the National Weather Service, heavy rainfall with the potential to cause flash flooding is anticipated across West Texas and the Hill Country beginning tonight and is expected to last a few days. Texans are encouraged to monitor local forecasts and avoid driving or walking into flooded areas,” TDEM said. The next day, it escalated state emergency operations readiness and activated additional resources.\n\nAt 1:14 am on Friday, the NWS Austin/San Antonio issued a “life threatening flash flooding” warning for Bandera and Kerr counties, stating, “Some locations that will experience flash flooding include, Kerrville, Ingram, Hunt, Waltonia, Kerr Wildlife Management Area and Lost Maples State Natural Area.”\n\nThe NWS also had five people on duty, more than the standard two, to deliver forecasts for its Austin/San Antonio office covering the region, Jason Runyen, a NWS meteorologist, said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also said, \"The National Weather Service executed timely, precise forecasting and warnings, despite unprecedented rainfall overwhelming the region.\" It alsopublisheda timeline of NWS alerts.\n\n“These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather, which also issued reports on Thursday, citing NWS alerts, said.\n\nBy 4 a.m. on Friday, heavy rain caused the Guadeloupe River to rise by more than 26 feet in less than an hour resulting in a flash flood that tore through structures, wiped out RV parks, camper vans and cabins where vacationers or residents were sleeping.\n\nAt a news conference on Friday, Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said he didn’t know why Camp Mystic and other camps in the county weren’t evacuated.\n\n“Why weren't these camps evacuated?” a reporter asked.\n\n\\“I can't answer that,” the judge replied. “I don't know.”\n\n“You're the judge … the top official here in this county. … There's kids missing. These camps were in harm's way,” the reporter said.\n\nThe judge replied that no one knew “this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States and we deal with floods on a regular basis. When it rains, we get water. We had no reason to believe that this was going to be any anything like what's happened.”\n\nOn Sunday, Kelly said that several years ago, county officials considered implementing a flood warning system that would function like a tornado warning siren, before he was elected, but never did.\n\nKXAN first reported that county officials didn’t issue warnings until four hours after the NWS alerts, after 5 a.m. and 7 a.m., well after an untold number of people had already been swept away.\n\nThe Texas House, under former Speaker Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, sought to address crisis communication failures at the local and state level last year.\n\nAfter a disastrous state response to the Panhandle Wildfires, which destroyed more than 1.2 million acres and caused more than $1 billion in economic losses, the Texas House launched an investigation and proposed solutions. State Rep. Ken King introduced a bill to provide grant funding for rural community emergency alert systems and streamline and improve first responder communications. It passed the House with bipartisan support, with 16 Republicans voting against it, only to die in the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nIt remains unclear why Camp Mystic didn’t evacuate children on Thursday after the first NWS and TDEM warnings were issued. Mo-Ranch Camp near Hunt moved several hundred campers and attendees to higher ground; nearby Camps Rio Vista and Sierra Vista ended their summer session early on Thursday.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, authorities in Kerr County ha..."}

This sets a very very dark precedent.\"\n\nPeterson also tagged GoFundMe and the prime minister's official Twitter account.\n\nHowever, it is not clear that Prime Minister Trudeau played any role in GoFundMe's decision. The Canadian House of Commons' committee on public safety voted unanimously on Thursday to call GoFundMe to testify about theFreedom Convoy's fundraiser.\n\nThe committee is seeking information about what measures GoFundMe has in place to \"ensure the fundsare not being used to promote extremism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, which have been expressed among prominent organizers for the truck convoy currently in Ottawa.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr., former PresidentDonald Trump's eldest son, sent a series of tweets and retweets about the matter and called for U.S. state attorneys general to investigate.\n\n\"All GOP Attorney Generals should be looking at this & helping to get people their $$$ back so it can be redirected to the truckers,\" Trump Jr. wrote. \"Don't let @gofundme scam you... call your AGs & let them know.

In addition, data from England signals that Omicron infection is associated with a 15 to 20 percent reduced risk in requiring any hospital treatment, compared with Delta.\n\nHowever, Neil Ferguson, director of the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, cautioned that comparing the Scottish and English data would not be comparing apples with apples since they analyze different groups.\n\nThe Scottish data looks at people admitted to hospital, whereas the English data takes in more cases, including people who visit an accident and emergency department for just a few hours of monitoring before going home, he told journalists in a briefing Wednesday.\n\nWhile limited, the data provide a first sign that Omicron may not be as virulent as the Delta strain. These datasets will be followed up over the coming weeks and will provide a clearer picture of the true risks of severe disease as time goes, the researchers said.\n\nIn the meantime, given how transmissible Omicron is, they urged that existing measures to curb the rates of infection are followed. Even if fewer people become seriously ill, with very high numbers of cases, those in need of hospital treatment could still overwhelm the health system.\n\nThese are the first studies to report on analysis of hospitalizations with Omicron; the U.K. Health Security Agency is alsoexpected to releaseits data indicating similar results before Christmas.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday ruled out additional restrictions before Christmas but said his government was keeping the data \"under review.\"\n\nPreliminaryresults from Scotland, drawn from linked vaccination and hospitalization data for the entire Scottish population, have shown a 56 percent reduction in hospitalization in people aged 20 to 50 years with Omicron infection, compared with what would be expected with the Delta variant. Given the limitations of the data, the true value lies somewhere between 30 to 75 percent for this age group, the researchers pointed out.\n\nAcross all ages, the data suggests that Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization when compared to Delta. However, there have been very few cases of Omicron recorded in older populations, which skews the results.\n\nWith age being a risk factor for hospitalization for prior variants including Delta, it is not clear from this study if the lower hospitalization rates in older people are due to them being highly boosted with a third vaccine dose or if the variant causes milder disease.\n\nThe study also has some major statistical caveats. It assumes the time to hospital admission is the same for both variants — between five to 10 days after a positive test. If it turns out that Omicron takes more days before patients are hospitalized, then this study undercounts Omicron hospital cases. It also does not take into account if there is waning immunity from boosters.\n\nMark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, told journalists in a briefing the data \"only takes us so far, but it definitely takes us in the right direction.” He also cautioned that the size of the Omicron wave is “still the big unknown.”\n\nIn a second study, researchers at Imperial College London haveanalyzeddata in England that included 56,000 cases of Omicron and 269,000 cases of Delta.\n\nTheir data suggests that individuals infected with Omicron are 15 to 20 percent less likely to attend hospital overall, and 40 to 45 percent less likely to be hospitalized for a night or more, compared with Delta cases.\n\nThe researchers also analyzed the impact of prior infection and found that those infected with Omicron after a previous infection were 50 to 60 percent less likely to be hospitalized, compared with people with no previous documented infection.\n\nThe researchers caution that insufficient time has passed since Omicron was first detected in England to analyze more severe outcomes such as intensive care unit admission or death.\n\n“It is one step towards understanding the severity of Omicron, not the final analysis,” Ferguson said, adding: “It’s clearly good news to a degree.”\n\nThese datasets have been shared with the scientific modeling groups, which subsequently make recommendations to the government based on their projections.\n\nBritain has offered to increase the threshold at which the NHS pays firms for medicines.

I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume.” But he also seemed to shrug this lie off. “We do stupid things in life,” he said.\n\nSantos was similarly dismissive of reporting on his false claims of Jewish heritage. “I never claimed to be Jewish,”Santos said to the Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish, I claimed to be Jew-ish” is indeed quite the dodge.\n\nSantos had also claimed that he lost four employees in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. That wasn’t true, either, althoughhe now saysit was four prospective employees; still, he didn’t provide any names or other details.\n\nSantos even seems to have lied about hischarity work. He claims to have founded the group Friends of Pets United, an animal rescue organization that was not registered as a charity in New York or New Jersey. According to New York Times reporting, the IRS has no record of it. The purported beneficiary of one $50-a-head fundraiser for Friends of Pets United says that she never received the money raised, according to the Times as well. Now, Santos is less clear about his work,sayinghe helped out the charity and found homes for the animals.\n\nOne claim that Santos flat-out denied was a finding from the Times that he was charged with fraud in Brazil after writing stolen checks.According to the New York Times, “In the court file, Mr. Santos is identified by his full name and date of birth, as well as by the names of his mother and father. The documents show that Mr. Santos confessed to the crime and was charged, but that the case remains unresolved because authorities were later unable to locate him.”\n\n“I am not a criminal here — not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world,”Santos told the Post. “Absolutely not.

The attacker was shot dead.\n\nIt is not clear when the staff suspensions were formally issued, and US media reports differ on whether or not they have already been served.\n\nThe staff were given penalties ranging from 10 to 42 days of leave without pay or benefits, the agency said.\n\n\"Secret Service is totally accountable for Butler,\" Matt Quinn, the service's deputy director, told the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"Butler was an operational failure and we are focused today on ensuring that it never happens again.\"\n\nQuinn, who was appointed to his role in May this year, added that he was \"laser-focused on fixing the root cause of the problem\", but the organisation would not \"fire our way out of this\".\n\nHe told CBS a number of improvements had already been made, involving military-grade drones and improved mobile command posts that could now be used by agents in the field.\n\nThe identities of the suspended staff and their roles on the day of the attack have not been disclosed.\n\nAmong the reforms the Secret Service said it has implemented are \"clear lines\" of accountability, improved information sharing with local law enforcement partners and the creation of an Aviation and Airspace Security division that is \"dedicated to maintaining the agency's critical aerial monitoring capabilities\".\n\nIn excerpts of a Fox News interview that will air on Saturday, Trump said that the US Secret Service \"had a bad day\" in Butler, but is \"satisfied\" with the investigation into the shooting.\n\n\"There were mistakes made. And that shouldn't have happened,\" Trump said in the interview.\n\nThe news comes just days before the anniversary of the attack on 13 July 2024. Rally attendee Corey Comperatore was killed and two other people injured.\n\nThe incident prompted the resignation of the service's then-director, Kimberly Cheatle.\n\nThe Secret Service has been under intense scrutiny for the last 12 months, and has faced sharp criticism from the US Congress.\n\nLast September, a 94-page Senate report found that security failures and lack of communication within the US Secret Service \"directly contributed\" to the incident, and that many issues remained unaddressed two months later.\n\nThe attack was also described as preventable in another report, published in December, by a House of Representatives taskforce. That paper identified the main lapse as being a failure to secure the rooftop from which Crooks opened fire.\n\nTrump, who was successfully re-elected in November, was provided with heightened security in the aftermath of the attack - ensuring that he received protection at a level above what is typical for a presidential candidate.\n\nIn September, he was again rushed to safety by Secret Service agents after a second would-be gunman lurked in bushes at Trump's golf course in Florida. The FBI described this, too, as an apparent assassination attempt.\n\nThe suspect in that second incident was detained.\n\nThe actor remembered the primatologist as “gentle, curious, funny, and absolutely unstoppable.\"\n\nA strong geomagnetic storm made the northern lights visible across much of the country.\n\nPresident Herzog's office says he holds Trump \"in the highest regard\", but that anyone seeking a pardon has to submit a formal request.\n\nEven if the budget swiftly clears Congress, it will still take days to reopen the government.\n\nThe spending plan may have passed the Senate, but it's not yet a done deal in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read moreopinionarticles on CNN.\n\nOn August 29, a USdrone strike killed 10 members of one familyin Kabul. That same day, the Pentagon announced that the operation successfully targeted a suicide bomber affiliated with ISIS-K, who had allegedly filled a car with explosives as part of a suspected plan to attack the Hamid Karzai International Airport, where US troops raced to complete their evacuation operation a day before their deadline.\n\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, had previously called the attack a“righteous strike,”days aftertwo bombing attacksoutside the airport killed13 US service members and more than 160 Afghan civilians. ISIS-K, the ISIS branch that rivals the Taliban in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility.\n\nBut last week, Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of US Central Command, which oversaw the drone attack, presented the results of an investigation into the operation that revealed that it had not targeted ISIS-K operatives but instead killed Afghan civilians, including seven children. “It was a mistake and I offer my sincere apology,”he stated.\n\nThe admission and apology were stunning, especially as the unmanned drone strike was among the last US military actions with troops still on the ground in Afghanistan, bringing a 20-year military presence in the country to a painful end.\n\nRelated articleOpinion: What's really behind the 'Justice for J6' rally\n\nYet, beyond the specifics of this attack, the case provides insight into the inevitable problems of an emerging new form of warfare that has dominated US efforts in the latter years of the post-9/11 conflicts. The anti-ISIS campaign in Iraq and Syria and the last seven years of US actions in Afghanistan haverelied heavily on air attacks with precision munitionsmanaged from a distance and with minimal,on-the-ground US military presence.\n\nGen. McKenzie’s remarksreviewed the secretive processes through which drone operations are managed, revealing the extraordinary military capacity of the US as well as the difficulty of meeting the stated goals of only targeting combatants and avoiding civilian casualties.\n\nGen. McKenzie explained that following the ISIS-K deadly attack on the Kabul airport, the military received multiple intelligence reports about how the group would use a white Toyota Corolla, one of the most common cars in the Afghan capital, in an upcoming operation. As many as six MQ-9 Reaper drones were surveilling the area and noticed a car of this type near a site believed to be used by ISIS-K,according to Gen. McKenzie. For eight hours, US military and intelligence watched live feeds of the car, its driver and others as they moved from one place to another, loading things in and out of the vehicle.\n\nRelated articleBiden is not living up to his promises\n\nIn the afternoon, as the car was parked by a building in an area where ISIS-K was operating, a man “assessed at the time to be a co-conspirator” approached and the drone attacked. Gen. McKenzieexplainedthat the strike team held off on authorizing the attack until the car was stationary to avoid civilian casualties on the street, and that the weaponeering team had adjusted the fuse of the Hellfire missile so that it would detonate inside the vehicle to further minimize civilian harm.\n\nWhen the strike produced an additional explosion, this was viewed as evidence that it had correctly targeted a vehicle filled with explosives in preparation for an attack.\n\nGen. McKenzie’s point was that the mistaken targeting of the vehicle, while unfortunate and tragic, was justified given the pressures of protecting US forces at the airport and the significant evidence gathered and reviewed by teams of military and intelligence professionals.\n\nYet, how could the situation have gone so spectacularly wrong? How could this level of extraordinary technical capacity have misread each piece of evidence as proof that the car was driven by an ISIS-K operative when, in fact, it was involved in the daily operations of aUS-based humanitarian organization?\n\nRelated articleHe's on the FBI's most-wanted list and is now a key member of the Taliban's new government\n\nThere is no singular answer to these questions, but what is clear from this case, as well as evidence of similar issues from other US air strikes, is that it is often very difficult to assess a situation with limited on-the-ground verification, leading to devastating consequences.\n\nDespite the failure of the August 29 attack, Gen. McKenzie explained that the event in no way raised concerns about the capacity of the US military to effectively conduct future strikes. Hediscussed other operationsaround the same time, including an attack that killed key ISIS-K operatives in Nangarhar.\n\nGen.

Kemp has already declared victory in the race and resigned his secretary of state position to prepare for the transition.\n\nIn a56-page ruling, Totenberg also called for the office to provide a hotline or website for provisional ballot voters to find out why or if they were rejected. The judge ordered all 159 of the state's counties to publicize the availability of the hotlines on their websites.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitutionreports:\n\nThe court decision comes as votes are still being counted in the race for governor between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. Abrams trails Kemp and would need to gain more than 20,000 additional votes to force a runoff election.\n\nTotenberg said she’s providing \"limited, modest\" relief to help protect voters. The order preserves Tuesday’s deadline for county election offices to certify results and the Nov. 20 deadline for Secretary of State Robyn Crittenden tocertifythe election. The ruling enjoins Crittenden from certifying the election before Friday at 5 p.m.\n\nHer ruling applies toprovisional ballots, which were issued to as many as 27,000 Georgia voters because their registration or identification couldn’t be verified. Provisional ballots are usually only counted if voters prove their eligibility within three days of the election, a deadline that passed Friday.\n\nCommon Cause Georgia filed the lawsuit and celebrated the ruling, calling it a victory for voting rights. The order did not change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify results, NBC News reported.\n\nThe Abrams campaign hasfiled a separate lawsuitcalling for the certification deadline to be pushed back to Wednesday, as well as calling for the counting of rejected provisional ballots that were turned down for minor mistakes, such as an incorrect date or mismatched signature.\n\nA federal judge just issued a 56 page order that could affect thousands of provisional ballots in Georgia's race for governor.#gapol\n\n— Greg Bluestein (@bluestein)November 13, 2018\n\nThe order by Judge Amy Totenberg blocks the Secretary of State from certifying the election until Friday and directs state and local officials to conduct a review of many of the provisional ballots.#gapol\n\n— Greg Bluestein (@bluestein)November 13, 2018\n\nThe state also has to provide new, rolling updates of why provisional ballots were rejected and to set up a hotline for voters so they can determine whether their provisional ballots were counted.#gapol\n\n— Greg Bluestein (@bluestein)November 13, 2018\n\nKemp has repeatedly called on Abrams to concede, but she has refused.

Over the weekend, the Georgia secretary of state office said there were 21,190, while Abrams' campaign aides estimated there were more than 26,000 votes yet to be counted.\n\nAs more Georgia counties certify their voting results, Abrams still trails by nearly 60,000 votes and needs tonetmore than 20,000 votes of whatever remains uncounted to get Kemp below the 50-percent threshold.\n\nA few hundred more votes just came in and the margin in the race for governor remains the same.@staceyabramsstill needs to net 20k+ votes to force a runoff.

The latest raise brings the Fed’s overnight target to a range of 2.0 to 2.25 percent. This is the first time since before the financial crisis that the Fed’s target has been above 2 percent. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates again in December.\n\nThe Fed’s policy of gradually raising rates has attracted the ire of President Donald Trump, who has said he disagrees with the policy but has no plans to interfere with the independence of the central bank. Trump has complained that raising interest rates works against his efforts to grow the economy at a faster clip.\n\n“I don’t like all this work that we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,” Trump said in July. “I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”\n\nHe also tweeted his disapproval:\n\nTrump’s criticism of the Fedharkenedback to the Reagan era, when Ronald Reagan and his aides were frequently at odds with then-Fed chairman Paul Volcker. Some of Reagan’s supporters even wanted Volcker impeached because they believed his tight monetary policy was choking off the economy and undermining administration’s tax cuts.\n\nThe Fed’s statement describes U.S. economic conditions as “strong” a number of times.\n\n“Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly,” the Fed said.\n\nIn addition to its formal statement, the Fed released the economic projections of the members of its Federal Open Markets Committee.

His ceasefire proposal got a thumbs up Monday from the U.N. Security Council, with only Russia abstaining\n\nNetanyahu has said that Biden presented only parts of the proposal and insisted that any talk of a permanent ceasefire before dismantling Hamas' military and governing capabilities is a nonstarter.\n\nBlinken's trip comes at a particularly tumultuous time politically for Netanyahu, as Benny Gantz, a centrist member ofIsrael's war cabinet, quit the government Sunday.\n\nOn his way out the door, Gantz accused Netanyahu of mismanaging the war and putting his 'political survival' over the country's security.\n\nGantz had previously said he would leave the government by June 8 if Netanyahu did not provide a new plan for how to deal with post-warGaza.\n\nWith Gantz's departure, Netanyahu is now more reliant on far-right allies in the Israeli parliament, who have threatened to collapse his government if he implements a proposed ceasefire deal that would see hostages released if Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza.\n\nWith no firm public response yet from Hamas or Israel to the proposal they received 10 days ago, Blinken started his eighth visit to the region since the conflict began in October by meeting with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt, a key mediator with the militant Hamas group.\n\nBlinken once again called on Hamas to accept the plan, which he said has wide international support.\n\n'If you want a ceasefire, press Hamas to say \"yes,\" he told reporters before leaving Cairo on the trip that will take him to Israel, Jordan and Qatar.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken (left) met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) Monday in Jerusalem as leaders try to iron out an Israel-Hamas hostage deal\n\nIn a handout photo Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken (left) is seen greeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right)\n\nBlinken said Israel has accepted the proposal, though Netanyahu has not said so directly.\n\n'I know that there are those who are pessimistic about the prospects,' Blinken said, putting the onus squarely on Hamas.

You’re waiting for it to happen, as if you want to make your words become a reality.”\n\nThomas-Greenfield responded by telling Nebenzya, “Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops on your border.”\n\nCalling the massive Russian force along ots western border “a threat to peace and security,” Thomas-Greenfield told the 15-member council that it had been created precisely to address Moscow’s menacing behavior.\n\n“Our charge is not only to address conflicts after they occur, but also to prevent them from happening in the first place,” she said. “This is why today’s meeting is so crucial.”\n\nNebenzya​ repeated Russian government denials that it has any intention of attacking Ukraine and blamed the US ​for escalating the crisis.\n\n“Our Western colleagues are talking the need for de-escalation. However, first and foremost, they themselves are whipping up tensions and rhetoric and are provoking escalation,” he said. “The discussions about a threat of war is provocative in and of itself.”\n\nRussia and China tried and failed to keep matters behind closed doors by opposing a motion to hold an open meeting. The motion passed 10-2, with the US, the UK and France — the other three permanent members of the Security Council — being joined by Albania, Brazil, Ghana, Ireland, Mexico, Norway and the United Arab Emirates. Gabon, India and Kenya abstained.\n\nDuring debate, T​homas-Greenfield said Russian President Vladimir Putin had organized “the largest mobilization of troops in Europe in decades” while “attempting, without any factual basis, to paint Ukraine and Western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack.”\n\nAlong with more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders, Russia has deployed more than 5,000 military personnel in Belarus with ​short-range ballistic missiles, special forces and anti-aircraft batteries​ — ​and has ramped up cyberattacks in Ukraine to spread disinformation through state-owned media and its proxies.\n\nThomas-Greenfield called on her fellow diplomats to rise up and meet Russia’s threats.\n\n“If Russia further invades Ukraine, none of us will be able to say we didn’t see it coming. And the consequences will be horrific,” she said.\n\nNebenzya suggested that the US estimate of Russian troop figures had been fabricated.​\n\n“​Where did you get the figure of 100,000 troops that are deployed, as you state, on the Russian-Ukrainian border, although that is not the case?” he asked. “We have never cited that figure. We’ve never confirmed that figure.”\n\nThe Russian also blamed the US for the 2014 ouster of Kremlin-friendly Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, saying it brought to power “nationalists, radicals, Russophobes and pure Nazis,” and created the current antagonism between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“If they hadn’t done this, then we to date would be living in a spirit of good neighborly relations and mutual cooperation,” Nebenzya said. “However, some in the West just don’t clearly like this positive scenario. What’s happening today is yet another attempt to drive a wedge between Russia and Ukraine.”\n\nAt another point, Nebenzya pointedly left the council chamber as Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya started to speak.\n\n“How long Russia will pressure, will pursue a clear attempt to push Ukraine and its partners into a Kafka trap?” Kyslytsva asked.\n\nAs the meeting was in progress, theWhite Houseissued a statement ​urging Russia to continue to engage in diplomatic talks before warning that Moscow would face “swift andsevere consequences” if it attacks.\n\n“Today’s Security Council meeting is a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice: rejecting the use of force, calling for military de-escalation, supporting diplomacy as the best path forward, and demanding accountability from every member state to refrain from military aggression against its neighbors,” President Biden said.\n\nEfforts to find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis are ongoing, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to phone his Russian counterpart, ​Sergey Lavrov, on Tuesday.\n\nDiscussions between Blinken and Lavrov in Geneva earlier this month overPutin’s demandsthat Ukraine and other former Soviet satellites be barred from joining NATO failed to reach any breakthroughs.\n\nWith Post wires​\n\nAdvertisement"}

By Saturday, the offer was, according to the district, a cumulative 23% raise, starting with 2% retroactive as of the 2020-21 school year and ending with 5% in 2024-25. The package also includes a one-time 3% bonus for those who have worked since 2020-21, along with expanded hours, more full-time positions and improved eligibility for healthcare.\n\nThe district estimates the cost of expanding health benefits at about $20,000 per year per employee.\n\nUnion Executive Director Max Arias said a primary goal of the union has been to raise the average annual wage of members from $25,000 to $36,000.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThey drive buses, clean bathrooms and care for children who are disabled.

You’re supporting the classroom aide that helps you with that unruly student.”\n\n“We’re teachers,” he added. “We don’t put up with injustice; we promote supporting our fellow people.”\n\nUTLA also is negotiating a contract and had lengthy bargaining sessions on Friday and Saturday.\n\nArias characterized the Monday interchange with the district as a part of the mediation and fact-finding process overseen by the state labor regulators.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)\n\nA new Tennessee law with the unassuming acronym “PEACE” might appear, on the surface, to be a mundane update to the state’s criminal code. But tucked into the legislation’s language is a clear and deliberate threat to the First Amendment freedoms of Tennesseans.\n\nOnFriday, Gov. Bill Lee signedSenate Bill 30, the Protecting Everyone Against Crime and Extremism Act (PEACE Act).The law makes it a criminal offense to leave “unsolicited flyers” on public or private property, hang signs from overpasses and bridges, ride in the back of a box truck, refuse to give one’s name or give a false name to law enforcement, and approach within 25 feet of an officer after being ordered to stop or retreat.\n\nWhile these provisions might sound like routine penalties for littering, limits on approaching police officers and tweaks to law enforcement powers, they raise serious First Amendment concerns.\n\nOne of the most troubling aspects of the law is its expansion of the state’s intimidation law to criminalize acts like handing out flyers or trespassing if done with the “intent to intimidate” someone from exercising their rights. This language is dangerously vague, and that’s exactly the problem. “Intent to intimidate” is not clearly defined and can easily be used to target protestors, demonstrators, or anyone expressing dissent in a way that makes someone uncomfortable.\n\nBill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback\n\nAdditionally, the law classifies dropping “unsolicited flyers” on private or public property as “littering,” which means a political pamphlet left on a doorstep could potentially lead to a criminal charge. The Supreme Court has long held that leafleting is protected speech, not trash. InLovell v. City of Griffin(1938),Schneider v. State(1939),Talley v California(1960) andWatchtower v. Village of Stratton(2002), the Court affirmed that the right to distribute printed material, especially for political or religious purposes, lies at the heart of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Tennessee law’s new provisions also prohibit approaching within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer after being ordered to stop. Although the amended version narrows this to active crime scenes, traffic stops, or public safety threats, it still violates the public’s right to record and monitor police conduct in public spaces. Federal courts have increasingly recognized this right as an essential check on government power. InGlik v. Cunniffe(2011), the First Circuit wrote that “[t]he filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public place… fits comfortably” within the principles of protected First Amendment expression.\n\nAs if these aspects of the law were not concerning enough, it also grants police broader authority to arrest individuals for misdemeanors not committed in their presence and provides legal immunity to officers who decide later not to issue citations for these alleged offenses. In combination with the new criminal categories for expressive conduct, this gives law enforcement a wide berth to intimidate and arrest peaceful demonstrators, especially in politically charged settings.\n\nLegal advocateshave trackedsimilar efforts around the country where these minor offenses are not used against litterers and loiters but asa means to shut down protests. This would give the government wider latitude to target speech that the party in power doesn’t like, from climate activists to pro-life protestors to labor union strikes.\n\nSupporters of this law may argue that these provisions promote public order or protect communities from hate. But the First Amendment does not allow the government to punish speech simply because it is offensive or hateful. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that even the most disturbing or bigoted speech is protected unless it is intended and likely to provoke imminent lawless action, amounts to a true threat, or defamation.\n\nLaws that target speech based on the speaker’s motive or viewpoint and give broad discretion to law enforcement violate fundamental constitutional principles. The PEACE Act presents significant risks of overreach and is likely to face constitutional challenges in court.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: New Cdc Covid 19 Quarantine Guidance Welcomed Some Criticized Others", "output": "The most interesting public-health development of the pandemic era came this week with a radicalcourse revision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe policy change has COVID hawks trembling with fear and rage and bafflement — while those who believe we need to find a way to move on from top-down regulatory measures are very confused by the possibility the CDC just became an ally rather than an enemy.\n\nSimply put, the CDC appears to have decided that there’s justtoo much COVID around nowto continue its previously draconian efforts to contain it through forced human separation.\n\nIts new guidance says people who test positive for COVIDcan end their isolation(or quarantine or whatever is the word of the week to explain how to stay away from people) after five days rather than 10 if they’re asymptomatic. They don’t need to test their way out.\n\nHow could this be, when we’re in the middle of the biggest surge in COVID cases since the pandemic’s start? The surgeisthe reason.\n\nOmicron is moving so fast and is structured in such a way that it eludes containment — and given its speed, pursuing such containment would require measures that would make the lockdowns of spring 2020 look like Times Square during the ball drop.\n\nWhat’s key here is the implicit acknowledgment thatOmicron is far less damaging than its predecessor, the Delta variant. And the danger recedes the more vaccine you’ve gotten.\n\nAs of today, two-thirds of the population of the United States over the age of 5 is considered fully vaccinated. So it isn’t a hard choice to make — balancing the danger of breakthrough cases that are very likely to be mild against the threat to the public’s economic and psychic well-being that would result from severe lockdowns.\n\nOnce such choices were harder. But that was before the vaccines.\n\nAs we bring the horrendous year of 2021 to an end, every unvaccinated person in America has made a conscious and long-standing choice to risk it (or had that choice made for them by their parents). The guidance implicitly says the CDC will no longer intervene on their behalf, especially since they don’t want the intervention.\n\nAnd what about children under 5, who cannot get vaccinated? Even COVID hawks like Dr. Paul Offit are not seeing an increase in the threat level: “We test anybody who’s admitted to the hospital for whatever reason . . . and we’re definitely seeing an increase in cases. However, we’re really not seeing an increase in children who are hospitalized for COVID or in the intensive care unit for COVID.”\n\nBecause we have vaccines to save us from the worst of COVID, because we’re weeks away from apill that will treat COVIDand because Omicron is both more contagious and less harmful, there is no longer any case to be made for avoidance as a public-policy approach.\n\nThis has proved displeasing to many. Virologist Angie Rasmussen, who has more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, declared: “Can’t believe I’m saying this but on this one, ignore the CDC.” She went on with an implicit accusation that the agency had changed its guidelines in order to please . . . Delta Airlines.\n\nI guess it’s fine for theCDC to have its guidance directed by teachers unionsbut not by the needs of the larger American economy. Remember that the American economy is not some abstract thing. It’s the ecosystem in which we live, and we are going to live with the consequences of having disrupted it the way we did for at least a decade.\n\nWe don’t really understand how this happened this way, but it’s an acknowledgment of new realities and new possibilities — and the first time since the pandemic began that the public-health panjandra seem to be grappling with the real-world costs of their top-down dictates. That is to be welcomed by all.\n\njpodhoretz@gmail.com"}

We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized. While we don’t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people,” Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement.\n\nCNN filed the federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday demanding that the White House restore the press credential of star reporter Jim Acosta. The administration suspended Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which provided expedited access to the White House grounds, after he broke protocol by refusing to surrender his microphone during a press conference last week.\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a scathing statement, calling the move “more grandstanding from CNN” and pointing out that the network has other reporters who are still allowed to enter the White House.\n\n\"This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,” Sanders said. “CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions — each of which the President answered — he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.”\n\nAcosta's press pass to access the White House was suspended \"until further notice\" after he engaged in the contentious back-and-forth last week over the migrant caravan working its way up through Mexico. Trump characterizes the caravan as \"an invasion,\" a term to which Acosta objected.\n\n“Honestly, I think you should let me run the country and you run CNN,” the president said.\n\nAcosta attempted to ask Trump another question before a female White House aide walked over to him. The CNN reporter continued to try to talk as the aide was seen trying to take the microphone from his hand. She grabbed the microphone but Acosta wouldn't give it up and there was brief contact between the two. Later in the day, Acosta’s credential was revoked.\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association – of which Fox News is a member – issued a statement in support of CNN's decision to take legal action.\n\n“We continue to urge the administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN’s correspondent,” WHCA President Olivier Knox said. “The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.”\n\nHowever, several prominent media members – such as Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist Bob Woodward – have criticized CNN over the lawsuit.\n\nAcosta has emerged as a hero of the #Resistance after making a habit of shouting and interrupting when Trump and members of his administration are available to the media. Acosta has also gotten into combative arguments with other members of the administration, including former Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.\n\nGet a daily look at the top news in music, movies, television and more in the entertainment industry.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Biden and the West Virginia senator will meet Wednesday afternoon to work on their differences. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nPresident Joe Biden is trying to break a logjam with Republicans on how to pay for infrastructure improvements, proposing a 15% minimum tax on corporations and the possibility of revenues from increased IRS enforcement as a possible compromise.\n\nThe offer was made Wednesday to Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia as part of the bipartisan negotiations and did not reflect a change in Biden’s overall vision for funding infrastructure.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden examined possible tax code changes from his plans that Republicans might support. The president concluded that a minimum corporate tax could provide some common ground.\n\n“He looked to see what could be a path forward with his Republican colleagues on this specific negotiation,” Psaki told reporters at a Thursday briefing. “This is a component of what he’s proposed for a pay-for that he’s lifting up as a question as to whether they could agree to that.”\n\nBiden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% to help fund his plans for roads, bridges, electric vehicles and broadband internet, and that remains one of his preferred approaches. But the rate hike is a nonstarter with Republicans because it would undo the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump.\n\nBy floating an alternative — there is no minimum corporate tax now on profits — Biden was trying to give Republicans a way to back infrastructure without violating their own red line of keeping corporate tax rates at their current level. The Washington Post first reported the offer.\n\nOn Thursday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he spoke with Capito after the session and is “still hoping” to reach a deal with the administration. But he prefers the GOP approach that is eyeing a scaled-down package, paid for by tapping unspent COVID-19 relief funds, rather than taxes.\n\n“Let’s reach an agreement on infrastructure that’s smaller but still significant, and fully paid for,” he said in Paducah, Kentucky.\n\nThe president is essentially staking out the principle that profitable corporations should pay income taxes. Many companies can avoid taxes or minimize their bills through a series of credits, deductions and other ways of structuring their income and expenses.\n\nThe president has insisted that the middle class should not bear the cost of greater infrastructure spending. Yet a chasm exists in negotiations because Republicans say that corporate tax increases will hinder economic growth.\n\nThe idea of imposing a minimum corporate tax is not new for Biden, who proposed the policy during the presidential campaign last year, and that could turn off some Republicans. The center-rightTax Foundationestimated that a minimum tax would subtract 0.21% from long-run U.S. gross domestic product.\n\n“He’s been pushing it since the primaries over a year ago,” said George Callas, managing director of government affairs for the law firm Steptoe and a former tax counsel to House Republicans. Callas said that the minimum tax would mostly hit firms such as electric utilities and telecoms that make substantial capital investments as well as companies that rely on paying their employees with stock.\n\nAt the same time, both Democrats and Republicans have eyedrevenues that could come from stepped-up IRS enforcement of unpaid taxes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has suggested it could amount to some $1 trillion, but others say the estimate is far lower.\n\nBiden is seeking roughly $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, down from an initial pitch of $2.3 trillion. Republicans, so far, have countered with only $257 billion in additional spending on infrastructure as part of a $928 billion package. The GOP’s new spending on infrastructure would be a fraction of what the president says is necessary to compete globally and boost economic growth.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during a Thursday visit to ..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Perspectives Fbi Doj Probe Threats Against School Officials", "output": "The administration has mobilized the FBI against parents who oppose critical race theory.\n\nIn an official memo, Attorney General Merrick Garland has pledged to mobilize the FBI against parents protesting critical race theory in public schools, citing unspecified “threats of violence” against school officials.\n\nGarland’s memo follows a National School Boards Association request that the Biden administration investigate threats to school board members and classify sometimes-heated parent protests as “domestic terrorism.” The NSBA suggested that some of these parents should be prosecuted under the PATRIOT Act and federal hate-crimes legislation.\n\nFinally, a reason to check your email.\n\nSign up for ourfree newslettertoday.\n\nThe school board association letter, however, is riddled with falsehoods, errors, and exaggerations. It begins with the claim that “critical race theory is not taught in public schools,” despite a vast body of evidence, including myown reporting, showing that the teaching of CRT is widespread in public schools. Even the national teachers’ union has admitted as much andcalledfor CRT’s implementation in all 50 states.\n\nThe NSBA deliberately misrepresents debates at school board meetings as “threats” and sometimes-vociferous and angry speech as “violence.” The letter refers to dozens of news stories alluding to “disruptions,” “shouts,” “argument,” and “mobs,” but, contrary to its core claim, cites only a single example of actual violence against a school official: acaseof aggravated battery in Illinois, which is obviously condemnable, but hardly the justification for a national “domestic terrorism” investigation.\n\nThe association even fabricated entire storylines to support its political objectives. For example, the NSBA claims that a Tennessee school board official named Jon White resigned due to “threats and acts of violence”; the linkedsource, however, reports that White resigned for “concerns about too much time away from his family,” with no mention of threats or violence. (In another localreport, White complains about parents calling him a “child abuser” and other epithets, which, while harsh, are hardly the equivalent of an “act of violence.”)\n\nStill, despite the school board association’s flimsy pretext, the Biden administration appears to be doing its bidding. Garland’s memo instructs the FBI to coordinate with “federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement” to develop plans to “discourage these threats, identify them when they occur, and prosecute them when appropriate.” NSBA directorChip Slavenand national teachers’ unionpresidentRandi Weingarten immediately praised Garland’s aggressive actions.\n\nThis is a deeply politicized and dangerous escalation in the debate about critical race theory in public schools. For months, critical race theory proponents, including teachers’ unions, have struggled to respond to critics, and new surveydatashow that strong majorities among all racial categories oppose teaching CRT in public schools. But as its standing in polls has plummeted, the education establishment has turned to more heavy-handed tactics.\n\nThe purpose of mobilizing the FBI is not only to monitor dissent but also to subdue it. The suggestion that parents might be engaging in “domestic terrorism” is designed to suppress speech and assembly and to justify further federalization of education policy. In congressional testimony last week, Education Secretary Miguel Cardonarefused to saythat parents are the “primary stakeholders” in their children’s education; this week, Attorney General Garland is attempting to drive an even bigger wedge between parents and public schools.\n\nParents should not let this overreach deter them from speaking out against critical race theory in schools. The Biden administration has raised the stakes, and the fight is no longer only about CRT; it is also about protecting the basic rights of free speech, assembly, and constituent control over the nation’s public institutions. The grassroots revolt against critical race theory is proof that Americans still have the instinct for self-rule. They must not let the Biden administration crush it.\n\nChristopher F.

The capital recorded 19 new local cases on Sunday, bringing the total in the city since April 22 to 60, according to national health data released Monday morning.\n\n“The city has recently seen several outbreaks involving multiple transmission chains, and the risk of continued and undetected transmission is high. The situation is urgent and grim,” municipal official Tian Wei told reporters Saturday. “The whole city must act immediately.”\n\nRelated videoChina 'causing doubt' over Shanghai's reporting of Covid death count\n\nThe pressure to contain the outbreak in the capital comes as cases continue to grow in Shanghai, despite a failed weeks-long lockdown that has brought the financial hub to a halt.The city reported more than 19,000 new cases and 51 deaths on Sunday, according to official figures released Monday morning.\n\nThe daily death count marks a record high since city officials first reported fatalities in the city’s ongoing outbreak last Monday, though questions have been raised about whether the numbers account for all fatalities.\n\nIn Beijing, authorities mobilized to curb transmission, placing several residential communities in Chaoyang under “control management,” according to state media, using a term that typically means residents are barred from leaving the area while they undergo testing. A district official on Sunday warned that disruptions to business and work were inevitable in the course of fighting the outbreak.\n\nScreening would be upped in tour groups in the city, after cases were detected among a group of mainly elderly tourists who were now under quarantine, officials said on Saturday. At least one village in a suburban district of Beijing linked to a positive case was also closed down as mass testing was carried out.\n\nThe rush to contain the outbreak comes as fears grow across China that more stringent measures could be in store as the country sticks with a stringent “zero-Covid” policy to eliminate the spread of the virus in each outbreak.\n\nRelated video'The city completely lost its shine': Expats vent about Shanghai's strict Covid measures\n\nThat policy has faced its most stark challenge since March 1 as the highly transmissible Omicron variant sparked several simultaneous outbreaks.

Rep. Steve Scalise, second in command of the House Republicans, said that he and his colleagues support spending more to overcome the pandemic, but that the Democratic plan is chock full of unneeded giveaways.\n\n\"There's over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous relief bills that were bipartisan,\" Scalise, R-La.,said Feb. 21on ABC’s This Week. \"The money's still sitting in a bank account and we're going to pass $1.9 trillion of additional spending to bail out failed states, to raise the minimum wage?

Scalise led with the same argument ina Feb. 19 op-ed.\n\nHis source is theCOVID Money Tracker, a project of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group focused on reducing federal deficits. The tracker’s latest number shows that out of $4.1 trillion approved by Congress, about $3 trillion has been committed or disbursed.\n\nBut in aJan. 27 blog post, the budget group warned that figuring out how much money remains is complicated. It’s not, they wrote, as though the money is \"sitting in budget accounts waiting to be allocated.\"\n\n\"Much of it is already allocated or scheduled to be spent, and a small portion will never be spent,\" they wrote.\n\nA large fraction of the nominally unspent money comes from theResponse and Relief Act, passed in late December.\n\n\"These funds will take some time to disburse and even more time to appear in the data,\" they said.\n\nAbout a fifth of the money that Scalise counted will be spent over several years, primarily in the form of Medicaid dollars and a lending program called Economic Injury and Disaster Loans.\n\nPart of the uncertainty, the committee’s analysts wrote, is that some of the money allocated in earlier bills might never be spent. For example, theCARES Actthat passed in March extended unemployment benefits at anestimated cost of $250 billion. But as of right now, that seems to overshoot the need, they said. The amount of the excess would make Scalise’s $1 trillion number a bit lower.\n\nSetting aside the December relief package, about 80% of previously allocated funds have been spent, they said.\n\nThe federal government has its ownCOVID-19 relief spending tracker. It counts dollars differently than the one Scalise used, and it hasn’t been updated since the end of December. By its accounting, out of a total of $2.4 trillion that Congress approved, about $500 billion remains unspent and unobligated.\n\nIf federal dollars go unspent, that might suggest that certain programs need to be redesigned. Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings, a Washington research group, said it could be that the way Congress set up a program made it too hard for the money to get to the people and businesses that needed help.\n\nThat, however, is a separate question from the size of the relief bill.\n\n\"Ultimately, it may be the case that unspent funds mean that the next package should be smaller, but I don’t think that’s the first conclusion one should necessarily draw from any existence of unspent funds,\" Reynolds said.\n\nEven money that Washington has disbursed can be held up at the state level. Massachusetts has spent about half of the $2.7 billion it got through the CARES Act, theBoston Globereported.Missouri officialsleft about $13 million for small farms and businesses unused.\n\nScalise said, \"There's over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous relief bills ... still sitting in a bank account.\"\n\nScalise’s point-in-time figure is in line with one running tally, but he oversimplified the status of the funds. A large share of the total is already allocated or scheduled to be spent. A key factor is that Washington is getting up to speed in disbursing funds approved in late December.\n\nThe money is not sitting in budget accounts, but neither has it reached its final destination..\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n\nThe Principles of the Truth-O-Meter\n\nABC News,This Week, Feb. 21, 2021\n\nWashington Post,We already went ‘big’ on coronavirus relief.

This may seem an absurd or alarmist statement, since we have been conditioned by unparallelled growth to expect that there are no catastrophes that are insurmountable. Even apocalyptic science fiction deals with bands of survivors who have, by definition, survived. And we always imagine ourselves as among the survivors.\n\nBut the threat is real.The latest reportof the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us that there are only a dozen or so years in which to change our economies radically if we are to keep the effects of the warming already under way to manageable proportions. That would require the countries of the world tolive up to the most ambitious of the goalsof the Paris climate change agreement, and keep the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. A rise of even half a degree above that, to 2C, will have effects that are very much worse. Already this seems much more likely. All corals will disappear, as will many insects and plants.\n\nThe disappearance of plants, and in particular the deforestation of tropical regions, is doubly dangerous, because it converts carbon sinks (which living trees are, because they absorb carbon dioxide) into producers of carbon. That is only one of the manypossible tipping pointswhich may lead to a sudden and violent escalation of the rate of change as malign feedback loops are formed.\n\nAll these risks make it quite credible that we will end with a warming of 3C, 4C or even worse – and the consequences will be globally terrible, and everywhere unavoidable. Hundreds of millions of people may die through droughts on land, and flooding at the coasts, through the loss of marine species due to acidification of the oceans, and probably through the disruption of long-term weather patterns around which the world’s agriculture has been shaped. These victims will notpassively await their fates. Among the tipping points that we cannot foresee in any detail is the prospect of historically unprecedented refugee migrations as whole populations who have no choice but to starve or move set out for land where they can live. The political and indeed the military consequences are unlikely to be small.\n\nNone of this will only be the product of vast impersonal forces, any more than our present crisis is. There are always political and economic choices that explain our actions.A recent studyidentified 90 different organisations, ranging from states to private companies, that were between them responsible for nearly two-thirds of carbon emissions since 1864. They all behaved as rational, profit-seeking actors without any external responsibilities, and so brought us to the brink of catastrophe. This kind of twisted rationality exacerbates the dangerous physical effects of climate change.\n\nThe election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil now seems overwhelmingly likely, and he is committed, like Donald Trump, to withdrawing his country from the Paris accords. His policies in the Amazon basin will greatly accelerate deforestation. In Australia, the government ofScott Morrisonmust deal with the reality of climate change in the form of droughts and wildfires, but is at the same time denying any responsibility for the effects of its own actions when they worsen the situation.\n\nThis kind of short-term selfishness can’t be overcome only by appeals to unselfishness or to solidarity. Only long-term self-interest can be stronger: perhaps the fear that international anarchy must ultimately lead to international war in an age of nuclear and biological weapons.\n\nIt is not the direct effects of climate change alone but their indirect effects on the political and economic structures of the world that make it a genuinely existential threat. As individuals in the rich world, we should all eat less meat and use less fossil-fuel energy. Butindividual actionwill never be enough. We must also work to strengthen the kind of political structures that will enable, and if needed compel, the cooperation that is the only alternative to destructive anarchy."}

But whether Trump would sign it is another matter altogether.\n\nTrump has grown impatient and his demands on his U.S.-Mexico border wall. He tweeted Wednesday morning, hours before the negotiators were to sit down for their first meeting, that the group of Republicans and Democrats is \"Wasting their time!\" if they aren't \"discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier.\"\n\nDemocrats, who hold the House, remain united against Trump's vision for a massive wall project, yet some are signaling a willingness to deal in the wake of the 35-day partial government shutdown.\n\n\"We've consistently said that we do not support a medieval border wall from sea to shining sea,\" said Rep. Hakim Jeffries of New York, the No. 4 House Democrat. \"However, we are able to support fencing where is makes sense, but it should be done in an evidence-based fashion.\"\n\n\"We've come to big agreements before,\" said the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York. Schumer said that \"when the president stays out of the negotiations we almost always succeed. When he mixes in, it's a formula for failure. So, I'd ask President Trump, 'Let Congress deal with it on its own.'\"\n\nFor their part, GOP leaders want to de-escalate the battle over the border wall and suggest they too could be flexible as bargainers, who hold their first session Wednesday, seek a bipartisan agreement.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who pressured Trump last week to end the shutdown, warned the president against triggering another shutdown or declaring a national emergency on the Southwest boundary, a move that could let him redirect budget funds to building segments of the wall.\n\nWhen asked to describe a border security agreement he'd support, McConnell said, \"I'm for whatever works that would prevent the level of dysfunction we've seen on full display here the last month and also doesn't bring about a view on the president's part that he needs to declare a national emergency.\"\n\nA fresh, protracted crisis could make it difficult to tackle other upcoming business such as a deal to prevent automatic budget cuts to the Pentagon and domestic agencies.\n\nThe longest shutdown ever was initiated by Trump after Democrats refused his demand for $5.7 billion to build segments of his border wall. Polls show people chiefly blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown and widely dislike the wall.\n\nThe president surrendered last Friday and agreed to reopen government for three weeks so negotiators can seek a border security deal, but with no commitments for wall funds.\n\nTrump has retreated increasingly from the word \"wall\" as it became apparent that he lacked the votes in Congress to win taxpayer financing for the project, which he initially said would be financed by Mexico.\n\n\"Inside the meetings we've had, he's said it could be a barrier, it could be a wall,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \"Because what a barrier does, it's still the same thing. It's the 30-foot steel slat, that's a barrier.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, McCarthy reiterated that \"wall\" is not as important as what it's intended to do.\n\n\"I'm looking for safety and security over semantics,\" McCarthy told \"Fox & Friends.\" ''I don't care what they call it, but it has to be a barrier. It has to protect.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp said: \"The president has perfectly set this table for the negotiations with Congress. He wants to give Congress one more chance.\"\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly said they wouldn't finance the wall, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has called \"immoral.\" In recent weeks, they've expressed support for fencing or physical barriers but have left ambiguous exactly what they would back. They've said they want to spend money on more border patrol agents and technology like scanning devices and drones.\n\n\"What we aren't going to do is use taxpayer money to fund a political applause line,\" said Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass.\n\nMcConnell and many GOP lawmakers have long sought to avoid government shutdowns, aware of the tactic's long and consistent history of backfiring badly on whoever sparks one. In the one that just ended, 800,000 federal workers went unpaid for five weeks, countless Americans were denied federal services and mushrooming problems included slowed air travel and delayed IRS refunds.\n\nMembers of both parties have opposed Trump declaring an emergency on the Mexican border. They say it would set a dangerous precedent for future presidents who might use the strategy to push agendas that stall in Congress. If Trump issued the declaration, it ..."}

The Taliban swept into Kabul, facing little resistance.Wakil Kohsar/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\n\nA U.S. military helicopter is pictured flying above the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Sunday. The Taliban swept into Kabul, facing little resistance.\n\nTwenty years after being removed from power in a U.S.-led invasion, Taliban militiamen swept into Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, on Sunday, facing little resistance from Afghan government forces.\n\nWithin hours, Afghanistan's Washington-backed president had left the country and the flag at the U.S. Embassy had been lowered amid a hasty evacuation of diplomatic personnel.\n\nAshraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president, said on Facebook that his was \"a hard choice,\" but that he decided to leave to prevent bloodshed. He signed off hispostwith \"Long Live Afghanistan.\" The Talibanreleased a statementsaying they had entered the capital of 6 million people and were working to restore law and order.\n\nOn Saturday, the militia's fighters took the last remaining government stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, followed quickly on Sunday by the city of Jalalabad, which lies just east of Kabul on a major road artery.\n\nBy Sunday, Kabul was a scene eerily reminiscent of the fall of Saigon in 1975 in the wake of the Vietnam War, as helicopters circled the U.S. embassy as its diplomatic personnel were under evacuation orders. The comparison to Vietnam was one that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was keen to dismiss: \"This is not Saigon. We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission, and that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11 and we succeeded in that mission,\" he told CNN'sState of the Union.\n\nIn analerton Sunday, the U.S. embassy cautioned of reports that Kabul's airport was \"taking fire\" and that \"we are instructing U.S. citizens to shelter in place.\" A U.S. military official told NPR the airport was closed to commercial aircraft as military evacuations continue.\n\nEarlier, the White House had orderedabout 5,000 troops to be sentto Afghanistan to provide security and assist in evacuations of U.S. personnel. The Pentagon confirmed on Sunday another 1,000 would head there as well.\n\nThe day's events were a dramatic coda to America's longest war, prompted by the Taliban's refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Within weeks of the attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., U.S.-led forces invaded the country, toppling the Taliban by year's end.\n\nBut that involvement stretched from months into years. Since then, more than 2,400 U.S. service members, some 3,800 American contractors, more than 1,100 other allied service members, and an estimated 66,000 Afghan national military and police have lost their lives due to the conflict, along with more than 47,000 civilians, according toBrown University's Costs of War Project.\n\nUltimately, the U.S. price tag for two decades in Afghanistan runs as high as$2.26 trillion,including the cost of rebuilding the Afghan government and training its military.\n\nBlinken on Sunday sounded a note of bitterness over the rapid collapse of the 300,000-strong U.S.-trained Afghan security forces, which \"proved incapable of defending the country\" — an eventuality that \"did happen more rapidly than we anticipated,\" he acknowledged.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by the former NATO supreme allied commander, Ret. Adm. James Stavridis: \"You can buy all the equipment in the world, but you can't purchase leadership or political will or in particular, battlefield will,\" Stavridis toldNPR'sWeekend Edition. \"And therefore, we see this ghosting of the Afghan army. It's quite heartbreaking.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the ground in Kabul, chaos and fear were the order of the day as the Taliban — with their well-deserved reputation for repression and brutality, particularly toward women and ethnic and religious minorities — began taking charge.\n\nPeople line up outside Azizi Bank to take out cash as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul on Sunday.Haroon Sabawoon/Anadolu Agency via Getty Imageshide caption\n\nPeople line up outside Azizi Bank to take out cash as the Taliban close in on the capital Kabul on Sunday.\n\nMany Afghans waited in long lines at banks to withdraw money, concerned about what might happen to their savings under a new regime.\n\nOne resident, who NPR is not identifying to protect from possible reprisals,described chaos in the capital.\n\n\"Right now, the thieves, robbers, all the looters are out and trying to loot cars — whichever are traveling right now,\" the woman said. \"[There are] gunshots everywhere.\"\n\nShe added: \"In [our neighborhood] we have this guard with a gun and he also just shot at someone because people are trying to loot houses and whomever is passing by the road.\"\n\nStill others in the capital appeared to welcome their new rulers.\n\nMatthieu Aikins, a freelance journalist in..."}

The silence of the apartment was pierced by the unfamiliar buzzing of a pager lying near a table.\n\nAnnoyed but curious, the 21-year-old picked up the device belonging to a family member. She saw a message: “Error,” then “Press OK.”\n\nJaffal didn’t have time to respond. She didn’t even hear the explosion.\n\nJaffal said.\n\n“I felt I was in a whirlpool.” She was in and out of consciousness for hours, blood streaming from her mouth, excruciating pain in her fingertips.\n\nAt that moment on Sept. 17, 2024,thousands of pagersdistributed to theHezbollahgroup were blowing up in homes, offices, shops and on frontlines across Lebanon, remotelydetonated by Israel.Hezbollah had been firing rockets into Israel almost daily for nearly a year in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nAfter years of planning, Israel had infiltrated the supply chain of Hezbollah, the most powerful of Iran’s armed proxies in the Middle East. It used shell companies to sell the rigged devices to commercial associates of Hezbollah in an operation aimed at disrupting the Iran-backed group’s communication networks andharming and disorienting its members.\n\nThe pager attack was stunning in its scope. It wounded more than 3,000 people and killed 12, including two children.\n\nIsrael boasts of it as a show of its technological and intelligence prowess. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently presented U.S. President Donald Trump with a golden pager as a gift.\n\nHuman rights and United Nations reports, however, say the attack may have violated international law, calling it indiscriminate.\n\nHezbollah, also a major Shiite political party with a wide network of social institutions, has acknowledged that most of those wounded and killed were its fighters or personnel. The simultaneous explosions in populated areas, however, also wounded many civilians like Jaffal, who was one of four women along with 71 men who received medical treatment in Iran. Hezbollah won't say how many civilians were hurt, but says most were relatives of the group's personnel or workers in Hezbollah-linked institutions, including hospitals.\n\nTen months later, survivors are on a slow, painful path to recovery. They are easily identifiable, with missing eyes, faces laced with scars, hands with missing fingers — signs of the moment when they checked the buzzing devices. The scars also mark them as a likely Hezbollah member or a dependent.\n\nFor weeks after the attack, The Associated Press attempted to reach survivors, who stayed out of the public eye. Many spent weeks outside Lebanon for medical treatment. Most in the group’s tight-knit community remained quiet while Hezbollah investigated the massive security breach.\n\nThe AP also contacted Hezbollah and its association treating those affected by the attacks to see if they could facilitate contacts. The group, at war with Israel for decades, is also one of the most powerful political factions in Lebanon, with members holding nearly 10% of parliament seats and two ministerial posts. It has its own security apparatus and offers extensive health, religious and other social and commercial services in southern and eastern Lebanon and parts of Beirut.\n\nA representative of Hezbollah’s Association of Wounded did share with AP the contacts of eight people who had expressed readiness to share their stories. The AP independently contacted them, and six agreed to be interviewed. They included Jaffal and another woman, two 12-year-old children and two men, one a preacher, the other a fighter.\n\nAll are Hezbollah officials or fighters or members of their families. All lost fingers. Shrapnel lodged under their skin. The men were blinded. The women and children each lost one eye, with the other damaged.\n\nThere were no minders present, and no questions were off-limits. Some declined to answer questions about the identity or role of the pager’s owner, identifying them only as relatives.\n\nThe hours of interviews offered a rare glimpse into the attack's human toll. Survivors described how the incessantly buzzing pagers exploded when picked up, whether they pressed a button or not. Some said their ears still ring from the blast.\n\n”I’ve put up with so much pain I never imagined I could tolerate,” said Jaffal, a university graduate.\n\nThe survivors expressed ongoing support for Hezbollah but acknowledged the security breach. They blamed Israel for their wounds.\n\nRights groups have argued the attack was indiscriminate because the pagers detonated in populated areas, and it was nearly impossible to know who was holding the devices or where they were when they exploded.

The outbreak, first detected in the United Kingdom in mid-May, has now seen more than 26,000 cases recorded by more than 80 countries around the globe. More than 6,600 of those cases have been recorded in the U.S.\n\nYour daily dose of news in health and medicine.\n\nThe declaration of a domestic public health emergency gives the administration more flexibility and powers with which to try to halt spread of the virus. The powers could, among other things, allow the administration to tap into additional federal funds for the response.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt will also give the issue higher profile in the medical community across the country, said Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who applauded the decision.\n\n“This is a strong attempt to try to elevate the message higher than it has been,” said Inglesby, who noted many health professionals have not seen monkeypox cases and may remain unclear about how to test for it. “People need to be looking for it, familiar with it, and be testing for it.”\n\nAlso Thursday, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf announced the agency was considering allowing Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos, the only vaccine licensed in the United States to prevent monkeypox, to be given in two doses that are one-fifth the size of the licensed doses, via intradermal administration. Doing so could allow five times as many people to be vaccinated with existing supplies than if the licensed dosage was employed.\n\nThe vaccine is licensed as a two-dose product, with the doses administered via subcutaneous injection 28 days apart.\n\n“We believe this could be a promising approach,” Califf said.\n\nAn additional federal declaration that allows the FDA to fast-track drugs and vaccines during emergencies would be needed before the agency could greenlight this approach. Califf suggested this might be coming within days.The agency would also need to field a request — either from Bavarian Nordic or another federal government agency — to issue an emergency use authorization for fractional dosing of the vaccine, the FDA said in an email.\n\nThe federal government financed development of Jynneos and owns the lion’s share of the available doses in the world. But much of the available product is still in bulk form and must be put through what is called fill and finish to package it in vials for delivery. Both domestically and internationally, doses are in short supply.\n\nIntradermal vaccination involves slipping a smaller-than-normal needle under the top layer of the skin to deposit the vaccine. The skin is rich with antigen-presenting cells that can activate a strong immune response and earlier studies have shown vaccines can be used in lower doses if administered this way. But this technique is not commonly used and will require training for people who are going to administer the vaccine. It may also result in short-term discomfort for people who receive the vaccine, with more itching, redness, and swelling at the injection site.\n\nA studyconducted about a decade ago and published in 2015 in the journal Vaccine showed that a one-fifth dose of this vaccine delivered by intradermal injection can trigger an immune response similar to that of two standard doses injected under the skin. The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases is in thefinal stagesof planning a similar study, comparing the immune response to standard doses to those generated by a fractional, intradermally administered regimen as well as to the response to a single dose of the vaccine. Whether that will proceed is now in question.\n\nEarlier this week, the administration announced the appointment of a White House monkeypox coordinator, Robert Fenton from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that,” CNN President Jeff Zucker said.\n\nOthers pointed out that neither party has a monopoly on civility and that leftists have been routinely confronting Republican officials in public with hostility and threats.\n\n“We’ve seen calls for incivility from both sides of the political spectrum,” former FBI and CIA official Jeff Beatty said on CNN. “If people are keeping score at home, so far the only people who have had blood spilled are the Republicans.”\n\nHe was referring to members of the House Republicans’ baseball team, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was shot during practice in June 2017.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump calls on voters to ‘settle our disagreements … peacefully at the ballot box’\n\n“I have experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and am committed to using my voice to speak out against it wherever I can,” said Mr. Scalise, who almost died from his wounds.\n\nReferring to the pipe bombs, Mr. Scalise tweeted, “These attempted attacks that have been made are beyond criminal, they are acts of pure terror. Violence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society.”\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Trump called for civility and said federal authorities had started a major investigation.\n\n“In these times, we have to unify,” Mr. Trump said. “We have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.”\n\nTeam Clinton wasn’t buying it. Former Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines tweeted at the president, “This is on you.”\n\n“With every fiber of your rotten being you’ve incited & condoned hate,” Mr. Reines posted. “Never in 643 days have you discouraged people from unleashing the violence inside them. Your very existence requires anger & fear. You need it like normal people need oxygen.”\n\nSEE ALSO: White House says Trump not to blame for pipe bomber\n\nMrs. Clinton said the president and Republicans don’t deserve civility from Democrats.\n\n“You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,” Mrs. Clinton said two weeks ago. “That’s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that’s when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.”\n\nMs. Waters, California Democrat, called on Americans to “absolutely harass” Trump administration officials in public last summer in the wake of a furor over the separation of illegal migrant families at the Mexican border.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that they “listened with great interest” as Mr. Trump called for unity and condemned the bombings — but they added that those words aren’t good enough.\n\n“President Trump’s words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence,” the two Democratic leaders said in a joint statement.\n\n“Time and time again, the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions: expressing support for the congressman who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protesters, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people,” they said.\n\nCNN host Chris Cuomo, brother of New York Gov.

Where do you think that language came from?\n\n“Nobody ever said that to me pre-Trump,” Mr. Cuomo said. “The ugliness and the invective that comes out of the White House, and specifically from the president, matters.

There are other reasons, there are other pressures that could have led somebody to want to do something like this. But it matters.

It also gives Health Secretary Xavier Becerra significant flexibility to bend federal rules or waive requirements on government health programs like Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n\"We're prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus,\" Becerra said on a media call Thursday. \"And we urge every American to take the process seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this.\"\n\nA public health emergency declaration lasts for 90 days, but it may be extended by Becerra.

Carolyn B.

The rash may be painful and have lesions that look like pimples or blisters that can occur on the face and other parts of the body.\n\nThere have been no deaths due to monkeypox reported in the U.S. However, in recent days, several countries that have not historically reported monkeypox cases, including Brazil and Spain, have confirmed deaths due to the virus, according to The Associated Press.\n\nPeople are typically infectedby close person-to-person contact, including intimate contact. It is possible for the disease to also spread through droplets from face-to-face contact with an infected person, or through droplets on linens, sheets, clothes, and surfaces, when people are close for prolonged periods.\n\nHowever, in the current outbreak, most of the spread has come from coming into prolonged skin-to-skin contact with infected people's lesions or bodily fluids.\n\nBefore the outbreak, most cases occurred in countries where the virus is usually found or endemic -- typically central and western Africa.\n\nAt this time, the majority of cases in the current outbreak have been detected in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.

In the other case, two officers were sued by the estate of a man whom they shot and killed after he appeared to threaten them with a hammer.\n\nThe high court said officers in both cases were entitled to qualified immunity. That doctrine protects officers from lawsuits unless it can be shown that they violated \"clearly established\" rights that a reasonable person would know about.\n\nPolice reform advocates have called for an end to qualified immunity, arguing it insulates officers from accountability for wrongdoing. House progressivespushed to include a provision ending the doctrineas part of bipartisan police reform negotiations. Those effortsdissolved last month.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday first ruled on a case in which police in Union City, California, in 2016 responded to a 911 call alleging Ramon Cortesluna was going to hurt his girlfriend and her two children, who were trapped in another room of her home.\n\nAs police directed Cortesluna to leave the house and approach them with his hands up, an officer shouted, \"he has a knife in his left pocket.\" Cortesluna lowered his hands and was shot with nonlethal beanbag rounds in the stomach and hip. He got down on the ground, at which point officer Daniel Rivas-Villegas \"straddled\" him and \"placed his left knee on the left side of Cortesluna's back,\" the court wrote in its opinion.\n\n\"Rivas-Villegas was in this position for no more than eight seconds before standing up while continuing to hold Cortesluna's arms,\" at which point another officer removed the knife and handcuffed Cortesluna, the court said.\n\nCortesluna sued, arguing Rivas-Villegas used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. A federal district court sided with the officer, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed that decision, ruling that \"existing precedent put [Rivas-Villegas] on notice that his conduct constituted excessive force.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that \"to show a violation of clearly established law, Cortesluna must identify a case that put Rivas-Villegas on notice that his specific conduct was unlawful.\"\n\nHe \"has not done so,\" the court's opinion said, and neither he nor the appeals court \"identified any Supreme Court case that addresses facts like the ones at issue here.\"\n\nThe other case involved a 2016 police incident in which the ex-wife of Dominic Rollice told 911 that her former husband was drunk in her garage and refusing to leave.\n\nThree officers from the Tahlequah, Oklahoma, Police Department showed up: Josh Girdner, Chase Reed and Brandon Vick. They asked to pat Rollice down for weapons, but he refused, and then turned away from the officers and grabbed a hammer from the garage, according to bodycam footage. Rollice grasped the hammer with both hands and raised it to shoulder level, and refused to drop it when officers shouted for him to let go of it.\n\nRollice raised the hammer behind his head and \"took a stance as if he was about to throw the hammer or charge at the officers,\" the ruling said. Girdner and Vick then shot Rollice, killing him.\n\nRollice's estate sued alleging the officers violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. The district court found the use of force was reasonable and that qualified immunity applied.\n\nBut the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals differed, ruling that the officers' moves to corner Rollice in the back of the garage led to the use of deadly force.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed that appellate decision, saying none of the precedent cited by the lower court \"comes close to establishing that the officers' conduct was unlawful\" in this case.\n\n\"We have repeatedly told courts not to define clearly established law at too high a level of generality,\" the high court ruled.\n\nQualified immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,\" according to the opinion, which cited court precedent.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: 2024 Presidential Election Wh Press Sec Labels Biden Videos Cheap Fakes Made Bad Faith", "output": "ByTed Johnson\n\nPolitical Editor\n\nThe White House in the past week has railed against so-called “cheap fakes,” videos edited to look as if PresidentJoe Bidenhas “frozen” or was wandering away at major public events, while media outlets amplifying the moments have done little to add context.\n\nThe videos include one at a D-Day ceremony earlier this month, another at a Juneteenth ceremony last week and still another the G7 summit Thursday. The latest to go viral is a video at the end ofBiden’s star-filled Los Angeles re-election fundraiserover the weekend.\n\nAs the moments have spread beyond RNC Research talking points to right-wing media figures and some mainstream outlets, White House and campaign officials have pushed back at the videos as edited, cropped or missing a larger context.\n\n“They are cheap fake videos, they are done in bad faith, and some of your news organizations have been very clear, have stressed that some of these right wing critics of the president have a credibility problem because fact checkers have repeatedly caught them pushing misinformation,” White House Press SecretaryKarine Jean-Pierresaid Monday.\n\nBiden’s age is an issue in the election — as is Trump’s. For a third cycle in a row, whoever wins in November will be the oldest person elected to the White House. Yet in part because of a stiff gait and a stutter, as wellas some other moments, Biden’s age has been of far greater focus of the mainstream press than his rival.\n\nBut the “cheap fake” videos have gained traction in outlets like theNew York Postand in stories by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which have framed them as if parroted from Trump’s campaign. Biden’s age and acuity has long been the focus of the GOP’s narratives, as way back in 2020, Trump’s campaign was referring to his rival as a “rotting corpse.”\n\nThe cheap fake videos are in contrast to deepfakes, in that they use traditional editing techniques, trimming or cropping away a few moments to tie into a group’s own chosen narrative. Deepfakes, meanwhile, use AI technology to do so.\n\nThe D-Day video showed Biden at the Normandy anniversary ceremony, briefly pausing in the midst of sitting down in a chair on stage. After the RNC blasted out the moment as “awkward,” other social media users seized on the moment as showing the president trying to take his seat in an invisible chair. A story from Sinclair Broadcast Group’s National Desk went out with the headline, “Biden appears to have trouble sitting down during D-Day remembrance event.” The story included the RNC Research X/Twitter post, as the author of the story noted, “Biden’s strange stooping motion caused several terms to trend on X including ‘diaper,’ ‘pooping’ and ‘pooped.’ ”\n\nWhile the Sinclair piece did mention White House spokesperson Andrew Bates’ pushback — he called it “false” and “politically motivated” — the story did not mention or feature a longer version of the video of the moment. That clip was much more unremarkable, as it showed Biden pausing for a couple seconds and he was about to sit down, then taking his seat as an announcer introduced Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.\n\nAwkward 😬pic.twitter.com/3KNLco85hj\n\nHere’s the actual clip of Joe Biden taking his seat at the D-Day ceremony. He pauses for a bit before taking the seat — not an imaginary chair from what I can see.pic.twitter.com/uJo5Ezb8W6\n\nThe Juneteenth video also was flagged by RNC Research and was quickly picked up by media personalities on the right. The video that circulated showed Biden standing still and smiling at the White House’s Juneteenth celebration last week, listening to a performance on the South Lawn as Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and others clapped and swayed to the beat around him. “President Biden appears to freeze at White House Juneteenth event,” read a story on FoxNews.com, which compared it to two occasions when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell froze in front of reporters. At the White House today, Jean-Pierre said, “The President stood there listening to the music and he didn’t dance. Excuse me, I did not know not dancing was a health issue.”\n\n‘NO ONE’S HOME’: President Biden appears to freeze as Vice President Harris and others dance next to him at a Juneteenth event.https://t.co/k0WAJilZ7lpic.twitter.com/cFMRVXDd3y\n\nThe G7 video, also posted by RNC Research, drew millions of views for its claim that it showed Biden wandering off as other world leaders watched a skydiving demonstration. In fact, that video appeared to be cropped. A different, wider angle showed that Biden was speaking and congratulating another skydiver.\n\nWHAT IS BIDEN DOING?pic.twitter.com/iY33K2srII\n\n.@JoeNBC: “They know exactly what they’re doing.

The unemployment rate, meanwhile, edged down to 3.5%, the lowest level since theCOVID-19 pandemicbegan more than two years ago.\n\nThe U.S. has now replaced all the jobs that were lost during the pandemic.\n\nJob gains were broad-based in July, with leisure and hospitality leading the way in hiring, adding 96,000 new workers. That was followed by professional businesses services (89,000), health care (70,000) and government (57,000). Construction contributed 32,000 new jobs while manufacturing added 30,000.\n\nHOW DEMOCRATS' BEEFED-UP IRS COULD HURT LOW-INCOME AMERICANS\n\nThe uptick in hiring comes amid a growing consensus that the economy is losing momentum as theFederal Reserve hikes interest ratesat the fastest pace in decades to wrestle inflation under control. The Commerce Department reported last week that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the nation, shrank 0.6% in the three-month period from April to June. That followed a decline of 1.6% in the first three months of the year.\n\nWith back-to-back quarterly declines in GDP, the economy meets the technical criteria for a recession.\n\nWhile many economists have argued the strong jobs market has so far prevented the U.S. from sliding into a downturn, job growth momentum is expected to cool markedly in coming months as companies cut staff in order to accommodate for lower demand.\n\nJobless claims have started to steadily tick higher in recent weeks and a plethora of companies, including Alphabet's Google, Walmart, Apple, Meta, Robinhood and Microsoft, have announced hiring freezes or layoffs in recent weeks.\n\n\"A powerful increase in July employment—at 528,000, the largest since last December—underscored bedrock support from the labor market, putting the economy on a more gradual trajectory for a recession,\" said Gary Schlossberg, a global strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nDEMOCRATS' MINIMUM CORPORATE TAX WOULD HIT THESE INDUSTRIES THE HARDEST\n\nNow Hiring signs are displayed in front of restaurants in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on March 19, 2022.((Photo by STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) / Getty Images)\n\nThe incredibly tight labor market is in part fueling record-high inflation, as millions of workers are seeing the largest pay gains in years – the result of companies competing with one another for a limited number of employees.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices held the vote Friday, a day after the FDA expanded emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines to authorize a booster shot for certain immunocompromised patients.\n\nThe vote was 11 to 0.\n\nThe recommendation will now go before CDC Director Dr.Rochelle Walenskyfor final approval.\n\nFDA GREENLIGHTS COVID-19 BOOSTER VACCINE FOR SOME IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS\n\nCommittee members were tasked with discussing the following question:\n\nShould vaccination with an additional dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (≥12 years) or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (≥18 years) be recommended following a primary series in immunocompromised people, under an Emergency Use Authorization?\n\nThe panel met on Friday to discuss clinical recommendations regarding an additional dose for immunocompromised individuals. Growing evidence had suggested select immunocompromised patients mount a diminished protective immune response, even after two doses of vaccine.

The S&P 500, which is a basket containing 500 of the biggestU.S. companies, was down 21.3% after open on Monday from its most recent high at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index has already been in bear market territory for quite a while. It is now down more than 31% from the start of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has not yet entered into a bear market, although it was down about 2.5% on Monday and 16.3% since the start of the year.\n\nCONSUMER SENTIMENT PLUNGES TO RECORD LOW AS INFLATION ACCELERATES\n\nThe last bear market was a short period of time at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the last time the economy experienced a prolonged bear market was during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, which lasted for 517 days.\n\nThe market rout accelerated on Friday after the pace ofinflationquickened to 8.6% for the 12 months ending in May, according to the consumer price index. Most economic forecasters had predicted that inflation would stay about the same as the previous month, so the upward tick caused a wave of anxiety among investors who fear the Federal Reserve is well behind the curve in battling the higher prices.\n\nU.S. inflation is now the worst it has been since 1981, when the Great Inflation helped bring President Ronald Reagan to office.\n\nAlso on Friday, the economy got even more bad news when consumer sentimentsunk to record lowsas consumers fret over inflation and what is to come.\n\nThe University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index plunged to 50.2 in June, down from 58.4 in May, according to preliminary numbers.\n\nThe economic uncertainty is also captured by the VIX. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, better known as the VIX, is intended to gauge fear in the markets. The index was up more than 27% in the past five days alone, an enormous jump that illustrates the anxiety investors have about inflation and the potential for economic stagnation. It is up 101% since the start of the year.\n\nThis week, the Fed is set to hike interest rates for the third time in four months. Its first rate hike was a quarter-percentage-point increase in March, followed by a more aggressive half-percentage-point hike last month. The Fed is expected to conduct another half-point hike, especially given Friday’s hotter-than-expected inflation reading.\n\nStill, monetary tightening has a far greater influence on the demand side of the equation but does little to combat inflation caused by the supply side.War in Ukraineis roiling energy supplies, and China’s strict coronavirus lockdown policies are exacerbating supply-side problems.\n\nWhile raising rates depresses demand and should cause the rate of inflation to decrease, it also slows spending. There is concern that the Fed’s more aggressive course of action will knock the economy into a recession.\n\nIn an even worse scenario, the central bank could push the economy into a recession while inflation is still high — something calledstagflation.\n\nStagflation, a portmanteau of stagnation and inflation, is when inflation is rising at the same time that economic growth and the labor market are slowing. The term is typically used to describe the economy of the 1970s, when both inflation and unemployment were high. At the time, many top economists thought such a situation was impossible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe World Bank said last week that, in some respects, the current economic environmentresembles the stagflationary periodduring the 1970s in that inflation is being fueled by major supply chain disruptions and that global economic growth appears to be weakening.\n\n“The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,” said World Bank President David Malpass.\n\nNotifications"}

Ciaramella|6.11.2024 1:19 PM\n\nViolent crime in the U.S. dropped by a significant amount in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the FBI'sQuarterly Uniform Crime Report.\n\nThe FBI data, which is collected from participating police departments across the country, shows that overall violent crime decreased by 15 percent nationally compared to the first quarter of 2023. \"Murder decreased by 26.4 percent, rape decreased by 25.7 percent, robbery decreased by 17.8 percent, and aggravated assault decreased by 12.5 percent,\" the FBIreported. \"Reported property crime also decreased by 15.1 percent.\"\n\nThere are major caveats with the data: It is preliminary and unaudited; police departments will likely report more incidents before it is finalized; and it only quantifies crimes that were reported, leaving out unreported incidents. Bureau of Justice Statistics surveys of crime victimsshowthat fewer than half of violent crimes (excluding murder) and property crimes are reported to the police.\n\nBut it tracks with other early data from 2024. The Major Cities Chiefs Association releasedfirst-quarter datain May, based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments, showing a 17 percent drop in murder.\n\nJeff Asher, a crime analyst,wrotein his Substack yesterday that the FBI's quarterly crime report \"is almost certainly overstating that decline\" but that the general trend would likely hold.\n\n\"Overall, my impression is that the trend direction shown in the FBI data through the first quarter is likely correct but that the overall percent changes are almost certainly overstated by a good bit,\" Asher wrote. \"Violent and property crime are probably not down 15 percent nationally (which would be far and away the largest one year decline ever recorded in both categories), but they are likely down a healthy amount. Murder is down a ton, probably historically so at this point in the year, but probably not 25 percent nationally.\"\n\nThe decline of violent crime is politically significant for the criminal justice reform movement and its opponents. Although crime has been dropping since it spiked in 2020, public perception has gone the opposite direction; in aGallup pollconducted late last year, 63 percent of respondents described the crime problem in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious, the highest percentage since the polling firm began asking the question in 2000.\n\nSeveral Republican-dominated states like Louisiana and Kentucky havepassed sweeping billsto roll back bipartisan criminal justice reforms, citing out-of-control crime, while politicians in blue states like Oregon andCaliforniaare embracing tough-on-crime rhetoric in response to public fears.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, is trying to convince voters that things are getting better.\n\n\"This progress we're seeing is no accident,\" President Joe Biden said in a White House press release. \"My administration is putting more cops on the beat, holding violent criminals accountable, and getting illegal guns off the street—and we are doing it in partnership with communities. As a result, Americans are safer today than when I took office.\"\n\nOf course, national crime trends do not bend to White House policies or how many times a president says \"law and order,\" as former President Donald Trump found out.\n\nBut for whatever reason crime is dropping, it's good news for Americans.

Faced with a growing political rebellion after days of economic chaos, the government said early Monday it was abandoning the plan.\n\nThe embattled finance minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, was due to defend the plan in an address to the ruling Conservative Party’s annual conference. “We must stay the course. I am confident our plan is the right one,” he was due to say, according to released advance extracts of the speech.\n\nInstead, he announced the plan was being scrapped in an early morning tweet. \"We get it and we have listened,\" he said, followed by a similar message from Truss.\n\nThe abrupt about-face comes as the Conservatives gather in the central English city of Birmingham for an annual conference, normally a morale boosting event for activists to hear about the party's priorities for the year ahead.\n\nInstead, the party finds itself in embarrassing retreat with a resurgent opposition center-left Labour Party about 20% ahead in opinion polls. With the country already facing a grim winter of soaring energy bills and food prices, critics accused Truss of having misplaced priorities and intensifying the pain for many.\n\nLabour's finance spokesperson Rachel Reevessaid: \"The Tories have destroyed their economic credibility and damaged trust in the British economy.\"\n\nFor some political commentators, the reversal is too little, too late.\n\n\"The damage has been done,\" said Simon Usherwood, a politics professor at the Open University. \"It has still created an image of a government that thought this was a good idea.\"\n\nTruss has long sought to emulate Britain's divisive former leader Margaret Thatcher, who in 1980 famously said \"the lady is not for turning\" in response to opposition to her own economic liberalization plans. Now, as many critics eagerly pointed out, Truss has turned.\n\n\"This just shows it's a government that can be swayed,\" Usherwood said. \"She was fully behind this plan in interviews on Sunday and is now going back on it. The question is whether there is anything she can do to revitalize her project and her brand.\"\n\nEven as Truss defended the policy over the weekend, a growing number of senior lawmakers in her party signaled they would vote against it in the House of Commons.\n\nThe plan to cut taxes for the wealthy was part of a broader \"mini-budget\" announced soon after the new administration took office. Aimed at fueling economic growth, it proposed broader tax and regulation cuts in a 45 billion pounds ($50 billion) package that was unfunded, leaving Britons wondering which already strained public services might be cut to save money.\n\nThe plan to borrow more to fund the tax cuts was roundly rejected as unsound by economists, with the value of the pound plummeting and the cost for the U.K. to borrow on international markets soaring.\n\nThe move earned a rare rebuke from the International Monetary Fund, which urged the government to “re-evaluate” a plan that may fuel already-soaring inflation and increase economic inequality.\n\nThe British central bank, the Bank of England, also intervened with a 65 billion pound ($73 billion) package to stave off market panic.\n\nDespite Monday's reversal, Kwarteng said the government was sticking to its other tax policies, including a cut next year in the basic rate of income tax.\n\nHomeowners and prospective buyers still look set for a rough ride as interest rates are still likely to rise, pushing mortgage rates higher for millions. Banks have already removed dozens of mortgage deals and pushed their monthly fees higher.\n\nLast week Truss suffered a memorablybruising round of interviewswith local radio stations, in which she falteringly attempted to defend the measures.\n\nA BBC Nottingham presenter described the top rate income tax cut as a \"reverse Robin Hood\" policy and asked Truss: “Why don’t you just hold your hands up and say, ‘This is a mess, we got it wrong and we’re going to do something different'?\"\n\nDays later the..."}

Scientists have clashed for years over whether Covid came from an infected animal that transmitted the virus to humans, or whether the pathogen escaped from a lab in Wuhan.\n\nThe effort by Congress to declassify intelligence on the origins of Covid comes after the Energy Department concluded with \"low confidence\" that the virus most likely escaped from a lab in Wuhan as the result of an accident.\n\nThe Energy Department is one of 18 agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community. The department was previously undecided on how the virus emerged.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has also concluded that the pandemic likely started with a lab incident in Wuhan, the agency's director, Christopher Wray,told Fox Newsearlier this month.\n\n\"The FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan,\" Wray told Fox News. \"Here you are talking about a potential leak from a Chinese government-controlled lab.\"\n\n\"I will just make the observation that the Chinese government, it seems to me, has been doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate the work here, the work that we're doing, the work that our U.S. government and close foreign partners are doing. And that's unfortunate for everybody,\" Wray said.\n\nBidenordered the intelligence community in 2021to provide an updated analysis of how the pandemic emerged. The intelligence agencies were divided on how Covid started spreading among humans, though they said a natural original and a lab leak were both plausible.\n\nFour unnamed agencies in that2021 reportreached low-confidence assessments that an infected animal spread the virus to humans. The intelligence community agreed that Covid was not developed as biological weapon, and most agencies assessed that the virus was not genetically engineered.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency and another unnamed agency are undecided about whether virus has a natural origin or came from a lab, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news about the Energy Department's position.\n\n\"Right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question,\" White House national security advisor Jake Sullivantold CNN last week. \"Some elements of the intelligence community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other. A number of them have said they just don't have enough information to be sure.\"\n\nSullivan said that Biden had specifically requested that national labs under the Energy Department participate in the intelligence review of how the pandemic started. He would not confirm or deny reports about the Energy Department's assessment that a lab leak was more likely.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, the former heads of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Institutes of Health, respectively, have maintained that Covid most likely spread from an infected animal to people. Such an animal has not been identified three years after the pandemic began.\n\nHouse Republicans have called on Fauci, Collins, and other former and current health officialsto testify on the origins of the pandemic.\n\nChina has denied that the virus escaped from a lab. Foreign Ministry spokespersonMao Ning pointed to a World Health Organization reportpublished in March 2021 that said a laboratory origin of the pandemic \"was considered to be extremely unlikely.\"\n\nBut the U.S. and 12 other countriessharply criticized the WHO reportbecause the experts who wrote it lacked access to complete, original data and samples.\n\nOn the day the report was published, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said all hypotheses of the pandemic's origin are on the table and further studies are needed.

The bill narrowly cleared a procedural vote on Tuesday.\n\n“Looks like he’s going to have a hard time doing that,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said. “[Congress will] probably wind up with some clean CR. The shorter the better because long CRs really do hurt military readiness.”\n\n2024 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP AND HARRIS FACE OFF IN ABC SHOWDOWN\n\nEven those strongly advocating the inclusion of the SAVE Act see little upside to delaying the passage of a full fiscal year budget for so long, a push that is predicated on GOP hopes former President Donald Trump will retake the White House.\n\n“I love the idea of the SAVE Act being on a CR. I’d prefer it not be six months,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said. “I’m not a big fan of kicking the can that far down the road. I think it’s just a license to not do anything for six months.”\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), who also noted his support for the SAVE Act, saw clear writing on the wall for the lack of support over Johnson’s plan, which seeks to appease some of his most hard-line House members.\n\n“Obviously, it’s not going to make it through the House the way it is right now,” Tuberville said.\n\nGovernment funding runs out midnight Oct. 1, at which point a shutdown will commence without some sort of spending agreement.\n\nSenate Democrats will require at least some buy-in from Republicans, who are fractured over how long current funding levels should be extended, to overcome a filibuster. Democrats and top Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), believe a clean CR without the SAVE Act that runs until Congress returns after the elections in November is the best way to avoid a shutdown and hash out a full budget for fiscal 2025.\n\n“Speaker Johnson has to understand that the image of a shutdown of the government and turmoil in Congress does not help his party in November,” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL). “Ask the people at the Pentagon why they tell us [CRs are] unacceptable. You can’t run a Department of Defense and not waste money with continuing CRs based on last year’s appropriations.”\n\nThe intraparty squabbling and jockeying by both parties for power over the purse strings is a yearly déjà vu tradition for Congress. But this go-around comes with far greater implications at the ballot box in November, prompting a warning from some in the GOP of the optics that could accompany a shutdown.\n\n“Shutdowns always hurt Republicans,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC). “If Chuck Schumer went down to the Senate floor and said, ‘I’m going to shut down the government,’ the public and the press would blame Republicans. It’s just the same way it works. You’ve got to understand that.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is among the Republicans insisting on the inclusion of the SAVE Act, which Democrats say is tantamount to fearmongering because noncitizens are already barred from voting in federal elections. Some centrist Democrats, such as the Senate’s most vulnerable member, Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), support the legislation but only if it’s stripped from government funding.\n\nTrump urged Republicans to shutter the government unless the SAVE Act is attached.\n\n“If Republicans in the House, and Senate, don’t get absolute assurances on Election Security, THEY SHOULD, IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, GO FORWARD WITH A CONTINUING RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET,” he posted on Truth Social. “THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO “STUFF” VOTER REGISTRATIONS WITH ILLEGAL ALIENS. DON’T LET IT HAPPEN – CLOSE IT DOWN!!!”\n\nMcConnell emphasized his disagreement with such a notion.\n\n“A government shutdown is always a bad idea at any time,” he told reporters.\n\nCertain Senate Republicans have found themselves stuck on the fence over the strategy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX), locked in a competitive bid to become the next Senate GOP leader, declined to stake out a position on Johnson’s spending proposal but said the SAVE Act shouldn’t be controversial.\n\n“We know from polling that voter ID is enormously popular on a bipartisan basis. I honestly don’t see what the big deal is,” Cornyn said. “[Johnson] needs to do what he needs to do in the House, and then we’ll fight that battle over here.”\n\nNotifications"}

John Katko of New York, who was one of the 10 House Republicansto vote to impeach Trumpin the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut McCarthy and other top Republicans did not endorse the agreement Katko had reached, which would give McCarthy much of what he’d sought from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, including an even number of Democrats and Republicans and sign-off from both sides for subpoenas.\n\nOn Monday, Minority Whip Steve Scalise said in a statement that GOP leadership would not lobby their members on the legislation. But on Tuesday afternoon, Scalise’s office said in a reversal that leadership was now advocating Republicans to vote against it.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was noncommittal on the commission Tuesday, saying Senate Republicans were “undecided” about the best way forward.\n\nMcCarthy’s opposition to the agreement raises questions about the GOP leader’s role in the events at the Capitol on January 6, as he had a heated phone conversation with Trump as the insurrection was unfolding.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney,the ousted GOP conference chair, said on Sunday that McCarthyshould provide information to the commissionif it is created. Katko on Monday said it would be up to the commission to decide whether to subpoena McCarthy, noting that both sides would have to sign off.\n\nRelated articleOfficer injured in Capitol riot slams 'disgraceful' new attempts to downplay insurrection\n\nIn a statement explaining his opposition, McCarthy accused Pelosi of failing to negotiate in good faith, while saying that the scope of the proposed legislation needed to also look at other episodes of political violence beyond January 6.\n\n“Given the political misdirections that have marred this process, given the now duplicative and potentially counterproductive nature of this effort, and given the Speaker’s shortsighted scope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannot support this legislation,” McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy and other Republicans have argued that any commission should also look at violence involving Antifa and riots that occurred during protests of police brutality last year. Democrats charge that Republicans are simply trying to obfuscate Trump’s role lying about the election being stolen in the lead-up to January 6 attack.\n\nMcCarthy detailed his opposition to the commission during a closed-door GOP meeting Tuesday morning, according to multiple sources who heard his remarks. His comments hewed closely to his written statement.\n\nKatko also defended the commission to his colleagues in the meeting and argued it would be structured like the 9/11 Commission, according to two sources who heard his remarks.\n\nBut McCarthy’s opposition will sway a wide swath of his conference to vote no when the House votes on Wednesday.\n\nThe Republican opposition to the commission comes as several House Republicans have sought to downplay or completely write off the events of January 6. At a hearing last week, one House Republican complained that the Justice Department was charging those who participated in the insurrection and another Republican lawmaker said the deadly riot looked like normal tourists in the Capitol.\n\nRelated articleGohmert downplays January 6 riot in speech from the House floor, falsely claiming 'no evidence' of armed insurrection\n\nWhile GOP opposition won’t sink the measure in the House, it could jeopardize it when it goes to the Senate, where 60 votes would be needed, meaning at least 10 Republicans would have to support it with all 50 members of the Senate Democratic caucus.\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune had predicted Monday thatthe Senate would pass a billto establish a commission probing the January 6 attack “in some form,” and the South Dakota Republican seemed content on focusing mainly on the events that had transpired at the Capitol, splitting with other GOP leaders who want the investigation to dig into left-wing extremism as well.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Thune stepped back from those comments.\n\n“It’s a little more uncertain, I would say now,” said Thune when asked about opposition from McCarthy as well as other members of the Senate GOP leadership tea..."}

Sullivan(1964) and subsequent cases. That doctrine makes it almost impossible for \"public figures\" to successfully sue for libel. Last Saturday,The New York Timesitself stepped forward tocondemnthe proposed legislation as an attack on freedom of speech and of the press. But theTimes' opposition is based on misunderstandings of the bill, the U.S. Constitution, and the history of American libel standards.\n\nTheTimeseditorial opens with a parade of horrors calculated to frighten its readers into opposition to the Florida bill. TheTimespresents three hypothetical Americans: a homeowner who accuses a building official of being \"in the pocket of developers\"; a broadcaster who accuses the U.S. secretary of homeland security of being a \"traitor\" over border policies; and a parent who calls a library board member a \"bigot and homophobe\" for the removal of a gay-themed book. According to theTimes, each of these people could be sued into bankruptcy under the Florida bill.\n\nThis is alarmism. A defamation claim must be based on a false and injurious statement offact. All of theTimes' hypotheticals are statements ofopinion. Statements of opinion—even when extremely negative—are, under ordinary American legal standards, considered privileged and not a proper basis for a defamation suit. The proposed Florida legislation does nothing to alter that sensible and essential principle of free speech, and thus does nothing to forbid the bare-knuckle, obstreperous discourse theTimeshighlights.\n\nTheTimesalso complains that the bill treats derogatory factual claims based on anonymous sources as \"presumptively false\" in defamation cases. To hear theTimestell it, you would think that journalists will be automatically liable for defamation if they have used an anonymous source. This is simply not the case. The presumption of falsity in such a case does not prevent a conscientious and responsible journalist from defeating a libel suit by demonstrating that the reported claim was true, or that there was good reason to think that it was true when it was published.\n\nMore fundamentally, the Gray Lady's editorialists, treatingNew York Times v. Sullivanas a sacred cow, overlook the serious constitutional problems with the doctrine arising from that case and its successors. Those cases hold that \"public figures\" must be held to a different libel standard than that which is applied for ordinary Americans. The latter only have to show that they have been the victims of injurious, defamatory falsehood. Public figures have a much higher legal hurdle to leap. They have to show not only that they were defamed, but also that their defamer acted with \"actual malice\"—that is, that the defamer knew the defamatory statement was false, or at least acted with \"reckless disregard\" for its truth or falsity.\n\nThe problem with thisNew York Timesdoctrine is that its key concepts are not rooted in the text or history of the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and of the press. It says nothing about the standards under which libel suits are to be judged, and certainly draws no distinction between \"public figures\" who have to show \"actual malice\" and other litigants who do not.\n\nIndeed, the original understanding of freedom of speech and of the press was simple. The Founders believed that libel is outside the scope of freedom of speech and of the press, and that suits against libelous claims raise no constitutional problems. Those who drafted and ratified the First Amendment certainly agreed with the modern Supreme Court that vigorous public debate is necessary to a healthy democracy. But they also understood that the freedoms secured by the First Amendment need to be properly limited to make them compatible with other important goods, such as the right to reputation that is protected by libel laws. The Founding-era view of libel as unprotected by the First Amendment persisted through most of American history, and was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as late as the mid-20th century—shortly before the Warren Court used theNew York Timescase to fashion a new and more permissive doctrine and impose it on the nation.\n\nThe Florida bill is not as an attack on freedom of speech and of the press, but an attempt to provide adequate protection for the right of reputation cherished by all citizens. Whether such changes in the law are necessary is up to the people of Florida and their elected representatives. But the debate over this question should be informed by an accurate understanding of the bill and America's constitutional and legal history—not by the fears that theTimes' editorial is calculated to arouse.\n\nCarson Holloway is Washington Fe..."}

(Teachers themselves generally oppose carrying guns in schools,surveys have shown.)\n\nIn response to the Republican-controlled senate passing the bill last week, Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb said his city’s districtwould continue toban teachers from becoming armed. “As mayor of Cleveland, I feel paralyzed and handcuffed by the lack of real comprehensive gun legislation in Congress and the fact that we have a state that doesn’t give me, as mayor, the tools I need to combat the illegal trafficking of guns that plague our city day in and day out,” Bibb said,according toCleveland.com.\n\nAll Democrats in the Ohio legislature voted against the bill in the Senate last week, with two Republicans joining them. “They just wanted to say they were doing something and what they’ve gotten away with is unconscionable,” Democratic state Senator Teresa Fedor, a former fourth grade teacher,toldThe New York Times. “They will have blood on their hands.”\n\nOpposition to the bill included teachers, school board members, and police union representatives, some of whom testified during committee hearings.\n\nThe “woefully inadequate” training requirement, said Robert Meader, the recently retired commander of the Columbus Division of Police, would “cause harmful accidents and potentially even needless deaths.”\n\nCleveland Teachers Union president Shari Obrenski noted the irony in the state legislature approving this move while also essentially telling teachers how to teachvia billsimplicitly targeting critical race theory. “Educators are being told we are not trusted to decide what to teach in the classroom, a job we study for and are licensed to do,”she testifiedlast month, perThe Washington Post. “But we are trusted to have loaded guns around children with far less training than is required to drive a car.”\n\nNevertheless, GOP state Senator Niraj Antani insisted that the bill he voted for is worthwhile. It is “probably the most important thing we have done to prevent a school shooter in Ohio,” he said, according to theTimes.\n\nDeWine signed the bill the same day that another piece of legislation, which nixes the requirement for concealed handgun carriers to obtain a license to do so, went into effect.\n\nWe want to hear it.

After praising the fence for being so \"clean and orderly\", in contrast to the \"chaos\" on the US-Mexican border, he told his viewers: \"It doesn't require a GDP the size of the US, it doesn't require high-tech walls, guns, or surveillance equipment. All it requires is the will to do it.\"\n\nAnd he praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for not allowing \"this nation of 10 million people to be changed forever by people we didn't invite in and who are coming here illegally\".\n\nTo make sure his US viewers understood his message, he contrasted Mr Orban's policies with those of US President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Because the lessons are so obvious, and such a clear refutation to the policies we currently have, and the people who instituted those policies, Hungary and its government have been ruthlessly attacked and unfairly attacked: 'It's authoritarian, they're fascists…' There are many lies being told right now, that may be the greatest of all.\"\n\nCarlson is attending a three-day festival organised by the Matthias Corvinus Collegium (MCC) in Esztergom, the former Hungarian capital and home of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nMCC is an extremely well-funded school for top students, whom Mr Orban's Fidesz government are carefully grooming to become the country's new right-wing elite. Both Carlson and Mr Orban are due to address the crowds from the main stage.\n\nCarlson's visit comes at a useful time for Mr Orban.\n\nAfter 11 years in almost unchallenged power, he faces a fierce battle for re-election in eight months time, against an unusually united opposition, from left to right, which accuses him of hijacking Hungarian democracy and financially favouring his own coterie of oligarchs and loyalists.\n\nMr Orban also stands accused ofusing Pegasus spyware purchased from the Israeli company NSOto tap the phones and mine the personal data of up to 300 independent journalists, lawyers and businessmen not aligned with his Fidesz party.\n\nThe European Commission has suspended the disbursement of post-Covid EU recovery funds, citing insufficient safeguards against corruption. Nordic governments have also suspended payment of funds to NGOs, after failing to reach agreement with the government over who should disburse them.\n\nBut the embattled Hungarian prime minister loves a fight, and Carlson is his latest high-profile ally.\n\nThe pro-government Central European Press and Media Foundation (KESMA), comprising 457 TV and radio stations, online news portals, daily and regional newspapers, have been lavishing praise on Carlson, described as \"the most influential conservative thinker in the United States\", star-status previously allotted only to ex-Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon or Donald Trump himself.\n\n\"The American political elite has become too mediocre and stupid to face the truth,\" Carlson said in an interview with the Hungarian Mandiner weekly.\n\n\"The elite has turned against its own people, and that's not healthy. Simply put, the leadership of the country hates the American people.\"\n\nIn contrast, he praised Mr Orban.\n\n\"He is defending democracy against the unaccountable billionaires, the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and certain western governments. He is fighting for democracy against those forces which would like to bury it.\"\n\nIn his Fox News report, Carlson described the \"polite\" way in which Hungarian police first detained then pushed two Syrian asylum seekers through a gate in the fence, back into Serbia.\n\n\"This practice causes horrible suffering to those trying to seek protection,\" Andras Lederer of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO, told the BBC.\n\n\"It is unlawful, poses serious security risks, and plays into the hands of organised crime.\"\n\nLast month, the European Court of Human Rights found the Hungarian pushbacks unlawful, in a case brought by the Helsinki Committee. According to government figures, building and patrolling the fence has cost more than $1.5bn (£1.1bn) so far.\n\nFor conservative populists in the US, Hungary is more than just a small country in central Europe. It's an example of right-wing politics done right.\n\nViktor Orban's restrictions on press freedoms, his opposition to immigration and unfettered trade, his outspoken advocacy for \"traditional\" family values and his ethno-nationalist politics that push back against academia and internationalists all fit snugly alongside US Republican Party rhetoric in the Trump era.\n\nThat explains Tucker Carlson's decision to broadcast his popular Fox News talk show from Budapest and his words of praise for Mr Orban, not just for his policies but for defending Western civilisation and being \"hated by the right people\". It's a nod to the provocative brand of politics Mr Trump embraced during his four years in office.\n\nThe Trump ..."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Middle East Israel Greenlights Plan Occupy Gaza City", "output": "ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 769\n\nIsrael was expected Thursday to approve a phased plan to take over vast new areas of the Gaza Strip, potentially over five months, newly displacing around a million Palestinians and despite warnings from top military officials that this would endanger the lives of hostages being held in those areas, according to various Hebrew media reports Wednesday.\n\nThe plan is reportedly aimed at destroying what remains of the Hamas terror group and pressuring it to free the 50 hostages it is still holding, around 20 of them alive, after recent talks for a deal broke down. It would begin with taking over Gaza City, in the north of the Strip, and camps in the central Strip, driving around half of the enclave’s population southward toward the Mawasi humanitarian zone.\n\nDespite a few ministers potentially opposing the plan, multiple reports said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would likely secure a majority within the high-level security cabinet to support the plan when it convenes at 6 p.m. Thursday.\n\nDuring a three-hour security discussion in a smaller group on Tuesday, Netanyahu was presented with several options for continued military operations in the Gaza Strip by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir.\n\nThe Netanyahu-backed plan reportedly focuses initially on seizing Gaza City and expanding aid distribution centers in coordination with the United States.\n\nAccording to Channel 12 news, in the plan’s first phase, Israel would issue an evacuation notice to the residents of Gaza City — estimated to number around 1 million people, roughly half the Strip’s population — to allow time for the establishment of civilian infrastructure in central Gaza, including hospitals and camps for evacuees. This phase is expected to last several weeks.\n\nIsrael would then launch a military offensive in the second phase, during which US President Donald Trump is expected to deliver a speech announcing the acceleration of humanitarian aid in coordination with Israel, the report continued.\n\nUS Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Bloomberg News Wednesday that there was a push to quickly add 12 aid sites to the four currently operated by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\n\n“A quadrupling over two months, if possible. It’s all about funding,” Huckabee said, signaling that this would be coordinated with IDF military advancements: “I think there’s still some question about areas of the north that may depend on whether the IDF can clear those areas and make it safe.”\n\nThe expansion would be funded by approximately $1 billion in donations from the US and other countries, Channel 12 said, adding that the goal would be to enable Gazans to access aid that bypasses Hamas while Gaza City falls under Israeli control.\n\nReports by the Ynet news site, the Kan public broadcaster and Channel 13 news said the military campaign was expected to last between four and five months and involve four to five IDF divisions. Kan reported that in addition to Gaza City in the Strip’s north, the plan was to expand to the camps in central Gaza, where the IDF has barely maneuvered so far.\n\nThe civilian population is expected to be further pushed toward the southern Strip, while maneuvers take place in areas where hostages are believed to be held, with efforts toward avoiding any harm to them.\n\nKan added that mediators Egypt and Qatar were pressuring Israel — via the US — not to implement the plan, while also urging Hamas to resume negotiations.\n\nThe broadcaster cited unnamed security sources as saying the goal was to quickly push more Gazans toward the southern Mawasi zone, in hopes this would serve the stated plan to encourage emigration from Gaza.\n\nThe plan’s goals were also said to include pressuring Hamas to free the remaining hostages. Kan cited an Israeli official, however, as estimating the chances of Hamas returning to the negotiation table before the plan is approved to be “almost zero.”\n\nAccording to Channel 12, another goal is to possibly align with a proposed US-led framework for a comprehensive deal. While Israel may pause operations if that framework advances, officials see it as unlikely, the network said.\n\nBy the end of the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu is expected to seek a mandate to authorize himself and Defense Minister Israel Katz to make operational decisions, including on phased steps.\n\nAn alternative plan on the table, according to Kan, is to encircle Gaza City and the central Gaza camps, block aid to those areas and launch pinpoint raids, rather than full conquest, aiming to wear Hamas down. The downside would be that it would take time, but security officials were cited as saying this could be an initial step before taking over the areas. Netanyahu has reportedly shot down this plan.\n\nAccording to Channel 13, Shas party leader Aryeh Deri is expected to take part in the meeting, and while he and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar are leaning toward opposing the full takeover plan, analysts expect Netanyahu ..."}

Some of the investigation’s prosecutorsmoved to different jobsoutside of Mueller’s office and the office moved some of its cooperators like formernational security adviser Michael Flynntoward sentencing.\n\nThe arrest of former Trump adviser Roger Stone, one of the last key campaign associates in President Donald Trump’s orbit, onFridaywas also a long anticipated move from Mueller.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also will beleaving soonafter attorney general nominee William Barr’s confirmation. Rosenstein previously signaled to other officials that he would leave when he was satisfied that Mueller’s investigation was either complete or close enough to completion that it was protected from potential interference.\n\nBarr’sconfirmation hearingsbegan Jan. 15, meaning that a vote could occur in mid-February at the earliest. An official briefed on the discussions surrounding Rosenstein’s planned departure told CNN that Rosenstein wants to ensure a smooth transition, which includes the Mueller investigation.\n\nBut Mueller has indicated that a grand jury’s work on the probe could continue. The special counsel’s federal grand jury, which began meeting in July 2017, was extended in January so it may continue to meet and vote on criminal indictments for up to six more months.\n\nThe investigation has consistently returned results – thegrand jury has indictedformer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates, their Russian business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, 12 Russian military intelligence officers, 13 Russians and three companies that allegedly manipulated social media to sway US voters.\n\nManafort and Gates have since pleaded guilty to reduced sets of charges, with Mueller alleging in December thatManafort had liedon five major counts since agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel’s office as part of his plea agreement.\n\nFlynn, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have also pleaded guilty to charges from the special counsel’s office.\n\nWhitaker also rattled some Democrats when he said decisions made by Mueller’s office are going to be reviewed by the Department of Justice.\n\n“I am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be reviewed through the various means we have,” Whitaker said.\n\nSome congressional Democrats expressed concern over those comments in interviews with CNN Monday afternoon.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who’s a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that it’s “chilling” to hear Whitaker’s comments.\n\n“I don’t have full confidence that acting Attorney General Whitaker intends to respect the independence of the special counsel and simply support and sustain the decisions he’s made and simply release the report in full,” Coons added.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, “He should not be a censor; it should stand on what Mueller and his group found.”\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who’s another member of that committee, downplayed Whitaker’s comments, saying he takes anything the acting attorney general says with a “giant iceberg worth of salt.”\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said he thinks that Whitaker, or anyone else in the Department of Justice, should not have a say in what’s in Mueller’s report.\n\n“The special counsel should speak for the special counsel’s investigation,” he said.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, had harsh words for Whitaker.\n\n“I’m not thrilled he’s been fully briefed because I don’t think he’s independent or reliable,” Whitehouse said.\n\nHe added that he’s “not convinced” the probe is nearly completed. He said he thinks Whitaker may simply be delivering “administration talking points.”\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

The scenes of pomp and fanfare were a constant throughout the day, which closed with Kim escorting Putin to his plane late in the evening ahead of his trip to Vietnam.\n\nThe staging reflected North Korea’s reliance on Moscow and was likely intended as a reminder to the West that Putin still holds considerable influence in at least some corners of the world, after his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe relationship is important to Russia, too. Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for itsgrinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers.\n\nOn Wednesday Putin gave Kim an Aurus car when the two leaders exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media – the second time Putin has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin’s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Ushakov did not specify what Putin received, but said they were “also good gifts.”\n\nPutin landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday local time, exactly 24 years to the day he was last in Pyongyang, for a visit heralding the countries’ deepening alignment in the face of shared animosity toward the West and international concerns over their growing military cooperation.\n\nIn remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his “full support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,” pointing specifically to Moscow’s war in Ukraine “to protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.”\n\n“Situations continue to be complicated and ever-changing, but I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that we will continue to strengthen and closely engage in strategic communication with the (Russian) leadership,” Kim added.\n\nPutin hailed the countries’ ties as based on “equality and mutual respect,” and said an expected new bilateral agreement would “form the basis of relations between the two states for many years to come,” according to Russian state agency TASS. He also added that he hoped Kim would visit Moscow for their next meeting.\n\nThe burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea’s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang’s heavily sanctioned weapons program.\n\nKim, the third generation leader of a dynasty that has ruled North Korea with an iron fist, beamed visibly as he greeted Putin at the airport in the early hours of Wednesday morning, video footage of the Russian leader’s arrival showed.\n\nThe landmark visit marks a significant boost for Kim, who remains isolated on the world stage and has not hosted another world leader in his capital since the pan..."}

Amy Klobuchar asked of Christopher Wray.\n\nThe Democrat from Minnesotaaskedthe Trump-appointed FBI Director: Did the federal government infiltrate any of the so-called “militia” organizations claimed to be responsible for planning and executing the Capitol Siege?\n\nThe full segment is available onYouTube.\n\nChristopher Wray is able to uncomfortably weasel his way out of answering the question directly, partially because Klobuchar does him the courtesy of not asking him the question directly. Klobuchar instead asks the FBI directorif he wishes he hadinfiltrated the militia organizations allegedly involved in 1/6 — assuming from the outset that there was in fact no infiltration, thereby providing the FBI director an easy way to avoid addressing the question one way or another.\n\nRevolver Newsis willing to address the matter directly in the following three questions:\n\nFrom now on, all discussion of 1/6 must give way to a laser-like focus on the questions above, with an unwavering persistence at obtaining the answers.\n\nIf the narrative about 1/6 does not conform to the questions above, the American people will never learn the most important truth about what 1/6 is, and what kind of country they’re really living in.\n\nIf it turns out the federal government did in fact have undercover agents or confidential informants embedded within the so-called militia groups indicted for conspiring to obstruct the Senate certification on 1/6, the implications would be nothing short of seismic. Especially if such agents or informants enjoyed extremely senior-level positions within such groups.\n\nOne of the key consensus points among the FBI-DOJ and the regime media is the idea that, while 1/6 is primarily the fault of Trump-supporting QAnon-infused “domestic terrorists,” it is secondarily the fault of so-called “intelligence failures.”\n\nKlobuchar’s own question at the March 2, 2021 FBI hearing (above) reinforces this “intelligence failure” narrative, but she is not alone. A five-month “bipartisan” Senate investigation recently arrived at the very same “intelligence failure” narrative to explain the breach of the Capitol and associated events on 1/6:\n\nA bipartisan Senate investigation of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection found security and intelligence failures at every level of government that led to the breach of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob as lawmakers in a joint session were certifying the 2020 election.\n\nThe 95-page report, a product of a roughly five-month, joint probe by the Senate Homeland Security and Rules Committees, found significant breakdowns ranging “from federal intelligence agencies failing to warn of a potential for violence to a lack of planning and preparation by (U.S. Capitol Police) and law enforcement leadership.” There was no overall operational or staffing plan for that fateful day, a total failure of leadership, according to the committees.[ABC News]\n\nIf it turns out that the federal government (FBI, Army Counterintelligence, or a similar agency) had undercover agents or confidential informants embedded in any of the groups involved in 1/6, the “federal intelligence agencies failing to warn of a potential for violence” looks less like an innocent mistake and more like something sinister.\n\nIndeed, if the federal government knew of a potential for violence in or around the Capitol on 1/6 and failed to call for heightened security, the agencies responsible may in fact be legally liable for the damages incurred during that day.\n\nIt is unsettling to entertain the possibility that the federal government knew of a potential for violence on 1/6 and did nothing to stop it. It presents the question: why would agencies, or certain elements within, sit back and let something like this happen on purpose?\n\nA still more disturbing possibility arises from a careful study of the unindicted co-conspirators listed throughout the various charging documents of individuals facing the most serious charges related to 1/6.\n\nWe atRevolver Newshave noticed a pattern from our now months-long investigation into 1/6 — and in particular from our meticulous study of the charging documents related to those indicted. In many cases the unindicted co-conspirators appear to be much more aggressive and egregious participants in the very so-called “conspiracy” serving as the basis for charging those indicted.\n\nThe question immediately arises as to why this is the case, and forces us to consider whether certain individuals are being protected from indictment because they were involved in 1/6 as undercover operatives or confidential informants for a federal agency.\n\nHere it is useful to draw a distinction between two discrete categories of participants ..."}

The Pentagon has used this network, which includes U.S. government-generated news portals and memes, in an effort to shape opinion in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, and beyond.\n\nThe accounts in question started out openly affiliated with the U.S. government. But then the Pentagon appeared to shift tactics and began concealing its affiliation with some of these accounts — a move toward the type of intentional platform manipulation that Twitter has publicly opposed. Though Twitter executives maintained awareness of the accounts, they did not shut them down, but let them remain active for years. Some remain active.\n\nThe revelations are buried in the archives of Twitter’s emails and internal tools, to which The Intercept was granted access for a brief period last week alongside a handful of other writers and reporters. Following Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, the billionaire started giving access to company documents, saying in a Twitter Space that “the general idea is to surface anything bad Twitter has done in the past.” The files, which included records generated under Musk’s ownership, provide unprecedented, if incomplete, insight into decision-making within a major social media company.\n\nTwitter did not provide unfettered access to company information; rather, for three days last week, they allowed me to make requests without restriction that were then fulfilled on my behalf by an attorney, meaning that the search results may not have been exhaustive. I did not agree to any conditions governing the use of the documents, and I made efforts to authenticate and contextualize the documents through further reporting. The redactions in the embedded documents in this story were done by The Intercept to protect privacy, not Twitter.\n\nThe direct assistanceTwitter provided to the Pentagon goes back at least five years.\n\nOn July 26, 2017, Nathaniel Kahler, at the time an official working with U.S. Central Command — also known as CENTCOM, a division of the Defense Department —emaileda Twitter representative with the company’s public policy team, with a request to approve the verification of one account and “whitelist” a list of Arab-language accounts “we use to amplify certain messages.”\n\n“We’ve got some accounts that are not indexing on hashtags — perhaps they were flagged as bots,” wrote Kahler. “A few of these had built a real following and we hope to salvage.” Kahler added that he was happy to provide more paperwork from his office or SOCOM, the acronym for the U.S. Special Operations Command.\n\nTwitter at the time had built out an expanded abuse detection system aimed in part toward flagging malicious activity related to the Islamic State and other terror organizations operating in the Middle East. As an indirect consequence of these efforts, one former Twitter employee explained to The Intercept, accounts controlled by the military that were frequently engaging with extremist groups were being automatically flagged as spam. The former employee, who was involved with the whitelisting of CENTCOM accounts, spoke with The Intercept under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nIn his email, Kahler sent aspreadsheetwith 52 accounts. He asked for priority service for six of the accounts, including@yemencurrent, an account used to broadcast announcements about U.S. drone strikes in Yemen. Around the same time, @yemencurrent, which has since been deleted, had emphasized that U.S. drone strikes were “accurate” and killed terrorists, not civilians, and promoted the U.S. and Saudi-backed assault on Houthi rebels in that country.\n\nOther accounts on the list were focused on promoting U.S.-supported militias in Syria and anti-Iran messages in Iraq.

Still, the commander in chief, during a forceful explanation of his pullout plan, conceded it is “highly unlikely” the Afghan government retains “unified” control of its country.\n\nBiden answered questions from reporters following remarks outlining the newAug. 31withdrawal completion target and said while he doesn’t “trust” the Taliban, he is confident the Afghan government and U.S.-trained security force there will be able to overcome the worse-equipped, smaller Taliban forces. Notably, however, the much larger and much better trained and equipped American and NATO force that has been there since months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks failed to do so in two decades of fighting.\n\nBIDEN ANNOUNCES AFGHANISTAN MISSION WILL END BY AUG. 31, SOONER THAN PLANNED\n\nBiden is taking a risk, both politically and in terms of security. On the former, a clear majority of people in the United States are ready for the country’s longest armed conflict, by far, to end. And on the latter, the Trump administration also had a plan for a complete withdrawal, and Biden is not ruling out sending American forces back in. He told reporters such a decision would be based on whether a civil war there or a Taliban return to power runs contrary to U.S. strategic interests.\n\nThe implication: Should the Taliban fight their way back to running the country, Washington might conclude that is acceptable — so long as it does not harbor extremist groups such as al Qaeda, the Islamic State group, or others that might plot attacks on the U.S., its interests abroad, or close allies.\n\nBut the focus when the president took questions after his prepared remarks was on the possibility that Taliban forces, which have been gaining ground as U.S. forces began to leave, might soon sack the capital.\n\n“No, it is not,” Biden stated when asked about an “inevitable” Taliban takeover. “Because you have the Afghan troops, they’re 300,000 well-equipped, as well equipped as any army in the world, and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable.”\n\nLater in the impromptu press conference, the president rejected reports claiming that U.S. intelligence assessments and top military officials in the country have determined the Taliban will take back power within a year — or sooner.\n\n“That is not true,” Biden answered flatly to a question on the subject. “They did not reach that conclusion.”\n\nHe conceded that the Afghan government still “has to come together” but maintained that “they clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place.”\n\n“The question is, will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it?” Biden continued. “There is not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban. I believe the only way there’s going to be — this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community — the only way there’s only going to be peace and security [in] Afghanistan, is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nYou can watch Biden’s remarks and sometimes-testy Q&A in their entirety below.\n\nNotifications"}

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called on Amazon on Thursday to ensure that all of its hourly workers will receive a boost in compensation after the company drew criticism for slashing stock options and incentive-based pay even as it hiked its minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\n“Our understanding is that the vast majority of Amazon workers are going to see wage increases, including some very significant increases as the minimum wage goes up to $15 an hour,” Sanders said in a statement to FOX Business. “I would hope that as a result of Amazon’s new policy, no worker, especially long-time employees, sees a reduction in total compensation. Amazon can afford to make all workers whole and should do that.”\n\nA noted critic of Amazon’s pay practices,Sanders praisedthe e-commerce giant earlier this week after CEO Jeff Bezos raised the minimum wage to $15 for some 350,000 hourly employees, including seasonal workers. The company also slightly boosted pay for hourly workers already earning $15 per hour.\n\nBut an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to FOX Business on Wednesday that the company isphasing outrestricted stock units, or RSUs, as a form of compensation for customer-service and warehouse employees, at a time when Amazon shares are approaching $2,000. The company is also ending monthly incentive-based pay bonuses for warehouse workers tied to facility production goals.\n\nThe minimum wage increase “more than compensates” employees for the phasing out of stock awards and incentive pay, the company said.\n\n“We can confirm that all hourly Operations and Customer Service employees will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement,” the statement added. “In addition, because it’s no longer incentive-based, the compensation will be more immediate and predictable.”\n\nOver the last several months, Sanders has repeatedly called out Amazon for failing to pay some workers a living wage – a charge the booming brand has long denied.

The jibe, shared largely without context, drew support from prominent conservatives such as right-wing Rep.Marjorie Taylor Greene— whose account wasreinstatedwith Musk's decision to end the platform'sCOVID-19misinformation policy last month, and who has been criticized in the past for her own comments mocking the use of gender pronouns — as well as backlash.\n\nWhile Musk's tweet acquired roughly half a million likes in its first few hours online, health experts like Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist and virology professor, defended Fauci's work at the forefront of U.S. pandemic mitigation efforts and urged Musk to remove the post.\n\n\"For the record: Dr. Fauci has done nothing wrong, except serve our nation.

Shame on you.pic.twitter.com/NbQks9Tohn\n\nAbout an hour before posting the tweet about Fauci, Musk shared amemewith a caption that read in part, \"Just one more lockdown,\" which could be interpreted as an allusion to Fauci's advocacy for safety mandates that public health specialists, including those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agreed were helpful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 before vaccines became widely available.\n\nSince he became one of the leading figures in the fight against the pandemic in early 2020, Fauci was hailed as a hero by some but condemned by others for his recommendations supporting social distancing, the use of face masks and vaccinations to protect against COVID-19. He notably clashed with former President Donald Trump, and Fauci spoke out against rising misinformation and disinformation about mitigation policies and the virus itself. Recalling Trump's false statements about COVID-19 while in office, Fauci said in a new interview withCNNthat he felt he \"had to\" publicly disagree with the then-president despite his discomfort.\n\n\"I have such a great deal of respect for the office of the presidency that it just made me very uncomfortable, but I had to do it... because I couldn't stand there and be complicit in saying hydroxychloroquine works when it doesn't, you know. 'Bleach works.' It doesn't. 'The virus is going to go away like magic.' It's not,\" he said.\n\nIn aninterview with CBS News'Michelle Miller last month, Fauci said he never expected science to become so politicized, making him into \"the boogeyman of the far right.\" He even receiveddeath threatsfor his work.\n\n\"We are living now in an era, I believe, where there is so much distortion of reality, conspiracy theory and untruths,\" he said.\n\nTwitter has undergone a number of changes since Musk purchased the company this fall and pledged to restore \"free speech\" on the platform. His changes involved mass layoffs that cut Twitter staff formerly in charge of content moderation, the reinstatement of accounts that were previously banned for violating Twitter's conduct rules, the release of purported data claiming to reveal the site's \"blacklists,\" which he calls the Twitter Files, and the removal of its COVID misinformation policy.\n\nMusk's takeover has triggered the exits of some celebrities and other large accounts from Twitter, amid accusations that he is empowering far-right actors and as research points to a significant spike in hate speech on the platform, specifically targeting marginalized groups, accordingThe New York Times.\n\n© 2022 CBS Interactive Inc.

The date was chosen because, on January 27, 1945, the infamous Nazi German slave labor and death camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was liberated by the Soviet army.\n\nAmerican Jewish Committee (AJC) CEO David Harris and Muslim World League (MWL) Secretary General Dr. Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa led a groundbreaking joint visit of Muslims and Jews to Auschwitz, the infamous Nazi German death camp, in January 2020.\n\nThe camp, actually it was a complex of camps and work sites, was the destination for more than 1.3 million people arrested, deported, and enslaved by Hitler’s regime. Beyond imagination, an estimated 1.1 million were murdered there, of whom one million were Jews from across Europe and one hundred thousand were primarily Soviet prisoners of war, Polish Catholics, and Roma.\n\nRISE IN ANTISEMITISM, HOLOCAUST DENIAL HAS EU LEADERS WORRIED\n\nAuschwitz-Birkenau was not the only killing site. Other camps included Belzec, Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthausen, Sobibor, and Treblinka. In all, an estimated six million Jews, or two-thirds of European Jewry, were exterminated by Nazi Germany and its collaborators, whether in camps, forced marches, round-ups, or other killing sites, such as Babi Yar, a ravine in the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\n\"Arbeit Macht Frei\" sign at the former Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz  in Oswiecim, Poland. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe Holocaust defies imagination. Its aim was theEndlösung, or Final Solution, of the Jewish people. In pursuit of this goal, a new alphabet of genocide was created — from A for Auschwitz to Z for Zyklon-b, the nerve gas used in the gas chambers.\n\nEvery Jew was a target, including 1.5 million children. The Jews were pursued for one reason— they were Jews and, according to Adolf Hitler’s demented worldview, all Jews had to be eliminated.\n\nA group of child survivors behind a barbed wire fence at the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau in southern Poland, on the day of the camp’s liberation by the Red Army, 27th January 1945. Photo taken by Red Army photographer Captain Alexander Vorontsov during the making of a film about the liberation of the camp. The children were dressed in adult uniforms by the Russians. The children are (left to right): Tomy Schwarz (later Shacham), Miriam Ziegler, Paula Lebovics (front), Ruth Webber, Berta Weinhaber (later Bracha Katz), Erika Winter (later Dohan), Marta Weiss (later Wise), Eva Weiss (later Slonim), Gabor Hirsch (just visible behind Eva Weiss), Gabriel Neumann, Robert Schlesinger (later Shmuel Schelach), Eva Mozes Kor, and Miriam Mozes Zeiger.\n\nSeventy-seven years after the war’s end, why should these events still matter?\n\nFirst, to forget the past is to dishonor the memory of the victims.Those victims don’t even have the dignity of graves. They only have us, and without us who will remember not only their tragic fate, but also the vibrancy of their lives.\n\nSecond, the Holocaust did not emerge from thin air.Rather, it came after centuries of antisemitism — from blood libels to expulsions, from ghettos to inquisitions, from pogroms to forced conversions — on European soil. The longevity, resilience, and lethality of what has been described as the world’s oldest social pathology, antisemitism, should never be underestimated.\n\nIDAHO ANNE FRANK MEMORIAL DEFACED WITH ANTISEMITIC IMAGERY: 'ABHORRENT'\n\nThird, prior to Hitler’s seizure of power in 1933, Germany had experienced 14 years of democracy in a country widely viewed as among the most educated, cultured, and developed.But democracy proved fragile, culture did not stop savagery and education proved no deterrent to brutality. Those sobering lessons mustn’t be forgotten.\n\nMain gate to Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau with train rail in Poland on April 14, 2018.\n\nAnd fourth, appeasement of Nazi Germany, tried by Britain and France in the 1930s, proved a failure.Not only did it not stop the German juggernaut, but instead encouraged it to become even more predatory towards Jews and, more generally, other European nations. As the legendary Winston Churchill said, \"An appeaser is someone who feeds the crocodile, believing they will be eaten last.\"\n\nIn addition to remembrance, what are the other enduring imperatives from this era?\n\n*It is important but insufficient to mourn murdered Jews.Tragically, they cannot be brought back to life. But Jews today, whether in the United States or abroad, face increased Jew-hatred.\n\nHolocaust an..."}

Here's what it means\n\nPutinannounced a partial mobilizationon Wednesday that is expected to include the call-up of up to 300,000 reservists. He has for months resisted taking that step and Biden administration officials said Wednesday that the fact he has moved to do so now highlights the severity of Russia’s manpower shortages and signals a growing desperation.\n\nIt’s not clear that the mobilization will make any operational difference on the battlefield, or merely prolong the length of the war without changing the outcome, according to Russian military analysts.\n\nAnd while Russia flails on the battlefield, officials in Moscow have scrambled to assign blame for Russia’s abrupt turn in fortunes, a senior NATO official said.\n\n“Kremlin officials and state media pundits have been feverishly discussing the reasons for the failure in Kharkiv and in typical fashion, the Kremlin seems to be attempting to deflect the blame away from Putin and onto the Russian military,” this person said.\n\nAlready, there has been a reshuffling of military leadership in response to the battlefield failures – leaving Russia’s command structure even more jumbled than it was before, sources say. The commander who oversaw the majority of the units around the Kharkiv region had been in the post only 15 days and has now been relieved of duty, the NATO official said.\n\nRussia has sent “a small number” of troops into eastern Ukraine – some of whom had fled amid Ukraine’s battlefield advances last week, according to two US defense officials – an effort to shore up its weakened defensive lines.\n\nRelated articleZelensky calls for Russia to be stripped of UN veto power\n\nBut even if Russia is able to coalesce around a plan, US and western officials believe Russia is limited in its ability to mount a strategically significant response to Ukraine’s counteroffensive operations that in recent days, sources say, has swung the momentum in Kyiv’s favor. Even after the announcement of the partial mobilization, officials are skeptical that Russia is capable of quickly deploying large numbers of troops into Ukraine given its ongoing problems with supply lines, communications and morale.\n\nThe “small scale” of the Russian redeployment is a signal of its inability to mount any serious operations, the senior defense official told CNN.\n\nSo far, Russia has responded to Ukraine’s advances by launching attacks against critical infrastructure like dams and power plants – attacks that the US sees as largely “revenge” attacks rather than operationally significant salvos, this person said.\n\nAbsent more manpower that, right now, it simply doesn’t have, sources said Russia has few other options to penalize or push back Ukrainian forces. Putin is “struggling,” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said in an appearance on CNN on Wednesday.  Russia’s military has “poor unit cohesion, desertions in the ranks, soldiers not wanting to fight,” Kirby said.\n\n“He has terrible morale, unit cohesion on the battlefield, command and control has still not been solved. He’s got desertion problems and he’s forcing the wounded back into the fight. So clearly, manpower is a problem for him,” Kirby said. “He feels like he’s on his back foot, particularly in that northeast area of the Donbass.”\n\nPutin’s mobilization order is significant because it is a direct acknowledgment that Moscow’s “special military operation” wasn’t working and needed to be adjusted, military analysts said.\n\nBut for now, there are more questions..."}

In the next Bundestag election in 2021, I will not run again as Chancellor. I will not run for the German Bundestag any more, and I do not want any other political office.”\n\nMerkel told reporters that being Chancellor has been a “very challenging and fulfilling task.”\n\nMerkel’s decision appears to mark the beginning of the end of her 13-year dominance of European politics.\n\nMerkel also announced on Monday that she would stand down from the chairmanship of her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party after 18 years in the post.\n\nShe said that she’s known since the summer break that she no longer wanted to be the CDU chairman and that during the party’s conference in December she will not run again for the position.\n\nThe announcement is a sign of Merkel’s weakened power within her own party, and waning popularity in the country.\n\nBoth parties under Merkel’s ruling coalition – the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) – suffered heavy losses in a regional election over the weekend.\n\nWhile the CDU remained the largest party in the election, which was held in the central state of Hesse, its vote was down 10% from the previous election.\n\nRelated articleAs Merkelism fades and Brazil moves right, Trumpism is thriving\n\nThis weekend’s election was a second blow to Merkel’s fragile “grand coalition” government. On October 14, the Christian Social Union, or CSU – the Bavarian sister party to the CDU – lost its majority in the Bavarian state parliament.\n\nThe CSU has dominated politics in the state since the end of World War II, ruling for all but three years over the course of nearly seven decades.\n\nSpeaking on October 15, Merkel admitted that voters had lost trust in the government.\n\nBavaria bore the brunt of the 2015 refugee crisis; at its peak, thousands of asylum seekers were crossing into the state every day. Since then, both Merkel and her CSU allies have been criticized for their management of the influx.\n\nLeopold Traugott, policy analyst at think tank Open Europe, told CNN that Merkel was a stable leader in a “global politics that’s become increasingly disorderly.”\n\nHe said that while Germany needs to look for a new leading figure, allies and opponents abroad “will have to prepare for a different, perhaps more difficult partner in Berlin.”\n\n“Germany will become even more inward-looking in the near future – a trend we have seen since last year’s general election already,” Traugott said.\n\n“This means there will be less German involvement in key European debates, but also on global issues the country is less likely to take a leading role.\n\n“It will be particularly painful for French president Emmanuel Macron, who was hoping for Merkel’s support in his plans for wide-reaching European reform. It seems ever less likely he will receive this support from Berlin.”\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Even though stimulus stopped in March of last year, the account balances of our customers at Bank of America have gone up every month since last June or July. If you think about their ability to borrow, their credit card balances are still down from $100 billion to $80 billion.

Amy Klobuchar announced her 2020 presidential intentions. \"I am running for this job for every person who wants their work recognized and rewarded\" and \"every parent who wants a better world for their kids,\" said Klobuchar. \"I am running for every American.\" And no matter what, \"I'll lead from the heart.\"\n\nShe went on to call for a constitutional amendment to overturnCitizens United, for passing a law that automatically registers Americans to vote at age 18, for universal background checks for gun owners, for \"sweeping\" legislation addressing climate change, and for \"net neutrality for all.\"\n\n\"If you don't know the difference between a hack and Slack, it's time to get off the digital highway,\" said Klobuchar in a cringe-worth line apparently meant to demonstrate her tech savvy.\n\nThe 56-year-old, three-term senator has received less national attention than fellow Democratic senators like Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), both of whom have alreadyannounced their 2020candidacies. Klobuchar could benefit from that if it means she's seen as having less baggage, too. But that reputation suffered last week with the release of several stories describing her as a terror to work for.\n\nKlobuchar \"demeaned and berated her staff almost daily, subjecting them to bouts of explosive rage and regular humiliation within the office, according to interviews and dozens of emails reviewed\"byBuzzfeed. Her office had thehighest staff turnover ratein the Senate between 2001-2016, according toPolitico. And then there's this, fromHuffPost:\n\nTalked to a Franken staffer who had an odd experience with a Klobuchar staffer…https://t.co/yc7giMOIFcpic.twitter.com/SG3hzQWZd2\n\n— Amanda Terkel (@aterkel)February 8, 2019\n\nLiberal pundits have rallied around Klobuchar anyway, with manydismissing the ideathat how a senator treats subordinates should matter when assessing her fitness for office. Somesuggestedit was only an issue because she's a woman.\n\nBut in general, and especially with Klobuchar campaigning as thenice Midwestern anti-Trump, her temperament behind the scenes matters. Blowing up at staff and driving them away at high rates don't suggest \"Minnesota nice,\" nor someone who may handle presidential pressure well. More so than being a member of Congress even, head of state is a position that requires restraint and good people skills to dowell.\n\nAside from the high employee-turnover distinction, Klobuchar's tenure in Congress hasn't been terribly remarkable. The successful legislation she's sponsored mostly falls in the category of completely useless, and on occasion actively bad. One of her first successful bills toughened formaldehyde emission standards for plywood, fiberboard, and particleboard. Another set up the Attorney General tomicromanage the disposal of drugsat nursing homes. She's sponsored several bills that slightly tweak theprocess of adoptingchildren from abroad and oneabout rural call quality.\n\nSome of Klobuchar's worst work has been around \"human trafficking.\" Legislation she introduced saw that the National Human Trafficking Hotline (a federal clearinghouse for trafficking tips that provides no actual victims assistance nor investigative action but does report to federal agents)could get more funding than grants going directly to victims services. Another Klobuchar law expanded funding for the Department of Transportation to study and spread dubious propaganda about human trafficking. She's also been an outspoken supporter of last-year's federal ban on prostitution ads (FOSTA-SESTA) and a2017 \"anti-trafficking\" measurethat was full of civil liberties concerns.\n\nIn September 2017, Klobuchar joined John McCain in trying to get tough on online political advertising in order to address alleged election interference. As ScottShackford wroteat the time, \"Russian meddling is just being used as an excuse to do what politicians and federal agencies have wanted for a long time—to regulate how people campaign online.\"\n\nSo far this year, Klobuchar has introduced legislation to strengthen federal law enforcement involvement in cases ofstalking and domestic violence, toban deals between pharmaceutical companiesthat delay generic versions of medication coming to market, and to tightenregulations on social mediacompanies.\n\nStart your day withReason.

The debate centered on what governments can and cannot demand from citizens, and what behaviors one can rightly expect from others.\n\nIt took place many years before the current coronavirus pandemic, but many things that happened at that conference remind me of our circumstances today. Not least,as a political theorist who also studies social ethics, it reminds me that arguments grounded in self-interest can often be correct – but still deeply inadequate.\n\nI recall one participant summarizing her objection to vaccines in the following way: She said that the government demanded that she allow a live biological agent to be injected into her child’s body even though it could not guarantee her child’s safety. For these reasons, she claimed, she had every right to decide that her child would not receive the vaccine.\n\nThis woman’s objection was driven by her suspicion that the MMR vaccine, for measles, mumps and rubella, caused autism.This claim has been shown, repeatedly and conclusively, to be without merit.  Still, she was not entirely wrong. Many vaccines do contain live agents, though they are in aweakened or attenuated state. And while adverse and even serious reactions have been known to occur, such a risk isinfinitesimally small. Indeed, the preponderance of evidence shows that the risk of harm or death to the unvaccinated child from infections such as MMR isfar greater than any associated with receiving the vaccine.\n\nBut more importantly, this parent’s decision to reject the vaccine affected more than just her child. Because so many parents refuse vaccination for their children, outbreaks of measles have taken place throughout the U.S. In fact, in 2019 the United States reportedits highest number of cases of measles in 25 years.\n\nMany individuals are rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine forsimilar reasons – that is, reasons grounded in self-interest. They say that COVID vaccines are experimental, their long-term effects are unknown and that emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration was rushed.\n\nIn fact, while the vaccines weregiven emergency authorizationto expedite their availability to the general public, they are not experimental but rather the result ofyears of  already existing researchon mRNA vaccines and coronaviruses – the family of viruses including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. And they received authorization only afterconclusive evidence showing they were indeed safe.\n\nThose who reject the COVID vaccine also note that many receiving the vaccine have had an adverse reaction, includingflu-like symptomsthat are short-lived but often quite unpleasant. Cases ofanaphylactic shockor blood clots have also happened, but they havebeen extremely rare, andsafeguards on how to provide immediate care are in placefor any such eventuality.\n\nHere again the risks associated with the vaccine are extremely small, but for some people, still real. Therefore these individuals apparently decided that theywould rather take their chances with the disease itself. Many are young and don’t think the disease will affect them, and many more don’t trust the doctors, scientists and politicians who they say are pushing them to take the vaccine.\n\nOne could readily dispute these claims, too. In fact,rising vaccination ratesover the past few weeks show that many people have reevaluated the risks of remaining unvaccinated. Whether these people have seen evidence of the virulence of the delta variant or have seen for themselves that millions of people have taken the vaccine and are completely fine,their evaluation of their own self-interest has changed.\n\nNevertheless, manyothers remain adamantthat these risks are unacceptable. Like that parent from many years ago, these individuals are not entirely wrong. There are risks associated with getting the vaccine. And knowing these risks, and knowing that they bear the costs of their decision, many Americans believe that they alone have the right to decide. What the government or anyone else wants is beside the point.\n\nBut here again, the costs of refusing the vaccine are not borne by the individual alone.Rising case numbers and hospitalizations,renewed restrictionsregarding public events, even theemergence of the delta variantitself are happening largely because many millions of Americans chose not to get the vaccine. And for parents of children under 12 who cannot yet receiv..."}

If granted, they will be allowed to work while they wait for an asylum determination to be made.\n\nSome 243,000 Venezuelans already have the status stemming from a 2021 policy that was renewed last year.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the expansion of protected status for Venezuelans was warranted due to the country's \"increased instability and lack of safety\".\n\n\"Temporary protected status provides individuals already present in the United States with protection from removal when the conditions in their home country prevent their safe return,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.\n\n\"That is the situation that Venezuelans who arrived here on or before 31 July of this year find themselves in.\"\n\nThose who have arrived after that date, Mr Mayorkas said, will \"be removed when they are found to not have a legal basis to stay\".\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams had been calling on President Joe Biden to allow migrants to have access to employment.\n\nThe city has been struggling to shelter tens of thousands of migrants, many of them from Venezuela, in more than 200 hotels, shelters, tent cities and other facilities.\n\nMr Adams, a Democrat, blamed the federal and state government for not providing enough aid for the city to offer housing and other social services for new arrivals.\n\n\"Our administration and our partners across the city have led the calls to 'Let Them Work,' so I want to thank President Biden for hearing our entire coalition, including our hard-working congressional delegation, and taking this important step that will bring hope to the thousands of Venezuelan asylum seekers currently in our care who will now be immediately eligible for Temporary Protected Status,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nIn a joint statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries - both New York Democrats - said that the move is a \"welcome step forward\" that \"will provide needed relief to New York's systems straining to support newly arrived immigrants\".\n\n\"The decision will also substantially reduce the cost to New York taxpayers with respect to the sheltering of asylum seekers,\" the statement added.\n\nNew York's Governor, Kathy Hochul, said that while there's \"more work to do\", state officials are ready to \"immediately\" begin the process of \"signing people up for work [and] getting them into jobs so they can become self-sufficient\".\n\nThe number of migrants illegally crossing the US-Mexico border has rebounded in recent months, after a drop in May following the Biden administration's new stricter asylum rules.\n\nRepublican-led states have been transporting migrants to Democratic-run areas in protest at border policies.\n\nThey said the measure was designed to increase pressure on President Biden to do more to reduce the number of migrants crossing the southern US border.\n\nThe United Nations says more than seven million people have left Venezuela as the oil giant's economy has collapsed under President Nicolas Maduro, who has been in power since 2013.\n\nEven if the budget swiftly clears Congress, it will still take days to reopen the government.\n\nThe spending plan may have passed the Senate, but it's not yet a done deal in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nRepublicans sound confident the bill will pass, despite their narrow majority.

TheWashington Postdeclares this morning, “Republicans have grown increasingly worried about losing control of the Senate.”Roll Call’sStuart Rothenberg pronounces “the Senate is now in play.” Even Fox Newsconcurs, “for Republican leaders seeking to maintain control of the Senate, some races are becoming a little too close for comfort.”\n\nBut Josh Kraushaar’scolumn atNational Journalis called “Against the Grain,” and it’s apt because he regularly enjoys puncturing the balloon of the political conventional wisdom.\n\nHe’s not quite so convinced about the latest Democratic optimism.\n\nIf Republicans can defeat two of the six vulnerable Democratic senators up for reelection, they’ve locked down their majority for another cycle. Strategists from both parties agree that Republicans have pulled ahead in North Dakota, where Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is facing a spirited challenge from Rep. Kevin Cramer. Public polls show Missouri’s and Florida’s contests as pure toss-ups, while Indiana remains highly competitive. Democrats have the momentum in West Virginia and Montana, but the conservative nature of those electorates give Republicans an outside chance.\n\nIf North Dakota already leans in their direction, Republicans would need just one more of these red-state races to clinch a majority—regardless of what happens with the several seats they have to defend. Even if Republicans fall short, Democrats would still need to win a GOP-held seat on deeply conservative turf, either in Tennessee or in Texas.\n\nTake another look at those vulnerable Democratic seats. While Florida should be a close race, incumbent Bill Nelson hasn’t led a public poll since June. Missouri’s looking very similar, with several surveys showing ties or small leads for Republican Josh Hawley; incumbent Claire McCaskill hasn’t led a public survey since May. We haven’t had a public poll of North Dakota since June, but that one had Republican Kevin Cramer up by four. And note, this is with the political wind at Democrats’s back, at least nationally.\n\n(There’s mixed evidence of whether undecided voters tend to break to the challenger. AWashington Postanalysis pooh-poohed that conventional wisdomin 2014, but then later that year Republican Senate candidates across the mapoverperformed their final polling averages,sometimes by double digits.)\n\nIf Republicans win in Florida, Missouri, and North Dakota, it means the drama ends early on Election Night, at least for control of the Senate.\n\nDemocrats can assure themselves that Indiana’s Joe Donnelly, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, and Montana’s Jon Tester are in stronger shape than expected. But there’s another shoe that hasn’t dropped yet. All of these incumbents have to vote for or against Brett Kavanaugh to be the next justice on the Supreme Court. A “yes” vote probably frustrates the Democratic grassroots in their states; a “no” vote outrages and energizes the grassroots Republicans.\n\nNow let’s go through the vulnerable Republican seats. A newpoll of Arizona’s Senate raceout this morning put Republican Martha McSally up by three points over Kyrsten Sinema; the previous poll put McSally up by one. Nevada’s Senate race has only seen one recent survey, and that put Democrat Jacky Rosen up by one point.\n\nProgressives are really excited about Beto O’Rourke in Texas, and he’s no doubt performing much better than the typical Democrat in Texas. But he still hasn’t, you know,led a poll.If O’Rourke wins, it will indeed be a huge deal. But if Cruz wins this closely, I wonder if Democrats will be kicking themselves over the national hype and attention paid to O’Rourke throughout the summer. If you’re aiming to pull off a huge upset, sometimes the best option is to be under the radar for as long as possible to let the incumbent get complacent. Ask Dave Brat or Scott Brown. In fact, building strength under the radar while the incumbent puts in minimal effort isa big part of how O’Rourke won his House seat. No doubt Team Cruz will be pulling out all of the stops between now and November.\n\nAnd while Tennessee Democrats have reason to cheer over Phil Bredesen’s two-point lead over Republican Marsha Blackburn in the latest poll, I can remember 2006, when Harold Ford Jr. was on the cover ofNewsweek, under the headline “Not Your Daddy’s Democrats“one week before Election Day.Newsweekdec..."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Senate Vote Temporary Spending Bill Prevent Government Shutdown", "output": "WASHINGTON – A short-term spending bill that would fund the government through early next year and avert a looming government shutdown cleared its first hurdle Wednesday night when it won approval in the Senate.\n\nSenators voted by voice vote to approve the spending measure, which would temporarily end a budget impasse by funding nine federal departments and several smaller agencies at their current funding levels through Feb. 8.\n\nThe bill now goes to the House, which could approve it on Thursday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., offered the temporary spending bill after President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the nation’s southern border resulted in a standoff that threatened to shut down parts of the government. The temporary spending bill punts a decision on border wall funding until next year.\n\n“We don’t want to end this year the way we began it, with another government shutdown,” McConnell said.\n\nNine federal departments and several smaller agencies – a quarter of the government – will run out of money and shut down at midnight Friday unless Congress and the White House agree to extend their funding.\n\nWhether Trump will sign the short-term funding bill remains uncertain. Trump boasted during an Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders last week that he would be “proud” to shut down the government over border security and that he’d be willing to take the blame for any fallout.\n\nBut the White House retreated from that threat this week. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that Trump asked his Cabinet secretaries to look for other sources of funding to help protect the border and suggested that the administration is looking to Congress for ways to avoid a shutdown.\n\n“We've laid out clearly what our parameters are with members of Congress,” Sanders said. “We want to know what they can pass. We want to know what they think they can actually get done. We've laid out what we'd like to see. In the meantime, we're looking at other areas where we can draw money from to make sure that the president can actually protect our border and protect American citizens.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, before McConnell had announced plans for the temporary funding bill, one of Trump’s top advisers, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, said he might sign a short-term measure. But she insisted he was not giving up on his campaign promise to build a border wall.\n\n“There are other ways for him to get that money and he said, one way or another, he will get the money for the border security,” Conway said.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, McConnell expressed confidence that a shutdown would be avoided even though Democrats rejected an earlier GOP proposal to end the impasse.\n\nIn an 11th-hour attempt at compromise, McConnell proposed approving a spending bill that would include $1.6 billion for border fencing along with an additional $1 billion for immigration. Democrats described the additional funding as a \"slush fund\" and rejected the offer.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the GOP proposal would have allowed Trump to continue “his very wrong immigration policies.”\n\n“That won’t happen,” she said.\n\nMcConnell followed up with the offer of a short-term spending bill, and Pelosi said House Democrats would support it.\n\nOn the Senate floor, McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting the earlier compromise out of \"knee-jerk, partisan opposition\" to Trump.\n\n“It seems like political spite for the president may be winning out over sensible policy,\" he said.\n\nNine federal departments wait for Congress to approve their budgets. Those departments are Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Transportation, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development, as well as several smaller agencies.\n\nBoth of the government shutdowns during Trump’s presidency were ended by short-term funding bills.\n\nIn January, parts of the government shut down for three days after an impasse in the Senate over federal funding. The shutdown ended when the Senate passed a short-term spending measure.\n\nLess than three weeks later, the government shut down for a second time after Congress failed to pass a spending bill to keep the agencies running. That shutdown ended after only six hours when lawmakers passed a six-week spending bill.\n\nContributing: John Fritze, Nicole Gaudiano and David Jackson"}

That is now the central choice in the 2022 election.” I can’t help but wonder how many gas stations witha price around $4.36 per gallonMaloney passed as he was typing that tweet.\n\nA Supreme Court decision overturningRoe v. Wadeis indeed likely to fire up the Democratic grassroots, at least to some degree. When all the votes of the 2022 midterm election are counted and tabulated, Democrats who support legal abortion may well be able to point to a governor’s race or two, some U.S. House races, and maybe even a vulnerable Senate incumbent or two who was saved because of Democrats voting on the abortion issue.\n\nThe problem for the Democrats is that the demographics who are most passionately supportive of legal abortion are by and large already supporting their candidates. Based on historical polling, includingthe Pew Research poll, women with college degrees and self-identified Democrats are the most supportive of legal abortion. About 80 percent of Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, women are slightly more supportive of legal abortion than men, and college graduates are more supportive of legal abortion than those who have not completed or attended college.\n\nIn themost recent NPR Marist poll, 26 percent of white women with college degrees strongly approved of the job President Biden was doing. That figure was 15 percent among white women without college degrees, 14 percent among men with college degrees, and 11 percent among men without college degrees. In the same poll, 57 percent of white women with college degrees said they intended to vote for the Democratic candidate in this year’s election for Congress. By contrast, only 46 percent of white men with college degrees said they intended to vote for the Democrat, as did 37 percent of white women without college degrees, and 28 percent of white men without college degrees.\n\nIn other words, the people likely to be most outraged by the overturning ofRoe v. Wadewere already planning to vote for Democrats in 2022. What’s more, pro-choice voters are more likely to live in blue states that already have pro-choice Democratic governors, senators, House members and state legislators. And pro-choice voters probably aren’t numerous enough to make a difference in heavily-Republican, pro-life red states. Once again, purple swing states will be the main battlefield of the culture war.\n\nOh, and in the lastfour monthly Gallup pollsasking Americans, “What do you think is the most important problem facing the country today?”, abortion has not registered at even one percent. The Supreme Court decision will likely change that, at least for a while, but is it going to overtake inflation (17 percent), the economy in general (11 percent) or fuel/oil prices (4 percent)?\n\nNote that back in February,the new Texas abortion law was a non-factor in the advertising leading up to this year’s primary: “Airwaves are not swamped with campaign ads focused on abortion access. Candidates spend more time talking about COVID-19, immigration and the reliability of the power grid. Some rallies and events come and go without even a mention of Texas having the most restrictive abortion law in the country on the books for months now.”\n\nMaybe if inflation was under control, Americans weren’t groaning and gasping every time they looked at their grocery bill or filled up their tank, the supply chain issues were resolved, crime was low, the border was secure, American parents had faith in the performance of their local schools, Ukraine and Russia weren’t at war, and we otherwise enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity, then yes, abortion would probably dominate our public debate in a midterm election year. But it is likely to remain one controversial issue among many.\n\n© 2025 National Review\n\nNewsletters\n\n© 2025 National Review"}

The Hollywood Reporter went gaga over it and bizarrely claimed she “Speaks Out Against Anti-Gay Senate Candidate.” People gleefully headlined she was “Slamming Republican Candidate.”\n\nSuch is the state of liberalism today that The Washington Post asked: “Can Taylor Swift, revered by young Americans, help lead Democrats out of the woods?” If Taylor Swift is Moses, Hollywood has to be the Promised Land.\n\nOnly that’s not where three-fourths of the public wants to go. According to a Media Research Center/McLaughlin & Associates poll of likely voters, 74 percent don’t want politics in their entertainment or sports.

And that will also help.”\n\nDespite calls from experts for Americans to get their vaccines and boosters, the rate of booster doses getting administered has fallen in recent weeks – while only 32.7% of the country’s fully vaccinated population is boosted.\n\nIn addition to getting vaccinated and boosted, people can protect themselves by taking precautions in public, Jha said.\n\nRelated videoOmicron derails holiday plans, strains hospitals\n\n“I would urge people to wear a higher quality mask any time they’re in a place with lots of people and they’re going to be indoors for any extended period of time,” Jha said.\n\nA surgical mask might be fine for a quick grocery store trip in an empty store, but for other events, a well-fittingN95 or KF94 maskprovides better protection, he said.\n\nLooking ahead to New Year’s Eve on Friday, small gatherings of fully vaccinated people will be safe, Dr. Anthony Fauci said. But people should avoid large parties where they don’t know the vaccination status of all guests, he said.\n\n“When you are talking about a New Year’s Eve party where you have 30, 40, 50 people celebrating, you do not know the status of the vaccination, I would recommend strongly: Stay away from that this year,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n“There will be other years to do that. But not this year.”\n\nHoliday gatherings, like those over Christmas and New Year’s, have some health care workers worried about the impact on children in the coming weeks – especially those who are too young to be vaccinated.\n\nRelated articleNew Omicron variant fills up children's hospitals\n\n“We’ve just had all of these kids mixing together with everybody else during Christmas,” said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, the director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Ohio.\n\n“We have one more holiday to get through with New Year’s, and then we’ll be sending everybody back to school. Everybody is kind of waiting on the edge, wondering what we’ll end up seeing.”\n\nNationwide, pediatric Covid-19 hospitalizations are nearing the record high set in September.\n\nOn average, roughly 305 children were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended December 26, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThat’s more than a 48% jump from the previous week’s average and just 10.7% lower than the peak average of 342 children who were admitted to hospitals with the virus that was recorded at the end of August and early September.\n\nIn New York City, where cases are surging and the average percent positivity rate is continuing to trend upward, pediatric hospitalizations increased five-fold over a three-week period.\n\nIn Chicago, hospitalizations at one children’s hospital have quadrupled. At Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, close to half the Covid-19 tests are coming back positive.\n\nAt Texas Children’s Pediatrics & Urgent Care in Houston, the chief medical officer is concerned about the current surge, he said.\n\n“What’s concerning on the (pediatric) side is that, unlike the adults – where they’re reporting for the number of adults getting infected relatively low numbers getting hospitalized – what we’re really seeing, we think, is an increasing number of kids being hospitalized,” Dr. Stanley Spinner said.\n\nChildren are an easy target for the virus, said Dr. Juan Salazar, physician in chief at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center in Hart..."}

The most notable raid was the arrest of nearly 700 illegal aliens at food processing plants inMississippi in 2019-- in what became the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration has dramatically narrowed ICE's scope for enforcement, including rules that limit ICE officers to focusing on recent border crossers, aggravated felons and national security threats.

Nothing less than the future of Texas,” Abbott wrote. “If a small fraction of recalcitrant lawmakers choose to run out the clock today, they can do so for any, and every, Regular or Special Session, potentially bankrupting the State in an attempt to get their way.”\n\nIn a response filed with the court Friday, Wu said he had not abandoned his office and argued the entire lawsuit against him should be thrown out.\n\n“To the contrary, he continues to carry out his legislative duties as his judgment dictates,” lawyers for Wu wrote in the filing. In asking for the case to be dismissed, they noted that Wu had not died, nor had he been expelled by the House by a two-thirds vote or voluntarily resigned — all of which would be grounds for removal from office under state law.\n\nAttorney GeneralKen Paxton, who threatened to file similar legal actions earlier in the day against multiple House Democrats, followed Abbott’s emergency petition by sending his own letter to the state Supreme Court hours later, in which he argued that Abbott lacked the authority to request the removal.\n\nPaxton wrote that while he “appreciates the Governor’s passion” for restoring a quorum, state law permits only the attorney general or a local county or district attorney to bring what’s known asa quo warranto proceeding, which seeks a member’s removal on the grounds that they have abandoned their office.\n\nIn the letter, Paxton said he would take action against the absent legislators if the House continued to lack a quorum on Friday, the deadline set by House SpeakerDustin Burrows. He followed through on the threat,asking the Supreme CourtFriday afternoon to expel 13 Democrats from the chamber while echoing Abbott’s argument that the lawmakers had effectively abandoned their offices.\n\nAbbott later clarified in asocial media postthat his filing sought quo warranto through a provision in the Texas Constitution and a separate portion of government code, which he said would give his office the proper authority. He also attached a letter addressed to the state Supreme Court in the post that stated “at least 500 years of common law” made it clear the governor’s office could make the filing.\n\nPaxton previously acknowledged that this would likely be a lengthy and complicated process, telling conservative podcaster Benny Johnson that his office would have to bring individual lawsuits in each member’s district. But in Friday’s filing, he argued that the Texas Supreme Court has the right to rule directly on the ..."}

In August 2020, Russian dissidentAlexei Navalnyhad been poisoned, probably atthe directionof Russian PresidentVladimir Putin, who saw in Navalny one of the vanishingly few legitimate threats to his reign.\n\nNavalny went to Germany to recuperate. While there, he managed to confirm that the poisoning had been carried out by Russian security services by calling one of his would-be executioners andpretending to be a fellow Kremlin goon. Mother Russia wanted one of her own sons dead.\n\nSo why return? “It was never a question of whether to return or not,” he wrote in a social media post in Jan. 2021. Several days later,he landed at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport, where he was greeted by admirers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe Russians in the West admired him, too. I saw in his return a refutation of the argument that all Russians wanted was Louis Vuitton boutiques—freedom and democracy be damned. He came back to remind us, whether we were in Brooklyn or Kaliningrad, that we were better than that. Or that we could be, in any case.\n\nNavalny waspromptly arrestedon entirely fictitious fraud charges that were intended to keep him sitting comfortably at some Washington or Berlin think tank, no threat at all to the Stalinist project underway in Moscow.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe wasn’tsupposedto come back. Only he didn’t get the message.\n\nHe would never see freedom again. An obeisant court found him guilty, then tacked on “extremism” charges for good measure. “They really do initiate a new criminal case against me every three months. Rarely does an inmate confined to a solitary cell for over a year have such a vibrant social and political existence,” he said ina typically sarcastic social mediapost conveyed via his representatives.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNavalny became acause célèbre, one of the few figures within Russia we Russians could be proud of. In arguing that we were better than the country shelling Ukrainian innocents, we could always point to Navalny, even as he lookedincreasingly gauntin the video footage made available by his jailers.\n\nThere, look at him. As long as Navalny lives, there is a hope of a better Russia.As long as he lives.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlexei Navalny speaks with journalists in Moscow, July 20, 2019.\n\nFinally, they did what so many of us always feared they were going to do. On Friday,Navalny diedat the IK-3 penal colony in Kharp, a remote Siberian village. He apparentlycollapsed after a walk. He had been in poor health for many months, as he moved from one penal colony to another, suffering prolonged stretches of isolation and other privations.\n\nI grew up in the same country as Navalny: the faded Soviet Union of the 1980s. The desperation of those years, and the chaos of the 1990s, drove many Russians (including my own family) to the West. Some of those who stayed only did so because they figured they could get rich. A seller of blue jeans could suddenly become a copper magnate, as long as he could survivethe mafia hits that came with a regular cadence in Moscow and St. Petersburgthroughout the go-go Yeltsin years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn attorney by training, Navalny did not stay to get rich. He stayed for the same reason that would see him return in 2021. He truly believed in Russia, in the possibility of a democratic nation rising from the ruins of the Soviet empire.\n\nAlexei Navalny appears via a video link from his prison colony during his appeal against the nine-year prison sentence he was handed in March, in Moscow on May 17, 2022.\"\n\nOnly that wasn’t the country that took shape. “I can’t stop myself from fiercely, wildly hating those who sold, pissed away, and squandered the historical chance that our country had in the early 1990s,”he would later say.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHaving never won an election, Putin emerged in 1999 to replace the inept and inebriated Yeltsin. He quickly arrogated every means of power, even as Western leaders like George W. Bushfoolishly insistedthat he was committed to democracy.\n\nI returned to Russia for the first time in more than two decades in 2003. The country looked almost Western: Western-ish. I was impressed. The erosion of democracy, already underway, seemed like a small price to pay for upscale beer gardens where once had stood drab cafeterias.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThen the price rose. In 2006, the investigative journalist Anna Politkovskayawas murderedfor reporting on the brutality of Putin’s campaign to pacify the restive republic of Chechnya, as well as his repressions targeting every segment of Russian society. Politkovskaya saw clearly what was happening. “Who can say,”she wondered, “we are not returning to Stalinist ways under Putin?”\n\nNavalny refused to let it pass.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf some in the West had had a too sunny view of Russia, as if it were nothing but a Harvard Business School case study in unfettered capitalism, there were others whogrumbledthat Russians were “incapable” of democracy, that something in the Russian spirit required iron-fisted leadership.

A handful of staff have left recently after not having their contracts renewed, and other members have been told to look for other jobs.Platformerdescribes the turmoil as a “dismantling” of the research group.\n\nStanford Internet Observatory research centers on some of the most pressing types of abuse online, including threats to democracy and elections, artificial intelligence, and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The group’s cutting-edge, real-time research on content moderation has been cited by news outlets around the world,includinghereatThe Vergemanytimes. Stamosfounded the Internet Observatory in 2018after working as Facebook’s chief security officer, hoping to create more accountability and transparency for issues that touch the tech industry, academia, and Capitol Hill.\n\nStanford didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the Internet Observatory’s future but toldPlatformerthat the Internet Observatory’s work will continue under new leadership and that the university “remains deeply concerned about efforts... that chill freedom of inquiry and undermine legitimate and much needed academic research.”Platformernotes that some of the group’s work, includinga peer-reviewed journal and conference on trust and safety, will remain.\n\nThe Internet Observatory’s work, like its research intoelection integrity, has made it a target for right-wing and Republican attacks. Researchers working on Election Integrity Partnershiphave been suedby right-wing groups who accuse them of “mass-surveillance and mass-censorship.”\n\nThe censorship claim stems from how the federal government communicates with social media platforms around topics like covid-19 disinformation and threats to elections. Government agencies sometimes communicate with platforms like Facebook, for example, to share public health information. Ina case that has reached the Supreme Court, Republican attorneys general say the Biden administration suppressed free speech when it “coerced” social media companies into moderating certain content on their platforms. Researchers who study these topics and may share findings with the government havebecome recurring boogeyman charactersin right-wing conspiracy theories online.\n\nIn response to lawsuits brought by attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, Stanfordhas assertedthat researchers have the right to conduct research and share their findings, including with government entities.\n\n“Stanford will continue to defend its First Amendment rights — including those of its faculty, staff and students, who are free to investigate all manner of subjects, free to collaborate with other scholars and organizations, and free to communicate their findings to the public, to private enterprise and to the government,” the university wrote.\n\nLawsuits targeting the Internet Observatory and other related research institutions could create a chilling effect for people studying contentious issues online — particularly given the changes underway at Stanford. Individual researchers havefaced threats against their careers and personal safety, and the potential reorganizing of the Internet Observatory is likely to be celebrated by the same forces working to delegitimize its work in the first place.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nSee All byMia Sato\n\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nSee AllNews\n\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nSee AllPolicy\n\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nSee AllPolitics\n\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nSee AllRegulation\n\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email di..."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Criminal Justice Judge Denies Trump Dojs Request Unseal Ghislaine Maxwell Grand Jury Documents", "output": "A Manhattan federal judge on Monday denied the Trump administration’s bid to unseal grand jury documents in the case against dead sex predatorJeffrey Epstein’s accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nUS District Judge Paul Engelmayer said the transcripts revealed “next to nothing new” — in a scathing decision that ripped the Justice Department for overhyping the files, going so far as to suggest it was all a “diversion.”\n\n“There is no ‘there’ there,” Engelmayer wrote in his searing 31-page ruling finding that the DOJ failed to make a compelling case to disclose the grand jury testimony, which typically remains sealed.\n\nThe “entire premise — that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the government’s investigation into them — is demonstrably false,” he wrote.\n\n“The court’s review confirmed that unsealing the grand jury materials would not reveal new information of any consequence.”\n\nIn a sharp jab, the judge said that the best argument for releasing the files was to demonstrate how “disingenuous” the DOJ has been in its arguments for unsealing the transcripts.\n\n“[One] might conclude that the Government’s motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency’ but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” Engelmayer wrote.The judge also said that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, when asked to highlight any new pieces of information in the testimony, flagged only “scattered words, clauses and occasional sentences” that would provide “next to nothing new” for any member of the public interested in knowing more about Epstein’s sick sex schemes.\n\nThe government had provided the judge with a copy of the transcripts and their highlighted portions on Friday.\n\n“The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein’s or Maxwell’s,” Engelmayer wrote.\n\n“They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein’s or Maxwell’s crimes,” he continued. “They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein’s death. They do not reveal the path of the Government’s investigation.”\n\nNo victim testified to the grand jury in either Maxwell or Epstein’s case, the government has said. The transcripts instead include two law enforcement witnesses who summarized the evidence for the limited purpose of securing the indictments.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondiand Blanche petitioned for the release of the records July 18 amid ongoing controversy over the Epstein case, claiming that they could provide “significant” new information.\n\nThe move came over an uproar overBondi’s decisionnot to release any of the 300-gigabyte trove of Epstein files that the government says it has in its possession. Those records include possibly juicy details about what FBI agents found in Epstein’s mansions in Manhattan, Palm Beach and on his private island.\n\nIn rare instances, grand jury testimony has been unsealed for historical cases of interest and situations where there was a “particularized need” that outweighed strict secrecy requirements.\n\nBut Engelmayer concluded: “Contrary to the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents.”\n\n“The information it contains is already almost entirely a matter of longstanding public record,” he wrote, especially as a result of testimony from Maxwell’s 2021 sex-trafficking trial in Manhattan federal court.\n\nThedisgraced British socialite was convictedof grooming young girls for abuse by Epstein, and sentenced to 20 years behind bars.\n\nBlanche,President Trump’s former defense attorney, met with Maxwell last month at the US attorney’s office in Tallahassee for hours last month.\n\nMaxwell was latertransferred to Federal Prison Camp Bryan, a minimum-security prison complex for women in Texas.\n\nEarlier this month, the powerful House Oversight Committee postponed its planned deposition of Maxwell after subpoenaing her for deposition. When Congress reconvenes from the August recess next month, it is expected to grapple with legislation to compel the release of more Epstein files.\n\nEngelmayer took note of the political interest in his decision, but stressed that it didn’t impact his ruling.\n\nThe government has separately urged another judge to unseal grand jury transcripts in Epstein’s case, and that judge has yet to rule.\n\nAdvertisement"}

The BBCannouncedit was bringing back the WWII-era broadcasting technology in the region just hours before its sites were banned. News of the ban was also reported by Russian state news agency RIA.\n\nShortwave radio uses frequencies that carry over long distances and are accessible on portable sets. The BBC says its shortwave broadcasts will be available on frequencies of 15735 kHz from 4PM to 6PM and 5875 kHz from 10PM to midnight, Ukraine time. News will be read in English, which the BBC says will be available in Kyiv as well as “parts of Russia.”\n\nShortwave radio has a long history of wartime broadcasts.The Guardianreports that its usage peaked during the Cold War, but that it was also used throughout WWII to broadcast propaganda. The BBC World Service ended its use of the technology in Europe in 2008 after 76 years.\n\nThe state-ownedRussian RIA news agencyreported that in addition to blocking BBC News, the Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor has also restricted access to the US government-funded Radio Liberty, US state-owned radio broadcaster Voice of America, Meduza (a Russian and English-language news site based in Latvia), and German state-owned broadcaster Deutsche Welle.\n\nThe BBC’s Russia Twitter account is also advising that Russians download its iOS and Android apps as a workaround to access its online coverage. In 2019, the corporation also launched aTor Onion domain, which is designed to offer a more secure, higher performance, and censorship-resistant way to access its website via Tor browsers compared to a typical .com or .co.uk URL.

Direct traffic to its Russian language coverage was more than triple its usual levels last week (10.7 million visits versus an average of 3.1 million), while visitors to its English-language content in Russia increased by 252 percent last week. Visits to its Ukrainian-language coverage more than doubled.\n\n“In a conflict where disinformation and propaganda is rife, there is a clear need for factual and independent news people can trust,” said BBC director-general Tim Davie. “We will continue giving the Russian people access to the truth, however we can.”\n\nHowever, later in the week, in response to anew law that threatened journalistswith up to 15 years in prison for publishing “fake news,” the BBC announced that it would be temporarily suspending the work of its journalists in Russia while it assessed the implications of the law. “The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs,” BBC director-general Tim Davie said in a statement.\n\n“Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia,” Davie added.\n\nWhile the BBC’s reach is being limited inside Russia, Russian state-backed media organizations RT and Sputnik are being targeted outside of the country bytechplatformsandregulatorsalike.\n\nCorrection March 4th, 11:03AM ET:This article originally stated that the broadcasts will run between 6 and 8PM, and midnight and 2AM, Ukraine time.

So Trump unblocked the seven plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed by theKnight First Amendment Institute, but not the others he had previously blocked.\n\nAlthough theJustice Department announced in June that it would appeal, earlier this month, Knight asked the White House tounblock an additional 41 accounts. On Tuesday night, that happened ― at least for some of them.\n\nKnight is now asking others who have been Trump-blocked toget in touch.\n\nComedy writer Bess Kalb took a moment to savor the victory:\n\nThank you to the Knight Foundation for legally forcing@realDonaldTrumpto take out his sticky little phone, scrunch his nose, open Twitter, search my name, shout “Do I seriously have to fucking do this,” be told yes by Dan Scavino, take a deep breath, and click “Unblock.”\n\nI know it certainly wasn’t him, but the tiny glimmer of hope that this even could have somewhat happened is what will sustain me for another day.\n\nThen, newly unblocked by Trump, she turned around and blocked him instead:\n\nOh my fucking god this feels so good.pic.twitter.com/5CuwDmNnI1\n\nJules Suzdaltsev was blocked in May 2017 after urging Trump to spend more time with his son.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Capitol Police officers who were attacked and beaten during the Capitol riot filed a lawsuit Thursday against former President Donald Trump, his allies and members of far-right extremist groups, accusing them of intentionally sending a violent mob on Jan. 6 to disrupt the congressional certification of the election.\n\nThe suit in federal court in Washington alleges Trump “worked with white supremacists, violent extremist groups, and campaign supporters to violate the Ku Klux Klan Act, and commit acts of domestic terrorism in an unlawful effort to stay in power.”\n\nThe suit was filed on behalf of the seven officers by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. It names the former president, the Trump campaign, Trump ally Roger Stone and members of the extremist groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers who were present at the Capitol and in Washington on Jan. 6.\n\nTwo other similar cases have been filed in recent months by Democratic members of Congress. The suits allege the actions of Trump and his allies led to the violence siege of the Capitol that injured dozens of police officers, halted the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s electoral victory and sent lawmakers running for their lives as rioters stormed into the seat of American democracy wielding bats, poles and other weapons.\n\nA House committee has started in earnest to investigate what happened that day, sending out requests Wednesday for documents from intelligence, law enforcement and other government agencies. Their largest request so far was made to the National Archive for information on Trump and his former team.\n\nTrump accused the committee of violating “long-standing legal principles of privilege,” but his team had no immediate comment on Thursday’s lawsuit.\n\n“Executive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of my Administration and the Patriots who worked beside me, but on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States and the future of our Nation,” Trump said in a written statement.\n\nAlso Thursday, a Capitol Police officer who fatally shot an unarmed Trump protester told “NBC Nightly News” in an interview that he had no other choice but to shoot.\n\n“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Lt. Michael Byrd said. “I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.”\n\nHe wascleared of any wrongdoingin the shooting of Ashli Babbitt, 35. His name had been withheld by authorities over safety concerns, but he came forward publicly on NBC. Byrd said they were trapped, barricaded inside with lawmakers he was sworn to protect.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Despite a rocky week of fits and starts, President Joe Biden on Friday praised the Senate for edging thebipartisan infrastructureplan closer to passage, ahead of a key vote on the $1 trillion package.\n\nAs Biden spoke from the White House, he compared the “historic investment” to building the transcontinental railroad or the interstate highway system — lofty themes he has touched on before as he nudges Congress along. The public works projects being unleashed will be powered by good-paying, blue-collar jobs, he said.\n\nThe president’s note of encouragement offers a reset for lawmakers after frustrations mounted and tempers flared overnight as the Senate stalled out, unable to expedite the package to completion. Senators will be back for another weekend session.\n\n“It’s a bill that would end years of gridlock in Washington and create millions of good-paying jobs, put America on a new path to win the race for the economy in the 21st century,” Biden said.\n\nThe public works expenditure will “enable us not only to build back but to build back better than before the economic crisis hit,” he said.\n\nIt’s nearing decision time for Congress, and particularly the Senate, to make gains on the president’s infrastructure priorities — first with the bipartisan bill that’s on track for passage as soon as this weekend, and quickly followed byDemocrats’ more sweeping $3.5 trillion budget blueprintthey plan to shoulder on their own.\n\nSenators had hoped to wrap up the bipartisan bill late Thursday, before many of them departed to attend funeral services Friday in Wyoming for a colleague, theformer Republican Sen. Mike Enzi.\n\nBut the Senate ground to a halt with new problems as senators worked late into the night on amendments and to counter objections from Republican opponents of the plan to expedite the process. A procedural vote was set for Saturday.\n\n“We’ve worked long, hard and collaboratively to finish this important bipartisan bill.” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., just before midnight. In announcing Saturday’s schedule, he said, “We very much want to finish.”\n\nCalled the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the thick bill is a first part of Biden’s infrastructure agenda and would inject billions of new spending on roads, bridges, waterworks, broadband and other projects to virtually every corner of the nation. If approved by the Senate, it would next go to the House.\n\nThe late-night session stalled out as new debates emerged over proposed amendments to change the 2,700-page package. Senators have processed nearly two dozen amendments so far, and none has substantially changed the framework of the public works package. With more than a dozen amendments still to go, senators struggled to reach agreements.\n\nA much anticipated analysis of the bill from the Congressional Budget Office also drew concerns, particularly from Republicans. Itconcluded that the legislation would increase deficits by about $256 billionover the next decade, though the bill’s backers argued that the budget office was unable to take into account certain revenue streams — including from future economic growth.\n\nSen.

ChatGPT launched in November 2022 andamassed100 million users in just two months. A year later, it hadmore than 100 million usersper week.\n\nChatGPT’s parent company,OpenAI, was last month roiled by internal conflict over the direction of the fast-growing company and whether to maintain its adherence to safety-first principles on which it was founded, or to follow a less-constrained strategy for growth.\n\nThe conflict resulted inthe oustingof its outspoken CEO, Sam Altman, after which employees rallied for his return and he was successfully rehired. The turmoil, which focused on the leadership of the company as its tools develop more capabilities, did not address an intensifying battle between the providers of information used to train AI systems and the operators of the technology.\n\nOpenAI has been sued over its use of copyrighted materials by fiction writers on multiple occasions, including in oneongoingclass-action lawsuit. The Getty photo archivesueda separate AI firm over its use of its images in February.\n\nThe Times reported that its lawsuit came to fruition after an apparent breakdown in negotiations over the companies’ use of Times material. In the filing, the Times said it had approached the tech firms about the use of its intellectual property to explore “an amicable resolution”, including commercial agreements and “guardrails” around AI products – but the discussions had stalled.\n\nThe lawsuit also broaches the issue of AI “hallucinations”, typically false information that can be wrongly attributed to a source, that it said potentially damages the Times’s brand. It identified material on Microsoft’s Bing Chat that it claims was misidentified as Times content, including results for “the 15 most heart-healthy foods”. Twelve of those had not been mentioned in the Times story, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe Times lawsuit does not contain a monetary claim, but says that OpenAI, valued at $80bn, and its partner Microsoft, valued at $2.8tn, should be held responsible for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages”.\n\nThe suit also called on the companies to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use copyrighted material from the Times.\n\nSign up toTechScape\n\nA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nWith tension growing over use of published materials to train ChatGPT, OpenAI has announced partnerships seeking to assuage concerns. Earlier this month, OpenAIannounced a partnershipwith the German publishing giant Axel Springer to “enrich users’ experience with ChatGPT by adding recent and authoritative content on a wide variety of topics, and explicitly values the publisher’s role in contributing to OpenAI’s products”.\n\n“With this partnership, ChatGPT users around the world will receive summaries of selected global news content from Axel Springer’s media brands,” Open AI said in a press release, adding that information on the system would “include attribution and links to the full articles for transparency and further information”.\n\n“We want to explore the opportunities of AI empowered journalism – to bring quality, societal relevance and the business model of journalism to the next level,” said Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Axel Springer.\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n“We respect the rights of content creators and owners,” OpenAI..."}

They have so far recovered the remains of 24 people, with 121 still missing.\n\nNo one has been pulled out of the rubble alive since the first day following the 24 June collapse at Surfside in southernFlorida.\n\nThe search and rescue mission was suspended on Saturday to allow engineers to prepare the site for demolition. The precarious remaining portion of the 12-storey building was rigged with strategically placed explosives that successfully brought down the structure on Sunday after 10.30pm.\n\nRescuers said they were now just awaiting clearance to resume the work of trying to locate any survivors still buried under the rubble.\n\n“We are standing by. We are ready to go in, no matter the time of night,” Miami-Dade County mayor Daniella Levine Cava told a news conference earlier on Sunday evening.\n\nRescuers believe that the detonation will have allowed them access to some parts of the original collapse site for the first time, especially the garage area that is a focus of interest.\n\nMiami-Dade fire chief Albert Cominsky said that once a new path to enter therubble is secured, “we will go back to the debris pile, and we’ll begin our search and rescue efforts”.\n\nThe decision to take down the building with a controlled explosion came amid mounting concerns that the damaged structure was at risk of falling due to a storm set to hit Florida.\n\nA warning has been issued for the approachingtropical storm Elsa, which could bring strong winds to the area later on Monday, posing a danger to the damaged building and endangering the lives of rescuers.\n\nAccording to the latest forecast, the storm has moved westward, mostly sparing south Florida, with heavy rain and sustained winds of 60mph. But officials said the area could still feel the effects of the storm.\n\nMeanwhile, the mayor asked residents to stay inside their houses and close their windows for at least two hours after the blast. Local authorities sent representatives door to door to advise neighbours.\n\nMs Levine Cava expressed sympathy with the families of people still missing in the rubble, and said those who were asked to evacuate from the remaining part of the building had “left their entire lives behind”.\n\n“I truly believe ... that the family members recognise and appreciate that we are proceeding in the best possible fashion to allow us to do the search that we need to do,” Ms Levine Cava said.\n\nThe demolition involved a technique known as “energetic felling”, a method ofcontrolled explosionthat uses small strategically placed detonation devices and relies on the force of gravity.\n\nThe mayor explained that the explosion would bring down the building in a way that disturbed the existing mound of debris as little as possible, as scores of people are still believed to be trapped underneath it.\n\nMiami-Dade Fire Rescue’s assistant chief Ray Jadallah earlier on Sunday said small holes were drilled into the foundation of the building, where explosive charges were placed.\n\nA general contractor was hired by state officials to lead the demolition.

It’s never forget what happened so we can prevent it from happening again.”\n\nAt a hearing in July over the Saudi motion to dismiss the case, attorneys for the families laid out evidence they say reveals the support network involving several high-ranking Saudi officials working in the US – some inside the embassy in Washington, DC – that facilitated the hijackers’ movements across the country.\n\nThe covert, militant network with an “anti-United-States mission,” plaintiff attorney Gavin Simpson said during the July 31 hearing, was “created, funded, directed and supported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its affiliated organizations and diplomatic personnel within [the] United States.”\n\nWhile15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens, Saudi Arabia has denied any government involvement in the attacks. The US has long said itsstrategic Middle East partnerhad no role and that al Qaeda acted on its own in hijacking four commercial airplanes and flying them into the Twin Towers in New York City and the Pentagon. A fourth plane, United Flight 93, crashed in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut allegations of Saudi complicity have persisted. The litigation against Saudi Arabia has evolved since 2002. In 2016 Congress overrode a veto by then-President Barack Obama to enact a law allowing individuals to sue foreign governments for terror attacks, which cleared the way for the families’ claims against Saudi Arabia to proceed.\n\nRelated articleSeptember 11 Victim Aid and Compensation Fast Facts\n\nThousands of lawsuits seeking compensation from Saudi Arabia for allegedly providing material and financial assistance to al Qaeda have been condensed into a multi-district litigation that’s being overseen by a federal district judge in Manhattan.\n\nIn 2018 federal District Judge George Daniels granted a narrow window for the families’ attorneys to seek discovery related to a purported terror cell run by two key players operating around Los Angeles and San Diego. The plaintiffs’ attorneys must prove the two Saudi nationals supported the hijackers as agents for Saudia Arabia at the direction of more senior Saudi officials.\n\nIf Daniels rules the case can continue to move forward, it could lead to more never-before-seen evidence becoming public.\n\nThe arguments in July highlighted evidence amassed through years of discovery slowly turned over by the Department of Justice, the Metropolitan Police Service in the U.K. and the Kingdom, including evidence only recently made public.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs put two Saudi nationals backed by the Kingdom at the top of a Southern California-based terror cell that supported two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar, when they first came to the US in 2000 before eventually crashing American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon.\n\nA Saudi diplomat, Fahad Al Thumairy, stationed in the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles, is said to have been the main designated contact person for al Qaeda and the hijackers in Los Angeles, according to plaintiffs’ court filings.\n\nThumairy worked closely with another key figure in the litigation, Omar al-Bayoumi, in orchestrating the support system for Hazmi and Mihdhar during their time in California before their eventual move east in furtherance of the terror plot, according to the court filings.\n\nBayoumi – who was sponsored by the Kingdom as a student living in the United States had a job with a Saudi contractor – assisted the two hijackers upon their arrival in the country, according to the 20049/11 Commission Report.He helped them find a San Diego apartment, open a bank account and co-signed their lease, the report..."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Biden Approval Ratings Remain Low", "output": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Joe Biden's recent job approval ratings, which are averaging 14 points lower than those early in his presidency, have declined far more among younger than older generations of Americans. In fact, Biden's job approval has changed relatively little among baby boomers and not at all among traditionalists. As a result, older Americans are now more likely to approve of the president than younger Americans are.\n\nThis analysis is based on aggregated Gallup poll data since Biden became president, dividing his presidency into three distinct periods defined by his average approval rating at the time.\n\nDuring the honeymoon phase of Biden's presidency, spanning January 2021 through June of that year, an average of 56% of Americans approved of how he was handling his job as president.\n\nThe first obvious decline in Biden's approval occurred in July and August 2021, when 49% of Americans, on average, approved.\n\nGallup interviewed roughly 6,000 adults in the first and third of these periods, and over 2,000 in the middle period.\n\nDuring Biden's honeymoon period, 60% of both Generation Z adults and millennials approved of the job he was doing, putting these groups above the national average approval rating. His support was below the national average among baby boomers (53%) and, especially, traditionalists (48%) early in his presidency.\n\nBy the summer, as coronavirus cases unexpectedly rose, Biden had lost significant support among Generation Z, millennials and Generation X, ranging from seven- to 10-percentage-point drops. But his approval rating held steady among baby boomers and traditionalists.\n\nAll generational groups have become less approving of Biden since the summer, after the troubled U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in late August 2021, with the exception of traditionalists, whose approval has not changed.\n\nTraditionalists are the only major demographic subgroup whose approval is similar now to what it was in the early part of Biden's presidency. A small number of other subgroups -- including some that have never been inclined to approve of Biden -- have modestly lower approval now, with declines of less than 10 percentage points. These include Republicans (down four points, from 10% to 6%), adults aged 65 and older (down five points), baby boomers (down seven points), political conservatives (down eight points) and 50- to 64-year-old adults (down nine points). The full data on changes in approval by all major subgroups can be found at the end of the article.\n\nOne reason older Americans are less likely to have changed their opinions of Biden during his time in office is that they are much more likely to identify politically as a Republican or a Democrat than as an independent.Approval ratings are more strongly linked to partisanshipnow than in the past. To date,approval of Biden among independents has declined morethan it has among Democrats or Republicans.\n\nOnly about one in four traditionalists (27%) and one in three baby boomers (34%) identify as political independents. This compares with roughly half of Americans among Generation X, millennials, and Generation Z. These figures are based on polls conducted throughout Biden's presidency; party identification within each generation has been relatively stable during that time.\n\nHowever, a greater share of political independents cannot by itself explain why older Americans show less change in their evaluations of Biden than younger generations do. Traditionalists and baby boomers who identify politically as Democrats or as independents show less change in approval than their political counterparts in the younger generations. For example, approval of Biden among millennials who identify as independents is down 24 points (from 59% to 35%) compared with a 14-point drop among baby boomers who identify as independents (from 54% to 40%). Millennial Democrats' approval has dropped 15 points (from 93% to 78%), compared with a five-point drop among baby boomer Democrats (from 96% to 91%).\n\nRepublicans' opinions of Biden have been highly fixed, and highly negative, regardless of their age or generation.\n\nIn addition to the 21-point decline in Biden job approval among Generation Z adults, and the slightly larger 23-point drop among 18- to 29-year-old adults, Black and Hispanic adults also show big drops.\n\nEarly in Biden's term, 87% of Non-Hispanic Black adults approved of the job he was doing. That fell to 74% in the summer of 2021 and is now at 67%, 20 points lower than in the early stages of his presidency.\n\nAmong Hispanics, Biden's job approval has slumped from 73% in early 2021 to 52% now, a 21-point fall.\n\nTo a significant degree, the bigger declines among Black and Hispanic adults have occurred because those subgroups started out at much higher levels of approval than other subgroups. Among Non-Hispanic White adults, Biden's approval rating has fallen 10 points but started out much lower, at 45%.\n\nEven though Biden's approval rating has dropped sharp..."}

But he warned that Russia would pay the ultimate price.\n\n“The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia’s costs will be so high that you will not be able to rise again for several generations,” he said.\n\nZelensky pointed to the 200,000 people reportedly at the Moscow rally as roughly the same number of Russian troops taking part in the invasion.\n\n“Picture for yourself that in that stadium in Moscow there are 14,000 dead bodies and tens of thousands more injured and maimed,” Zelensky said in the video shot outside the presidential office in the capital, Kyiv. “Those are the Russian costs throughout the invasion.”\n\nUkrainian and Russian officials agreed to establish 10 humanitarian corridors for bringing aid in and residents out — one from Mariupol, and several around Kyiv and in the eastern Luhansk region, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday.\n\nShe also announced plans to deliver humanitarian aid to Kherson, which was seized by Russian forces.\n\nVladimir Medinsky, who has led Russian negotiators in several rounds of talks with Ukraine, said the two sides are closer to agreement on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting a neutral status.

Votes are redistributed in an elimination process if no candidate commands a majority of first-choice votes.\n\nThe tally released Tuesday was intended to be only a partial count of in-person ballots from Election Day and early voting. The board has received tens of thousands of absentee ballots and was to begin counting those this week. Certified results weren't expected until later in July.\n\nA ranking of voters' first choices released June 22 on election night showed Adams in first place with a roughly 9-point lead over Wiley. Garcia trailed closely in third.\n\nAfter numerous elimination rounds clearing the crowded Democratic field, Adams remained in first, but Garcia was in second and Wiley in third. Wiley's elimination boosted Garcia even closer to Adams, though the former police captain still held on with 51% of the vote.\n\nAdams' campaign had previously raised concerns about the ranked choice voting system. When Garcia and Andrew Yang, the former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate turned mayoral hopeful, looked to campaign together days before the election, Adams' campaign allies tried to cast the alliance as voter disenfranchisement. Advocates of the system say such alliances are common.\n\nGarcia called Tuesday's error \"deeply troubling\" and said a \"transparent and complete explanation\" was needed. Wiley said it was \"not just a failure to count votes properly today, it is the result of generations of failures that have gone unaddressed.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Board of Elections did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nIf a candidate had won 50% of first-choice votes, that person would be the winner. Because that didn't happen, the ranked choice voting process kicks in.\n\nIn a series of elimination rounds, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and the votes for that candidate are redistributed based on how voters ranked their preferences. The process continues until two candidates are left, and the person with the most votes would win.\n\nNew Yorkers voted in a ballot initiative in 2019 to enact ranked choice voting for mayor and many other offices' primaries and special elections.\n\nThe system has been used in Oakland, California, and Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAdvocates said ranked voting better captures voters' preferences and can be less costly than runoff elections.\n\nWithout ranked choice, the city would probably be awaiting a runoff election that could cost millions, said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause/New York.\n\nExit pollingfrom Lerner's group found that voters took advantage of the new system. More than 80% of voters ranked at least two candidates in the mayoral primary, and more than 40% ranked five candidates.\n\nLerner stressed the delay in reporting results is not because of ranked voting but rather state laws protecting voters' rights around when absentee ballots can be counted and \"curing\" ballot defects.\n\n\"Democracy takes time, and it's important that every vote counts. Accurate results are worth waiting for,\" she said.\n\nOther closely watched elections using ranked choice voting included the race for city comptroller and several City Council seats.\n\nThe Republican primary featured only two candidates.

The accounts were created in April, October and November 2022, according to the report. Researchers used patterns in an account’s profile along with its follower list and posts to identify bots, which usually post “repetitive content about the same topics,” according to the report.\n\n“One account will say, ‘Biden is trying to take our guns; Trump was the best,’ and another will say, ‘Jan. 6 was a lie and Trump was innocent,’” Cyabra engineer Jules Gross told the AP. “Those voices are not people. For the sake of democracy I want people to know this is happening.”\n\nResearchers said one measure of bot impact is the number of posts about a topic by fake accounts. For an average topic, that number is in the low single digits, but nearly three-fourths of the negative posts about Haley were made by fake accounts, according to the report.\n\nThe bots have also focused on seeding the idea that DeSantis would be more fit to serve as Trump’s 2024 running mate than as president.\n\n“Our understanding of what is mainstream Republican sentiment for 2024 is being manipulated by the prevalence of bots online,” the Cyabra researchers concluded.\n\nThe news comes one month after astudyfrom the New York University Center for Social Media and Politics found Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election on Twitter reached relatively few users and had no measurable impact in changing minds or influencing voter behavior. Many Trump-critics and members of the mainstream media had suggested Trump’s 2016 win was the result of Russian meddling and that there was a sophisticated system of bots working to turn the tide in the Republican’s favor.\n\nSend a tip to the news team atNR.\n\n© 2025 National Review\n\nNewsletters\n\n© 2025 National Review"}

Apple plans to suspend sales of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 versions of its popular Apple Watch for online U.S. customers beginning Thursday afternoon, Dec. 21, 2023, and in its stores on Sunday, Dec. 24.

That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Apple, given that industry analysts are expecting the company to generate nearly $120 billion in sales this quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season.\n\nOn Oct. 26, the ITC determined that Apple infringed on two patents owned by Masimo Corp. and Cercacor Laboratories, both U.S. companies.

That outrage has led to progressive Democrats across America pushing reparations in cities, states and in Congress.\n\nReparations has always been a hard sell, but the Black Lives Matter movement has given it new impetus, and Democrats committed to social justice say the time is now.\n\nThey are walking on precarious ground.\n\nThe political fight they are courting in one of our bluest states might not bring the outcome they’re anticipating. In fact, it’s hard to see how it can at the levels of compensation they are now envisioning.\n\nA defeat for reparations in the nation’s most populous and diverse state could deliver a serious blow to the movement nationally and strike a death knell to the identity politics Democrats have practiced for decades.\n\nIn the Golden State, thepush for reparations began anew in 2020when its progressive governor, Gavin Newsom, created the Reparation Task Force.\n\nThat nine-member panel has been crisscrossing the state gathering data and will present its report with a proposed call for actionto the California Legislature next year.\n\nThis past week, the task force released its estimates forcompensation owed Black Californiansfor housing discrimination practices from 1933 to 1977. That potential price tag is $569 billion or $223,200 per person, The New York Times reports.\n\nExpensive. And on first impressions, a massive overreach.\n\nBut housing discrimination is only one price tag. The task force is considering four other areas of cash compensation:mass incarceration, unjust property seizures, devaluation of Black businesses and health care, The Times reports.\n\nBefore we even know these additional price tags, The Times is calling California’s reparations project “the nation’s most ambitious effort so far to compensate for the economic legacy of slavery and racism.”\n\nCalifornia would seem the ideal political climate to test such a proposal. Democrats have dominated the state for decades, and the Republican Party there is a spent force.\n\nFurther, California is the most diverse state in the country, withno race or ethnic group constituting a majority, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. California’s population is 40.2% Latino, 35.2% white, 16.4% Asian American or Pacific Islander, 6.5% Black and 1.7% Native American or Alaska Native,the U.S. Census reports.\n\nAsians, not Latinos, are nowthe fastest-growing ethnic group in the state, according to the Census.\n\nBut the numbers suggest California could become a serious roadblock to the concept of government paying marginalized groups for historic wrongs.\n\nReparations are deeply unpopular in America, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey. Sixty-eight percent of all Americans oppose them, while only 30% have expressed support.\n\nBlack Americans favor reparations by 77% to 17%, according to the Pew survey. But other groups, including white (18% to 80%), Hispanic (39% to 58%) and Asian (33% to 65%), are strongly opposed.\n\nWith such opposition from other larger ethnic groups and with Blacks underrepresented in the state (6.5% of the California population vs.13.6% nationally), blue state California might become a bulwark against reparations and the identity politics that inform it.\n\nIn fact, only two years ago, Californiansoverwhelmingly defeated ballot Proposition 16that would have allowed the state and local governments to use race and gender as factors in public college admissions, government jobs and contracting.\n\nThe outcome wasn’t close. The so-called affirmative action proposition went down by a margin of 57% to 43% despite proponents outspending opponents by 14 to 1. Golden State voters did this in the same year they were voting for Joe Biden for president, 64% to 34%.\n\nThe problem isn’t that Americans don’t recognize the historic evils of slavery and Jim Crow. Those are undeniable facts and represent some of the most important history we need to pass on to our children. Mankind should never forget its capacity for cruelty and repression, especially on a large scale.\n\nThe problem is that we live in an age of limited resources when we can’t afford to address all the problems of the present, let alone the past.\n\nCaliforniafaces a $25 billion budget deficit. “Tax revenues have fallen short of projections every month this fiscal year, and layoffs at marquee tech companies like Lyft, Meta and Twitter have heightened economic pessimism throughout the state,” Politico reports.\n\nMany economists are predicting 2023 will bring recession. That coupled with today’s inflation could gr..."}

It is what it is. That was automatically going to happen with the evidence mounted against him,” Talley said. “What would make me happy is if America acknowledges its racist history and the racism currently going on now.”\n\nGarnell Whitfield Jr., whose mother, Ruth Whitfield, was among the victims, said “my mother didn’t deserve this, none of these people deserved this.”\n\n“Until we humanize each other, until we are seen as human beings, until we are treated as equals, deserving of our breath, deserving of our lives, then nothing’s going to change,” he said.\n\n“What is America going to do about the cancer of white supremacy?

Flynn said the white supremacist gunman who shot and killed 10 Black people in a grocery store was the first person in the state of New York to be found guilty of domestic terrorism motivated by hate.\n\nThe charge carries an automatic sentence of life without parole, the highest penalty in the state.\n\nIn a news conference Monday, Flynn laid out the evidence that authorities had against the 19-year-old shooter.\n\nFlynn said the proof to the charges against the shooter would establish that the gunman “carried out a racially motivated attack fueled by white supremacist ideology, specifically targeting Black people.”\n\nThe shooting was captured on the store’s surveillance video as well as on a camera attached to a helmet that the shooter was wearing, which was used to live stream the attack.\n\nThat evidence “establishes beyond all doubt, the gruesome facts of the defendant’s conduct,” he said.\n\n“It also establishes beyond all doubt, as required by the hate-crime enhancement and the elements of the domestic terrorism act count, the equally gruesome motive behind the defendant’s conduct,” he said. “In just over two minutes, the defendant, with the intent to murder as many African Americans as he could, killed 10 innocent Black people and attempted to kill three others.”\n\nThe attorney for the 19-year-old white man who killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo grocery store said Monday that the gunman’s guilty plea “represents a condemnation of the racist ideology that fueled his horrific actions on May 14.”\n\nAttorney Brian Parker said that before his client is sentenced to life without the possibility of parole on Feb. 15, the families of the victims and those injured in the shooting would have the chance to address the court, the community and the gunman directly.\n\n“It is our hope that a final resolution of the state charges will help in some small way to keep the focus on the needs of the victims and the community,” Parker said late Monday morning.\n\nA 19-year-old man pleaded guilty Monday to a 25-count state indictment in the murders of 10 Black people in a racist mass shooting at the Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, New York, his attorney, Brian Parker, said.\n\nPayton Gendron appeared in Erie County Court Monday morning for the plea hearing.\n\nThe grand jury indicted him on charges of domestic terrorism motivated by hate, 10 counts of first-degree murder, charges of murder and attempted murder as a hate crime and weapons possession.\n\nThe domestic terrorism motivated by hate charge carries an automatic life sentence upon conviction.\n\n“It avoids..."}

They are all interlinked, rooted in a common effort to stoke extremism and political turmoil in pursuit of personal political power or wealth.\n\nThe most influential and vocal leaders of the “Make America Great Again” movement are in fact engaged in an endless effort to hide the truth from their most faithful followers.\n\nThese figures are united in a willingness to give the grassroots conservative base, already primed by Trump’s lies, what it wants to hear – whether it is voter fraud conspiracies in the 2020 election or that the riot at the Capitol did not take place. Election deniers’ continued sway in deep red parts of the country means there is still a strong constituency for such messages. But the poor performance of many such midterm candidates in swing states last fall suggests some voters usually open to voting Republican lack a true political home.\n\nRelated articleWhat to know about the Tucker Carlson January 6 footage\n\nStill, the political and monetary power of Trump’s conspiracy theory machine means US democracy, which barely survived under his first assault in 2020, is likely to face another extreme test over the next two years as he mounts his third White House bid.\n\nIt is hard to draw any other conclusion when Carlson – who has millions of viewers and the power to make the speaker of the House dance to his tune – as recently as Monday evening offered this completely false conclusion about the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s presidency: “In retrospect, it is clear that the 2020 election was a grave betrayal of American democracy.”\n\nBen Ginsberg, a long-time Republican election lawyer, drew an analogy between Carlson’s latest effort to hide the truth of the insurrection and Fox’s earlier efforts to promote conspiracies about the 2020 election to please its viewers – even though documents released from the Dominion suit show that the opinion hosts who fanned them didn’t believe them.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Erin Burnett, Ginsberg pointed to a “crass decision” that showed that “Fox was worried that if they told the truth that it would be financially damaging, if not ruinous to them, and by spreading the falsehoods, they were appealing to their audience and making money.” He also said the same calculation “plays into the Dominion lawsuit, but it also plays into the later reputational issues and what they have been saying about the elections.”\n\nIt is still to early to know whether the Fox case will go to trial, whether other evidence unearthed in the discovery process will be exculpatory or to know the full picture of the case.\n\nBut Ginsberg pointed out a core weakness in the network’s defense when he said: “There is still no credible evidence there was any fraud that could have possibly overturned the results of the election.”\n\nMcCarthy’s decision to hand access to the tapes to Carlson, who has a long record of conspiracy theories about January 6, 2021, reinforced an impression that he is seeking to discredit the findings of the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the insurrection when the chamber was under Democratic control over the last two years.\n\nAnd yet, in the wake of the mob assault on the Capitol, McCarthy had said Trump “bears responsibility.” McCarthy’s decision to hand over the footage to Carlson in an apparent bid to obscure the truth of the insurrection contrasts with his own views in the days after the riot, CNN’s KFile reported Tuesday. “They scaled walls,” McCarthy told KERN radio in his Bakersfield, California, area district. “They brought ropes. A couple of protesters died because they scaled. And when you have the inaugural, there was scaffolding. They were scaling the scaffolding. They, they overtook the place.”\n\nRelated article'They scaled walls, they brought ropes': House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's own words contradict January 6 footage used by Tucker Carlson\n\nMcCarthy told CNN’s Raju that his decision to release the footage was an act of “transparency” – even though no journalists other than Carlson got to see it. A GOP source told CNN’s Melanie Zanona last month that he gave an undertaking to do so to Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of the holdouts who threatened his bid to become speaker, but the apparent deal did not specify that Carlson should get the material. (McCarthy told reporters Tuesday that the footage would be released to all media organizations, but did not say when.)\n\nMcCarthy’s ..."}

Graham, too, said there appears to be interest from some of his GOP colleagues.\n\nThe House is planning to vote in June on a current version of a bill Blumenthal and Graham first introduced in 2018 after 17 people died in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That bill would allow law enforcement or family or household members of an individual threatening harm to themselves or others to petition federal district courts for extreme risk protection orders.\n\nSenators, however, are not focused on that measure since they don’t think it would get enough GOP support. Instead Blumenthal and Graham, along with other senators, are talking about retooling a bill they worked on in 2019 after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that would provide grants for states to implement red flag laws that would allow lower courts to issue extreme risk protection orders. The senators never publicly released that bill.\n\nRed flag laws allowing courts to impose extreme risk protection orders have already been enacted in 19 states, according toEverytown for Gun Safety, an activist group.\n\n“There are a variety of state laws. Our bill sets standards for them so they are effective, and provides incentives for adoption,” Blumenthal said.\n\nBlumenthal and fellow Connecticut DemocratChristopher S. Murphyhave led their party’s efforts on gun safety since the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting that took 26 lives rocked their state and the nation nearly a decade ago.\n\nThey and other Democrats are clear that this latest shooting may not change enough Republicans’ minds about the need for federal legislation, but they want to give it a try.\n\n“We are under no illusions that this will be easy. We have been burned in the past when Republicans promised to debate, only for them to break their promise,” Senate Majority LeaderCharles E. Schumersaid in floor remarks Thursday. “But even with long odds, the issue is so important, so raw to the American people, so personal to countless families who have missing children, that we must pursue that opportunity.”\n\nSchumer said Murphy, Blumenthal and other Democrats, including Sens.Chris Coonsof Delaware,Martin Heinrichof New Mexico andJoe Manchin IIIof West Virginia, are holding talks with Republicans on potential solutions, but they’re not willing to negotiate indefinitely.\n\n“If these negotiations do not bear any fruit, the Senate will vote on gun safety legislation when we return” from Memorial Day recess, Schumer said.\n\nMurphy hosted meetings with senators in the Capitol on Thursday and said he plans to continue the negotiations over the break. While he sought to avoid predicting what legislative proposals, if any, would be successful, he confirmed the bipartisan interest in incentivizing states to implement red flag laws.\n\n“The red flag laws are better administered at the state level. There have been some proposals for federal court red flag laws. I’m not sure that that’s the way to go,” Murphy said. “So I have no problem incentivizing state red flag laws. … Those systems aren’t cheap to implement, but they are frequently used.”\n\nSome Republicans involved in the discussions are pointing to their home state laws as good models to look at when drafting federal standards that would be tied to any grant funding.\n\n“I told [Murphy] about Maine’s yellow flag law that has due process involving different medical professionals,” Maine GOP Sen.Susan Collinssaid. “I really think our focus should be on looking at what some states have done on red flag or yellow flag laws.”\n\nFlorida Republican Sen.Rick Scottsaid his state enacted its red flag law in response to the Parkland shooting when he was governor and law enforcement has made good use of it since. He said he’s open to federal guidelines for other states that want to enact similar laws, so long as it provides due process for gun owners and protection orders are temporary, not permanent.\n\nMurphy and Scott had a conversation Wednesday about the Florida law and how Scott got that passed.\n\n“The Florida red flag law  is a pretty high bar,” Murphy said. “Parents can’t do it, only law enforcement.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Joe Biden Biden Signs Bill Averting Rail Strike Praises Economic Outlook", "output": "PresidentJoe Bidensigned a bill into law making a rail strike illegal, preventing workers from walking off the job weeks before the holiday season.\n\n\"The bill I'm about to sign ends a difficult rail dispute and helps our nation avoid what, without a doubt, would have been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar,\" Biden said Friday morning before signing the bill.\n\nAfter his administration aided in negotiations for months, and the sides reached a tentative agreement in September, talks ultimately stalled and rail workers threatened a strike. Biden then asked Congress to intervene, and theSenate passed a billThursday making a strike illegal.\n\nThe initial agreement brokered by the Biden administration was accepted by all but four rail unions, who were holding out for guaranteed paid sick leave days. The opposing unions, though, represent the majority of rail workers. The workers and companies had until Dec. 9 to reach an agreement before they vowed to strike, which the industry estimated would cost the U.S. economy $2 billion per day.\n\n\"Our nation's rail system is literally the backbone of our supply chain,\" Biden said Friday. \"So much of what we rely on is delivered on rail, from clean water to food and gas and every other good. A rail shutdown would have devastated our economy. Without freight rail, many of our industries would have literally shut down.\"\n\nA strike by rail workers so close to the holiday season — and in a period of high inflation — could potentially raze the economy. Biden was adamant that Congress send the legislation to his desk by Saturday. Without an agreement, rail movement of certain goods was set to be curtailed as soon as this weekend in preparation for the strike.\n\nBiden at the bill signing Friday said his economic advisors told him as many as 765,000 Americans, \"many of them union members themselves,\" would have lost their jobs.\n\nRailroad carriers begin prepping for a strike seven days in advance, according to federal safety measures. The carriers start to prioritize the securing and movement of sensitive materials such as chlorine for drinking water and hazardous materials.\n\nNinety-six hours before a strike date, chemicals are no longer transported. The American Chemistry Council found adrop of 1,975 carloadsof chemical shipments during the week of Sept. 10, when the railroads stopped accepting shipments due to the previous threat of a rail strike.\n\nThe four major railroads also typically move more than 80% of the agricultural freight traffic, according to the National Grain and Feed Association.\n\nCongress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce under Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court has ruled it can use that authority to intervene in disputes by rail labor that have the potential to affect trade across state lines. A nearly century-old law, the Railway Labor Act of 1926, gives the president the authority to intervene as well in situations where a rail strike could significantly affect essential transportation. The act has been invoked 18 times since it was signed into law.\n\nTheHouse on Wednesdayapproved a separate measure that would have added seven days of paid sick leave to the contract instead of just one. Though it had bipartisan support in both chambers,that measure was defeated in the Senate vote. Biden at the bill signing thanked Congress for acting so quickly even though he acknowledged it wasn't an easy vote.\n\n\"I know this was a tough vote for members of both parties. It was a tough vote for me,\" Biden said. \"But it was the right thing to do at the moment to save jobs, to protect millions of working families from harm and disruption and to keep the supply chain stable around the holidays.\"\n\nThe situation put \"union Joe\" Biden in a difficult position. Biden said Thursday he supports unions as much as ever, but as president of the United States, rather than a single senator from Delaware, it was his job to look out for all Americans. He said has long been a proponent of paid sick leave, and will still work to make it a right for all workers, not just rail workers.\n\nThe initial agreement brokered by the White House would give rail workers a 24% pay increase over five years from 2020 through 2024, immediate payouts averaging $11,000 upon ratification. Under the agreement, workers would receive one extra paid day off and the promise they could attend medical appointments without penalty.\n\nWorkers, though, balked at the lack of paid sick leave, because under the agreement they would have to use unpaid time off for medical appointments. Biden on Friday acknowledged his disappointment that paid sick leave was not included in the agreement.\n\n\"Look, I know this bill doesn't have paid sick leave that these workers, frankly every worker in America, deserves, but that fight isn't over,\" Biden said. \"I didn't commit we were going to stop, that just because we couldn't get it into this bill that we were going to stop fighting f..."}

They have viewed his foreign interventions with growing concern, especially the human cost of the war in Yemen.\n\nBut it was the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi that tipped the scales: it dramatically increased support for the resolution to withdraw US military support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, something that failed to pass earlier in the year. Many senators saw the Khashoggi killing as the blatantly egregious act of an ally that felt immune from rebuke.\n\nAnd they were dismayed when the administration stood staunchly by the prince without censure, even though the CIA concluded he probably ordered the killing. Senators want to see the administration shape the alliance as the senior partner, and enforce red lines.\n\nSenior Republican Senator Bob Corker noted recently that much of the bipartisan activism in the Senate had been fuelled by a perception that there is no balance between values and interests in the administration's policies.\n\nPresident Trump has vowed to veto the measure, and it is unlikely right now to pass the House of Representatives, which on Wednesday blocked a vote on the matter.\n\nBut Senator Sanders said he expects the resolution to succeed once Democrats formally take over control of the House in January following their mid-term elections victory.\n\nThe Trump administration had argued the bill would undercut US support for the Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nWhite House officials have emphasised US economic ties to the kingdom. Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has continued to cultivate ties with the prince, according to the US media.\n\nA ceasefire agreed by the warring parties on Thursday has come into effect in the country's main port, Hudaydah.\n\nAfterthe deal was reached in Sweden, negotiators for both parties shook hands to applause, though they later expressed scepticism.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he hoped this would be the starting point to bring nearly four years of civil strife to a close.\n\nSince hostilities began in 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed, and around 14 million people have been pushed to the brink of starvation, according to the UN.\n\nSaudi Arabia buys the bulk of its weapons from the US, Britain and France.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.\n\nIn an opening statement to the House Oversight Committee, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen accuses his former client of knowing about the Roger Stone-WikiLeaks plot but denies 'direct evidence' of Russia collusion.\n\nIn his testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday,Michael Cohenwill accuse his former client, President Trump, of knowing that his adviserRoger Stonewas reaching out to WikiLeaks concerning the publication of stolen Democratic National Committee emails.\n\nBut Cohen apparently will not claim Trump directed those communications, and Cohen will specifically assert that he lacks direct evidence of improper collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia -- a significant admission, given Cohen's longtime status as the president's former top lawyer and fixer.\n\nREAD COHEN'S REMARKS\n\n\"Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia,\" Cohen will testify. \"I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions.\"\n\nIn his prepared remarks,which were obtained by Fox News and first reported by Politico, Cohen will additionally point to what he will call an \"unusual\" episode in Trump Tower in approximately June 2016, when Donald Trump, Jr. supposedly whispered about a \"meeting\" in Trump's ear -- followed allegedly by Trump's reply, \"Ok, good. Let me know.\"\n\nTrumphas maintainedthat he did not know in advance about the meeting -- backing up Trump Jr., who told the Senate Judiciary Committee the same thing in September 2017 and would face potential criminal liability if he were lying. But the administration haschanged its accountingof whether Trump was personally involved in drafting a response to media reports about the meeting.\n\nSeveral Justice Department officials have told Fox News that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation is close to wrapping up; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports.\n\nEarly Wednesday, President Trump tweeted that Cohen was \"lying in order to reduce his prison time,\" and referred to published reports that Cohen had been disbarred by the New York State Supreme Court -- reports that have not been independently confirmed by Fox News.\n\nThe president was tweeting from Hanoi, Vietnam -- where he is attending a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nAccording to Cohen, \"nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump’s knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to thatJune 2016 Trump Tower meetingabout dirt on 18 Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad’s desk that day.\"\n\nCohen is slated to outline a slew of other alleged misdeeds by Trump, including lying about his total assets to reduce his taxes and even trying to strongarm academic officials into keeping his SAT scores secret.\n\nIn a text message to the Washington Post, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani strongly denied Cohen's reported claims, and pointed toCohen's release of secret audio tapesof his conversations with Trump as evidence that Cohen can't be trusted.\n\n\"It's pathetic,\"Giuliani said. \"This is a lawyer who tapped his own client when he claimed he was being loyal. If you believe him you are a fool. He bragged he was connected to Russian organized crime and he may be. His father-in-law, who gave him millions [to invest], was convicted of tax fraud in a money-laundering operation. Let's see if these Democrats want to ask him about his many crimes having nothing to do with anyone but his coterie of business associates with questionable connections.\"\n\n\"If you believe him you are a fool.\"\n\nIn perhaps the most significant portions of his opening statement, according to the transcript, Cohen tells Congress that Trump \"was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.\"\n\nStone, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into possible Russian collusion by the Trump campaign.\n\nFILE - In this Dec. 12, 2018, file photo, Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, leaves federal court after his sentencing in New York.

Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told reporters Friday.\n\n“This strike was taken in the earnest belief that it would prevent an imminent threat to forces at the airport,” McKenzie said. “Our investigation now concludes that the strike was a tragic mistake.”\n\nThe news comes as the Biden administration is already facing criticism over its Afghanistan withdrawal and the fact that the effort left hundreds of Americans and thousands of at-risk Afghans in the country at the end of August. More than 120,000 people were airlifted from Hamid Karzai International Airport before U.S. troops pulled out.\n\nThe revelation also comes one week after aNew York Times investigation determined the target actually worked for an American aid organization.\n\nCentral Command ordered the Aug. 29 strike based on intelligence that the man was planning an “imminent” attack on the airport, where the military was scrambling to evacuate tens of thousands of American citizens and at-risk Afghans before the clock ran out on the withdrawal.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in early September called the strike “righteous.”\n\nBut instead, the strike “tragically” killed “as many as 10 civilians,” including up to seven children, McKenzie said.\n\nMilley on Friday acknowledged the mistake, calling the “heart wrenching” strike “a horrible tragedy of war.”\n\n“In a dynamic high threat environment, the commanders on the ground had appropriate authority and had reasonable certainty that the target was valid,” Milley said in a statement. “But after deeper post strike analysis our conclusion is that innocent civilians were killed.”\n\nMcKenzie on Friday stood by the intelligence the military used to determine the target, noting the threat to the airport was posed by a “white Toyota Corolla,” the same type of car that was destroyed in the strike, and that the military had “no indication that the strike would result in civilian casualties.”\n\nThe strike must be considered “in the context of the situation on the ground,” McKenzie said, adding that just days before an ISIS-K suicide bombing had killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 civilians at the airport.\n\nIn the 48 hours before the strike, the military had “a substantial body of intelligence” indicating that there would be another attack, and one recurring theme was that ISIS-K would use a white Toyota Corolla as a key element, McKenzie said.\n\nBased on that intelligence, the military began surveilling the car belonging to the target, identified as Zemari Ahmadi, the morning of the strike, and continued observing its movements for eight hours, McKenzie said.\n\nThe strike was executed at 4:53 p.m. that afternoon because the military determined there was little potential for civilian casualties, McKenzie said. That assessment turned out to be wrong, he acknowledged.\n\nMcKenzie declined to comment as to whether anyone will be disciplined over the strike, noting that the investigation is ongoing. “I have nothing for you now because that involves personnel issues,” he said.\n\nLoading\n\nYou will now start receiving email updates\n\nPlease check your inbox for a confirmation email\n\nYou are already subscribed\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nFree through the end of 2025, this POLITICO Pro newsletter preview explores the people, policies, and power shifts shaping today’s international security landscape.\n\nBy signing up, you acknowledge and agree to ourPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Service.

That he could roll into a sovereign nation, and the world would roll over. That he could shake the foundations of security in Europe and beyond,” Mr.Bidensaid.\n\nInstead, Mr.Bidenadded, Mr. Putin confronted a determinedUkraine, and NATO is “stronger, larger, and more united than ever.”\n\nYet there are increasing signs Kyiv will be unable to resist Mr. Putin’s invaders in perpetuity.\n\nMr.BidensaidUkraineis “running out of ammunition” and will be unable to hold the line against Russian forces who are aided by North Korea and Iran.\n\nThe president scolded the Republican-led House for failing to take up a Senate-passed supplemental bill that includes $60 billion in aid forUkraine.\n\nThe U.S. has provided more than $75 billion already. Some lawmakers say there is no clear plan for a Ukrainian victory so it doesn’t make sense to throw more American treasure at the effort or to help more Ukrainian soldiers to die in what is a never-ending stalemate.\n\nMr.Bidendefended the package, saying it would bolster the U.S. industrial base and send a critical message to Mr. Putin if he tries to mess with nations beyondUkraine.\n\n“History is watching,” he said. “The failure to supportUkraineat this critical moment will not be forgotten. Now is the time for us to stand strong withUkraineand stand united with our Allies and partners.”\n\nIf Mr. Putin “does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going,” Mr.Bidensaid. “And the costs to the United States — along with our NATO Allies and partners in Europe and around the world — will rise.”\n\n• Tom Howell Jr. can be reached atthowell@washingtontimes.com.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Washington Times, LLC.Click\n                            here for reprint permission.\n\nAI may be killing jobs; will it pay off?\n\nThe war against Christians\n\nFix immigration policy to rid the U.S. of enemies"}

Jassy wrote on Monday that the hiring “made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole.” “However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount,” he added.\n\nIn a separate memo to Twitch staffers on Monday, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy confirmed that the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform was letting go of some 400 employees.\n\n“Like many companies, our business has been impacted by the current macroeconomic environment, and user and revenue growth has not kept pace with our expectations,” Clancy wrote. “In order to run our business sustainably, we’ve made the very difficult decision to shrink the size of our workforce.”\n\nJust last week, Facebook-parent Meta said it was laying offan additional 10,000 workers,on top of the 11,000 job cuts announced late last year.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

County, like the rest of the state and nation, has for months been battling the latest wave of the coronavirus, which has been fueled by the highly infectious Delta variant.\n\nThough there are indications that the latest surge is losing some steam, officials are already turning a wary eye to the fall and winter, when the busy holiday season will bring people together from all over and colder weather will increasingly push gatherings and recreation indoors.\n\n“This is a reasonable path forward that will position us to be better able to break the cycle of surges,” Ferrer said during Wednesday’s L.A. County Board of Supervisors meeting.\n\nAbout 67% of Angelenos have already been at least partially inoculated against COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAround L.A., some businesses are asking for proof of vaccination against COVID-19 to enter. Here’s what you need to know about vaccination records.\n\nUnder the new order, participants and workers at outdoor “mega events” with more than 10,000 attendees will also need toprovide proof of vaccinationor show that they’ve recently tested negative for the coronavirus, starting Oct. 7. That requirement is already in place for indoor events of at least 1,000 people.\n\nFerrer said county health officials were also strongly recommending, though not requiring, vaccination verification at indoor portions of restaurants.\n\nThe county’s requirement that residents wear masks in indoor public settings will remain in place, she added.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe requirement will apply to everyone 12 and older and goes into effect for customers on Sept. 22.\n\nL.A. County is the most populous jurisdiction in California to announce a COVID-19 vaccination requirement to enter certain types of businesses.\n\nThe order would affect all areas of L.A.

Newsom in the recall election, and vice versa, analysis of voting data shows.\n\nThe L.A. City Councilis considering its own lawto require customers of indoor restaurants and gyms to have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. City attorneys are drafting a proposed ordinance.\n\nWhen asked about L.A. County’s move during a briefing Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said state officials “believe in localism and want to support local health decisions.”\n\nThough conditions could change, he indicated that the state had no immediate plans to follow suit.\n\nLately, the state has seen promising declines in case rates and the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized, but Newsom pointed out that it “was around this time last year we started to see that stabilization and decline as well, yet to experience that winter surge.”\n\n“We need to be vigilant,” he told reporters. “Of course, the best way to mitigate that ... is to continue our vaccine efforts, and if this encourages more people to get vaccinated, then I believe it’s the right thing to do, and I continue to encourage others to follow that path.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nWest Hollywood officials issued an emergency order Friday that will require the public to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination in order to enter some businesses beginning in October.\n\nAbout a month ago, Los Angeles County was averaging around 3,400 new coronavirus cases a day over a weekly period.

His rage reached a boil and he had a heated exchange of words with the woman. A police officer, there to keep the peace in the meeting, pulled on his arm. Smith yanked it away. Before he knew it, Smith says, he was hit in the face, handcuffed, and dragged across the floor, with his pants pulled down. Images of the incident were splashed on televisions and newspapers across the world.\n\nButa Biberaj, the county’s progressive, top elected prosecutor, who has close ties to the school board’s most liberal members, appeared in court to personally prosecute Smith for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Biberaj ran on a platform of ending “mass incarceration,” but she wanted to put Smith in jail for the misdemeanors.\n\nAs prosecutor, Biberaj would have known about the case involving Smith’s daughter. The suspect, juvenile court prosecutors assured Smith, was being held responsible: He was on house arrest, confined to his mother’s townhouse. According to Lancaster, a conviction was expected on October 14, likely in the form of a guilty plea to a lesser sexual assault charge.\n\nBut on October 6, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, a 15-year-old was charged with sexual battery and abduction after police said he forced a girl into an empty classroom, held her against her will, and touched her inappropriately.\n\nLancaster says the suspect is the same boy that allegedly attacked Smith’s daughter.\n\nWhat follows, based on extensive exclusive reporting from Loudoun County, is Smith’s experience. It is a story the school system and media were never going to tell.\n\nOn May 28, Stone Bridge High School called Smith to come to the school, where they told him that his 15-year-old daughter had just been physically assaulted in a bathroom by a male, Smith says. When he arrived, he determined that what had happened was not a case of his daughter being beaten up: It was far more serious.\n\nThe school said it was handling the incident in-house, he says. Smith was dumbfounded.\n\nDeputies from the sheriff’s office ultimately responded to the school –notto investigate the alleged rape of a child, Smith said, but because school administrators called them onhimfor making a scene about it.\n\nSmith acknowledges he did make a scene and says any father would have done the same in the situation. “I went nuts.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.\n\nAfter a briefing with the Senate, the secretary of state says a resolution limiting U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war following the death of Jamal Khashoggi would undermine cease-fire efforts.\n\nAfter Saudi operatives brutally murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in October, the Senate is rightly reviewing U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, including debating U.S. involvement with the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen conflict. Not enough attention, however, is being given to Iran’s direct responsibility for the suffering, violence and tragedy in Yemen.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Yemen is staggering. The ongoing conflict between the Saudi-supported, internationally-recognized government in Yemen, and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels,reportedlyhas claimed over 57,000 lives, driven half of Yemen’s 28 million people to the cusp of famine, and displaced 2.3 million Yemenis from their homes.\n\nThe U.S. has powerful interests not only in ending Yemen’s humanitarian crisis, but also in stopping Iran and its Shi’a terrorist proxies, as well as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), ISIS-Yemen, and other Sunni terrorists, from establishing permanent footholds from which they can threaten our nation and our forces in the region.\n\nIn Yemen, as in Syria, Iran is ruthlessly pursuing malign hegemony with no regard for innocent lives. The Iranian regimeis using arms transfers, training and terrorist proxiesto empower Houthi rebels, terrorize Yemeni civilians, undermine the security of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and challenge U.S. national security interests in the region.\n\nHouthi rebels have used Iranian-supplied advanced arms in the Yemen conflict,indiscriminately launchingover 100 ballistic missiles against Saudi cities, unleashing explosive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Saudi civilian targets, and deploying explosive boats and anti-ship missiles against commercial ships in the Arabian Gulf.\n\nMoreover, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have detained thousands of Yemenis andreportedly subjectedmany of them to “extreme torture – being smashed in their faces with batons, hung from chains by their wrists or genitals for weeks at a time, and scorched with acid.”\n\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah terroristshave provided training and supportthat have greatly increased the lethality and combat effectiveness of Houthi rebels, and enhanced their ability to threaten Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, international shipping in the Gulf, and U.S. forces in the region. Even if Iranian weapons are somehow cut off, the Houthi rebels’ combat-experience and training will persist for decades.\n\nWhile the United States is right to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for Khashoggi’s barbaric murder, we must also squarely face Iran’s central role in perpetuating Yemen’s conflict. Failure to do so risks yielding more war, oppression and misery in the region over the long term.\n\nBut speaking honestly about Iran’s direct responsibility for Yemen’s tragic conflict does not mean we must ignore the counter-productive actions that Saudi Arabia has sometimes taken.\n\nWhile the Saudis must answer for Khashoggi’s murder, congressional efforts to limit or end U.S. cooperation with the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks emboldening Iran and increasing the suffering of the Yemeni people. “[W]e can only help influence a positive outcome in Yemen by engaging with our partners,” then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Robert Karem toldCongress in April 2018. “Our support shows we take seriously our partners’ struggle against a real security threat to the region – thereby strengthening our broader argument that only a political solution will end the conflict.”\n\nThe Saudis’ lack of institutional accountability and lax military culture have contributed to civilian deaths in Yemen. The U.S. must do more to enforce the Saudis’ understanding and application of the Laws of Armed Conflict. Targets must be more carefully vetted, and the Saudi military must do all that it can to avoid harming innocents and to allow for food and humanitarian aid to reach suffering civilians.\n\nI strongly support a political end to Yemen’s conflict as soon as possible, in large part because the Yemeni people don’t have the benefit of time. However, any negotiation that ends in the Houthis taking part in a future government would serve to formalize an Iranian-Yemeni security relationship, harm our long-term security interests, and provide a strong incentive for the Iranian regime to cause other confl..."}

Elizabeth Warren took the rare step Monday of releasing her DNA test results examining her possible Native American ancestry, tries to eliminate critics' line of attack against her.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren took the rare step Monday of releasing DNA test results examining her possible Native American ancestry, in apparent response to persistent criticism from President Trump and other Republicans.\n\nThe results, as shared withThe Boston Globe, reportedly reveal “strong evidence” the Massachusetts senator had a Native American ancestor dating back six to 10 generations. At the same time, the report could embolden critics by showing only trace amounts of that heritage -- which Republicans have charged she used to advance her career at Harvard.\n\nAccording tothe analysis, if Warren’s great-great-great-grandmother were Native American, she would be considered 1/64 Native American. Should Warren’s ancestor date back 10 generations, she would be only 1/1,024 Native American. (The newspaper originally pegged the figures as 1/32 and 1/512, but in a correction that didn't do Warren any favors, later added a note saying, \"Due to a math error, a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of a potential 6th to 10th generation relative. The generational range based on the ancestor that the report identified suggests she’s between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American.\")\n\n\"To put that in perspective, Warren might even be less Native American than the average European American,\" Republican National Committee Deputy Communications Director Mike Reed said in an email, while saying this would \"not give you the right to claim minority status.\"\n\nBut as Warren mulls a presidential run in 2020, her Senate re-election campaign produced a video playing up the results.\n\nIn it, Warren says: “The president likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?”\n\nStanford University Professor Carlos D. Bustamante replies: “The facts suggest that you absolutely have Native American ancestry in your pedigree.”\n\nBustamante, according to the Globe, authored the six-page report and conducted the analysis after Warren released a sample of her DNA to a private lab in Georgia over the summer. Warren did not use a commercial service for her DNA analysis, according to The Globe, but rather Bustamante, who is on the scientific advisory board for Ancestry. He also worked on projects for other commercial services like 23andMe.\n\nBustamante found that “the vast majority” of Warren’s family tree is European, but added that “the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor ... in the range of 6-10 generations ago.”\n\nWarren has been repeatedly criticized by Trump over her heritage claims—including last week at a rally, when he once again used his “Pocahontas” nickname for her.\n\n“I’ve got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas, and I have none,” Trump said. “Hey, I have high cheekbones too, maybe I’m Indian.”\n\nOver the summer, Trump said that if Warren did mount a presidential run in 2020 and the two faced off in a general election debate, he would offer $1 million to her favorite charity on the spot if she took a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage.\n\nThe DNA results report could, at least, eliminate that as a line of attack.\n\nTrump, though, brushed off Warren's DNA test when asked about it Monday morning, while claiming he never made the million-dollar offer (he did, at a rally over the summer).\n\n\"Who cares?\" Trump said. \"I didn't say that. You better read it again.\"\n\nTrump added that he \"hopes\" Warren runs for president.\n\n\"I think she'd be very easy. I do not think she'd be difficult at all. She'll destroy the country. She'll make our country into Venezuela,\" Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. \"It's going to be a long process for the Democrats.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Warren used the Globe report to directly respond to Trump's challenge.\n\n\"By the way,@realDonaldTrump: Remember saying on 7/5 that you’d give $1M to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry? I remember – and here's the verdict. Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center,\" Warren tweeted, including a link to the group's website.\n\nWarren for years has been accused of exaggerating her Native American heritage to help get a job as a Harvard law professor. Last month, the Globe reported that her heritage was not considered by Harvard Law faculty when analyzing her application in the 1990s. The report also said that her race was not considered when she applied to work at Rutgers University, the University of Houston,..."}

He did not, as theGuardiandeclared, help pass a bill, let alone an \"extreme\" one that would permit police to seize women's menstrual histories.\n\nTheGuardianheadline got the facts of the case wholly wrong. In any case, panic over Youngkin's role in tabling the state Senate bill is undermined by the fact that state lawdoes not permitlaw enforcement to prosecute patients who violate abortion restrictions, so menstrual data would be of little use for police looking to target women. And Youngkin has explicitly ruled out pursuing women for prosecution, with his spokeswoman telling theWashington Post, \"The governor will not support any measures that seek to prosecute women.\"\n\nMore than just bungling the facts, theGuardiancommitted the serious offense of disseminating misinformation in the public sphere. The outlet's four tweets featuring the false headline have not been deleted, and theGuardiandid not issue a correction after stealth-editing the headline in theoriginal article.\n\nSadly, the damage was already done.

But some critics say the railroad should be doing more to address those health concerns instead of worrying so much about economic recovery in the area.\n\nAnd the details are still tentative because the Ohio Attorney General’s office is still negotiatingan agreementthat will create a long-term fund to compensate homeowners along with two other funds to pay for any health problems or water contamination issues that crop up down the road. The Attorney General’s office said it’s not clear when those funds will be finalized because of all the unanswered questions at this stage.\n\nAlready, the railroad estimates that the cleanup will cost more than$800 million, which includes $74 million that Norfolk Southern has pledged to East Palestine to help the town recover. That total will continue to grow as the cleanup continues, the funds are finalized and various lawsuits move forward. The railroad will also get compensation from its insurers and likelyother companiesinvolved in the derailment.\n\n“This is another step in fulfilling our promise to East Palestine to make it right.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has not indicated when or if he’ll bring up the bill, but House Democrats are confident.\n\n“I have no reason to believe Leader Schumer won’t bring this bill to the floor,” said Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat.\n\nThe bill would replace Taney, the fifth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, with a bust of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first black person to serve on the high court.\n\nThe proposal also calls to remove statues of Charles Brantley Aycock, John Caldwell Calhoun, and James Paul Clarke, who all espoused white supremacy.\n\nIn some cases, states have already begun replacing the statues, but the effort takes years.\n\nInstead, Republicans argued Tuesday that Congress should reform the lengthy process for states to replace the two statues they dedicate to stand in the Capitol. Rep. Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, questioned the bill’s timing and pointed to “decades of inaction” by Democratic House majorities to remove the statues.\n\nFoxx said the congressional panel overseeing the statues moves too slowly, noting a request by North Carolina officials to replace the Aycock statue with the late Rev. Billy Graham “has been awaiting action” for months, suggesting more substantial reforms are in order.\n\nBut Democrats said it is more important to relocate the statues immediately where they can no longer be viewed by the public who visit the Capitol.\n\n“While that process is ongoing, these individuals are on a pedestal,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat. “And we cannot forget our history, but we do not have to put segregationists and pro-slavery historical figures on a pedestal. We don’t have to honor them, while we do have to remember them.”\n\nAycock was a prominent Democrat and North Carolina governor from 1901-1905. He promoted white supremacy and keeping black Americans suppressed and disenfranchised.\n\nClarke, another Democrat, was the former governor of Arkansas and a senator from 1903-1916. He was also a white supremacist.\n\nArkansas officials have already taken steps to replace the Clarke statue in the Capitol and another statue of Uriah Milton Rose. The figures will be replaced with statues of musician Johnny Cash and Daisy Lee Gatson Bates, a member of the “Little Rock Nine,” a group of black students who attended a newly integrated school in the 1950s.\n\nCalhoun’s likeness can be spotted in several locations in the Capitol. He’s memorialized in a marble bust and a portrait in the Senate, as well as a statue designed by South Carolina in the lower level of the Capitol.\n\nCalhoun, who served as vice president and a senator, openly embraced white supremacy and slavery.\n\nA bust of Taney is located in the Senate, inside the Old Supreme Court Chamber. Taney authored the 1857Dred Scott v. Sanforddecision declaring black people were not citizens.\n\nRepublicans accused Democrats of trying to rid the building of key historical figures who embraced racist views and also happened to be Democrats.\n\nHoyer rejected the charge in a press conference with reporters on Tuesday.\n\n“This is not about forgetting history or blurring history, but it’s saying we will not honor in the halls of Congress, either pictures, statues, or busts that give rise to a sense that they are being honored when they dishonored democracy and human rights,” he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nHouse Democrats included a provision to remove the statues in the 2022 Legislative Branch spending bill, a must-pass measure that has to be compromised with the Senate.\n\nNotifications"}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Us Reacts Texas Gops New Platform", "output": "Broadly speaking, the Republican Party has made tremendous strides when it comes to gay acceptance over the last decade. In fact, a strong majority of GOP voters nowsupport anti-discrimination protectionsfor gay people, and aslim majoritynow support same-sex marriage as well. But this progress has been uneven, and in some places, intolerance and bigotry still reign within the GOP.\n\nTexas is the prime example, unfortunately. The Texas state GOP just made waves for its decision toprohibitthe Texas Log Cabin Republicans, a group representing LGBT Republicans, from having a booth at its convention. This decision is counterproductive and backward. A party truly about individual freedom and liberty should have room in its tent for both religious conservatives with traditional views on homosexuality and gay Republicans.\n\nWhat’s more, a political party’s job is to win elections, and the Texas GOP is openly rejecting a group that wants to support them, agrees with them on most issues, and wants to defeat the Democrats, all because they can’t stomach the thought of having gay people in their party.\n\nI wonder how that will play out with LGBT voters in the next state election?\n\n“It’s clear that inclusion wins, which makes the Texas Republican Party leadership’s decision to exclude the Texas Log Cabin Republicans from their convention not just narrow-minded, but politically short-sighted,” Log Cabin Republicans President Charles Moransaid.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. also condemned the Texas GOP’s counterproductive decision.\n\n“The Texas GOP should focus its energy on fighting back against the radical Democrats and weak RINOs currently trying to legislate our 2nd Amendment rights away, instead of canceling a group of gay conservatives who are standing in the breach with us,” hesaid.\n\nThey’re both right. But arguably much worse than the party’s unjustified decision to prohibit Log Cabin is the anti-gay, archaic language in its latestplatform:\n\n“Homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle choice. We believe there should be no granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavior, regardless of state of origin, and we oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values.”\n\nThere are so many problems with this.\n\nWhether homosexuality is “abnormal” depends on what the Texas GOP means. It is not the norm, sure, but roughly1 in 14 adultsself-identify as LGBT. (Amuch higher percentageadmit to same-sex attraction.) Whether something is typical or not isn’t worthy of any moral judgment. Left-handed people are uncommon but in no meaningful way inferior to right-handed people.\n\nAs for whether gay people deserve “special legal entitlements,” all we’re actually asking for is equal rights granted to religious people. It is illegal to discriminate on the basis of religion, which actually is a choice, and all gay people want is the same rights for homosexuality, which is more akin to an inherent characteristic such as race than it is religion.\n\nThe Texas GOP platform goes on to talk about marriage, saying, “We affirm God’s biblical design for marriage and sexual behavior between one biological man and one biological woman.” This seems weird and improper. Politics in America is supposed to be about the role of government and public policy, with religious differences left to civic life.\n\nHere’s how I would rewrite the Texas GOP’s platform on this issue:\n\n“We believe that in America, gay people and traditionalist people of faith can live side-by-side despite holding fundamentally different beliefs. LGBT Americans and religious Americans should enjoy equal rights, and neither should have their fundamental right to liberty infringed upon. We believe the government should stay out of the marriage business and that different churches should be able to decide for themselves what definition of marriage they will embrace and not be forced in either direction.”\n\nOf course, I’m not a Texan. But party platforms are written by delegates, who tend to be hyperactive political people much more extreme than the average party member. So I suspect the Texas GOP’s stance on these issues is almost certainly more extreme than the average Texan would agree with and even probably significantly to the right of most Texas Republicans. But I know for a fact that it iswildly unrepresentativeof where young Republicans and the GOP nationally are.\n\nThe Texas GOP needs to get with the 21st century — or history and future elections alike won’t be kind to it.\n\nBrad Polumbo (@Brad_Polumbo) is a co-founder ofBased-Politics.com, a co-host of theBasedPoliticspodcast, and aWashington Examinercontributor.\n\nNotifications"}

Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the only military honor provided to Lathon’s family was folding and presenting them with an American flag.\n\n“I gave his daughter the flag,” said his wife, Sheraine Lathon, 69, of Richton Park. “Then I offered him up to the Lord. That was it. It was about 10 minutes.”\n\nMany military families have had to forgo receiving the ceremonial honors typical for a veteran funeral — no 21-gun salutes or bugle playing “taps.” But families seldom waited to bury their loved ones, even when they weren’t even able to go to the cemetery and see them laid to rest.\n\nSome families opted to delay holding a visitation with extended family and friends until capacity restrictions loosened. With Memorial Day weekend bringing to the forefront memories of veterans who have died in service and those who have died during the pandemic, some families are questioning whether to have a service now and relive the grief, funeral directors said.\n\n“They’ve done some healing through grief for the last number of months,” said Stephen Dawson, president and owner of Sax-Tiedemann Funeral Home and Crematorium in Franklin Park. “Trying to reopen that and relive that and have a formal, public way to express grief … people don’t want to reopen old wounds.”\n\nFor some, holding a funeral service at a later date is like “trying to start that (grief cycle) all over again,” Dawson said.\n\nEspecially early in the pandemic, many veterans were sent to Lincoln National Cemetery for direct interment, or burial immediately after their death, without a service or memorial, said Antonio Henderson, the cemetery’s assistant director. The cemetery gave those families an option to have memorial services in recent months as pandemic guidelines loosened, which has been “very popular” among military families, Henderson said.\n\nThe national cemetery has since expanded capacity limits to match changing guidelines and now provides veterans with a more traditional burial, Henderson said. On May 10, the cemetery welcomed back its full Memorial Squad team, which provides military honors, and everything is “just about” back to normal, Henderson said.\n\n“It’s the last reminder of the service that they gave to the country,” Henderson said. “It also brings closure to the family. It’s not just the husband or wife that’s in the military. It’s also the family as well.”\n\nAt the Archdiocese of Chicago Catholic Cemeteries, the number of burials held steady over the past year, with no notable surges or drops, said Susan Thomas, spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Chicago.\n\nSheraine Lathon is pastor at Liberty Temple Full Gospel Church in the Beverly View neighborhood on the South Side. During the pandemic, the church held services for about 18 congregants who have died, including her husband, she said, though some of the services had to be livestreamed on the church’s Facebook page.\n\nIn the early months of the pandemic, burial services at Lincoln National Cemetery — including Willie Lathon’s — were as small as 10 people or fewer, Henderson said.\n\n“Not just my family, but many families suffered through only being able to do so much,” Sheraine Lathon said, “not being able to be collectively with your family.”\n\nGolden Gate Funeral Home, part of the national Veterans Funeral Care network, handled arrangements for Willie Lathon and many other veterans who died during the pandemic.\n\nWatching families stay in their cars for services and not have proper military honors was “one of the anguishes that we experienced,” said Sylvester Dunn, the Gresham funeral home’s general manager.\n\nMilitary veterans “faced some horrendous things during their tour of duty,” Dunn said, and allowing families to celebrate their loved ones “in the right way” helps provide them closure.\n\nBut instead of delaying burials during a pandemic with no clear end in sight, Dunn said families went forward with laying to rest their loved ones, despite the disappointment, sadness and loneliness without extended family and friends there. The funeral home offered those families the chance to hold a memorial service at a later time for free, Dunn said.\n\nWillie Lathon had been receiving dialysis treatments for two years and spent much of that time in a hospital. Sheraine Lathon said she is grateful her husband died in their home of natural causes instead of alone in a hospital room like many COVID-19 patients. He was 72.\n\nThursday will mark one year since her husband died, and June 11 would have been the Lathons’ 39th wedding anniversary, Sheraine Lathon said, on top of Memorial Day weekend honoring veterans across the country.\n\nBut despite the anniversaries and holidays stirring ..."}

Its allies have plenty. But gettingfighter jets to Ukraineismuch more complicatedthan it might seem.\n\nOn Wednesday, theBiden administration rejected a proposal from Polandthat would have made its old Russian-made MiG fighters available to a U.S. base in Germany for potential handover to Ukraine, because it would be a “high risk” step that could ratchet up tensions withRussia, the Defense Department said.\n\nThe difficulties are legal, logistical and political. Top leaders of NATO — the alliance of 30 countries that includes the U.S. and Germany — want to help Ukraine but have resisted actions that could drag it directly into Moscow’s war against its neighbor.\n\nOfficials so far have deemed Ukraine's appeals for additional fighter jets, as well as requests to impose ano-fly zone, as moves that would risk direct conflict with Russia.\n\nU.S. or Western European planes are out of the question, because Ukrainian pilots don’t know how to fly them.\n\n“Their military is basically built off the Soviet-Russian military, so they operate Soviet-Russian equipment,” said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress who oversaw international security assistance in his former role as a State Department official. “It’s a bit like if you give someone an iPhone who has always had an Android. And you don’t want to be reading a flight manual while you’re at war.”\n\nThat’s why countries in the former East bloc that are now part of NATO, like Poland and Latvia, have offered to send their MiG jets to Ukraine in exchange for a promise from Washington to replace them with newer U.S.-made planes in the future.\n\nThe Pentagon has said that in practice, the trade proposal isn’t “tenable.” Washington has also promised its next batch of sales of F-16 fighters to Taiwan to counter China.\n\nCountries sell or give away new and used military defense equipment to foreign countries all the time — the State Department oversees$55 billion a year in sales— and it’s typically the responsibility of the buyer to go pick it up.\n\nBut Western officials worry that if Ukrainian pilots go to a NATO country to pick up fighter jets and then fly them back into contested Ukrainian airspace, where they might have to engage with Russian fighters, Moscow will view the country they left from as a combatant and therefore fair game.\n\nAnd NATO’s core tenet, spelled out inArticle 5of its charter, is that an attack on any member country is an attack on all, meaning all 30 member states would be obligated to join the fight.\n\n“The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian reaction that could increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday.\n\nSome have discussed shipping the fighter jets overland or even dismantling them and reassembling them inside Ukraine. But Kirby said U.S. military and intelligence officials determined that more jets are \"not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities.\"\n\nExperts outside the government have noted that Ukraine hasn’t deployed many of the MiGs it already owns, which makes them wonder whether the country has the complex infrastructure needed to support the aircraft, from trained pilots and mechanics to extra parts, munitions and jet fuel.\n\nThe losses suffered by Ukraine’s air force in the Russian invasion have been compounded by “years of neglect and underfunding,” according to the Congressional Research Service. “Most of Ukraine’s planes and air defense systems are over 30 years old.”\n\nThe country’s major air power success seems to have come largely fromTurkish-made drones, not manned fighter jets.\n\nRussia’s air force has suffered from itsown apparent logistical limits; however, it still has more modern aircraft thanMiG-29s, which first took to the air in the late 1970s.\n\n“The broader thing is that this is probably all just a waste of time,” Bergmann said. “Would we just be putting Ukrainians up in 30-, 40-year-old fighter jets that are just basically flying coffins?”\n\nAlex Seitz-Wald was a former national politics reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"}

He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race.\n\n\"This would be a very dangerous step that, I'm sure, not only will not be comprehended by the international community but will provoke serious condemnation,\" Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said.\n\nThe treaty is \"significant for international security and security in the sphere of nuclear arms, for the maintenance of strategic stability,\" he told state news agency Tass.\n\nThe minister also told the news agency RIA Novosti that if the US continued to behave \"clumsily and crudely\" and backed out of international agreements, \"then we will have no choice but to undertake retaliatory measures, including involving military technology\".\n\n\"But we would not want to get to this stage,\" he added.\n\nAnalysis by BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus\n\nConcern about Russia's development and deployment of a missile system that breaches the INF treaty predates the Trump administration. But the president's decision to walk away from the agreement marks a significant setback for arms control.\n\nMany experts believe that negotiations should have continued to try to bring the Russians back into compliance. It is, they fear, part of the wider unravelling of the whole system of arms control treaties that helped to curb strategic competition during the Cold War.\n\nOther factors too may have played into President Trump's decision. This was a bilateral treaty between Washington and Moscow. China was free to develop and deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles. Some in the Trump administration feel that the INF treaty places them at a growing disadvantage in their developing  strategic rivalry with Beijing .\n\nThe US insists the Russians have, in breach of the deal, developed a new medium-range missile called the Novator 9M729 - known to Nato as the SSC-8.\n\nIt would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice.\n\nRussia has said little about its new missile other than to deny that it is in breach of the agreement. Analysts say Russia sees such weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Fridaythe US was considering withdrawing from the treaty in a bid to counter China's expanding military presencein the western Pacific. China was not a signatory of the deal, allowing it to develop medium-range missiles without restraint.\n\nThe last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles.\n\nHis administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

However, that timeline might get just a bit smaller soon enough.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is set to announce Tuesday that its scientists at the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California  have achieved a”breakthrough” in fusion energy—marking a massive milestone on the road to creating clean, sustainable power. Though the significance of this depends on who you speak with.\n\nFirst, a quick and dirty physics lesson: Fusion energy is a method of producing electricity by smashing (or fusing) atoms together, releasing enormous gobs of energy in the process. This reaction occurs constantly on stars like the sun, which fuses 500 tons of hydrogen atoms every second. If we could replicate this reaction on Earth, we could have a source of virtually unlimited clean energy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe target chamber at the National Ignition Facility where nearly 200 laser beams are focused on on a gold capsule containing deuterium and tritium.\n\nBut that’s easier said than done. For decades, fusion scientists have attempted to create reactions by essentially shooting high-powered laser beams at hydrogen atoms. However, they’ve struggled to reach a phenomenon called “ignition,” which is a break-even point when a fusion reactor produces more energy than it consumes.\n\nResearchers have gotten close in the past—the NIF was able toproduce 70 percent of the energy needed to begin a fusion reaction in 2021. The lab might now be a massive step closer after new experiments reportedly resulted in a net energy gain, which means it extracted more energy from the fusion reaction than was required to trigger it, according toThe Financial Times.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut wait, isn’t that the same thing as ignition? Not quite. Ignition requires the nuclear reaction to be self-sustaining, which means that it creates a chain of reactions that create other reactions and so on. When that happens, things start toreallycook (just make sure the robot octopus arms you’re using for the experiment don’t get damaged in the process).\n\n“You don’t have to keep on throwing matches into a fire to keep it burning,” Arturo Dominguez, a plasma physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory who wasn’t involved in the experiment, told The Daily Beast. “The heat from the fire itself is going to keep it going as long as you have enough fuel. That’s ignition.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFTreported that the latest experiment used 2.1 megajoules of energy to produce 2.5 megajoules—or 120 percent more than what was needed to create it. However, the data is currently being verified. “Our analysis is still ongoing, so we’re unable to provide details or confirmation this time,” a spokesperson for LLNL told The Daily Beast.\n\nIf the alleged breakthrough turns out to be true, then it would mark the first time researchers have been able to create more energy than they put in fusion reactions. “We’ve never gotten that energy gain. We’ve never gotten more energy out than the energy you put in,” Dominguez explained. “So this would be revolutionary.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut we’re still a long, long way from being able to incorporate fusion into our energy infrastructure. For one, the NIF’s experiment utilized a program called inertial confinement fusion, which involves zapping a small amount of hydrogen plasma with nearly 200 of the world’s biggest lasers. This creates a series of quick explosions, heating up the reactor to 150 million degrees Celsius, or roughly 10 times hotter than the center of the sun.\n\nWhile very sci-fi, the energy production occurs in the span of nanoseconds—not quite the self-sustaining reaction we’d get from ignition. The energy it created wastinytoo. In fact,one scientist toldCNNthat the recent NIF reaction created just enough energy to “boil 10 kettles of water.” That’s not enough to power a house, let alone entire nations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, despite the immense hype surrounding the fusion announcement, this doesn’t mean we’re anywhere close to actually achieving the “holy grail” of clean energy—and, in fact, are still very far away from making fusion a reality.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that this isn’t a cause for celebration—especially for all of the scientists and researchers who have been working at net energy gain for so long. Their efforts have only become more popular as nations begin to recognize the game changing potential of fusion energy. As a result,  countries such as theU.S.andChinahave been pouring billions into researching the technology in recent years.\n\nNow, they finally have something to show for it.\n\n“This [experiment] doesn’t mean that electricity from fusion is around the corner,” Dominguez said. “But what this does mean is that there is a physics basis for the work that’s being done in fusion. And we’ve proven now in an experiment that you can get more energy out than energy that goes in.”\n\nGot a ..."}

There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY.’ We want our Capital BACK,” Trump wrote in a post Sunday on Truth Social ahead of a planned White House press conference Monday morning about the city’s cleanliness and general condition.\n\nThe possible order follows Trump’s “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful” executive order signed on March 28, which established a task force dedicated to fighting crime and reducing illegal immigration in the city.\n\n“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don’t have to move out. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong,” Trump wrote in the social media post — comparing the action to his illegal immigration crackdown at the border.\n\n“The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive,” Trump said in a different post Sunday.\n\nBowser has since fought back on Trump’s characterization of the city.\n\n“If the priority is to show force in an American city, we know he can do that here,” Bowsersaid on MSNBC Sunday morning.“But it won’t be because there’s a spike in crime.”\n\nViolent crime is down 26% compared with this time in 2024, according to DC police data, and there have been roughly 20% fewer juvenile arrests this year, the Washington Post reported.\n\nHowever, the White House isn’t backing down — noting that the city’s “been plagued by petty and violent crime for far too long,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nUS Park Policearrested more than half a dozen perpsin the capital on charges including possession of stolen firearms and illicit drugs as part of a federal crackdown launched by the Trump administration Thursday to clean up the nation’s capital.\n\nEight culprits were arrested in the surge and two handguns were confiscated from offenders with prior felony convictions, Park Police Fraternal Order of Police chairman Kenneth Spencer told The Post Friday.\n\nAt least 30 “fraudulent oxycodone pills” — which appeared to be fentanyl — were also seized, along with 210 grams of crack cocaine, 600 grams of marijuana, 64 grams of hashish oil and cash with a total value of $3,600, Spencer added.\n\nThe show of force was in part sparked by thebeating of a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) stafferwho was bloodied by a mob of 10 minors last Sunday as he thwarted a carjacking attempt in the nation’s capital, according to DC police.\n\nEdward Coristine, whose LinkedIn handle earned him the nickname “Big Balls” at DOGE, was with a woman near downtown DC when he saw the group of juveniles approach their car and “make a comment about taking the vehicle.”\n\nTrump and Coristine’s former boss Elon Musk shared a photograph of the aftermath of the assault on Coristine early Tuesday afternoon, showing the former DOGE staffer sitting on the ground, bloodied and with his ripped shirt barely hanging on his body.\n\nCritics and residents have fired back at Trump’s sweeping crackdown and removal of the homeless as inhumane.\n\n“That money could be better spent getting folks housing and support,” Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center, told the Washington Post.\n\nIt is not yet clear what exactly federal troops would do, but they could be deployed to protect federal agents or even carry out administrative tasks to free up law enforcement, officials said.\n\nWith Post wires\n\nAdvertisement"}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Trump Criticizes Democrats Medicare All Proposal", "output": "President Donald Trump knocked Democrats in incendiary terms ahead of the midterm elections with an op-ed decrying a proposal to establish a single-payer health care system.\n\nIn the rarepresidential op-edpublished in USA Today, Trump claimed the proposal dubbed “Medicare for all” would “eviscerate” Medicare, the popular government program providing health care to seniors and some with disabilities.\n\n“Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care,” the op-ed reads.\n\nChampioned for years by the left flank of the party, Medicare for allgained supportfollowing Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ bid for the presidency. Many potential candidates for the party’s 2020 nominationjoined Sanderslast year in filing a bill to establish the program, and former President Barack Obama referred to Medicare for all approvingly in a speech last month.\n\nTrump, in his op-ed less than a month from the November elections, claimed the plan would devastate the health care industry, undercut Medicare in its current form and “inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.”\n\n“In practice, the Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None,” Trump said. “Under the Democrats’ plan, today’s Medicare would be forced to die.”\n\nMedicare for all would gradually phase-in all Americans to a government-run system that replaces private insurance. Trump and others have pointed to the hefty price tag projected for the plan, while Sanders and the proposal’s supporters have noted businesses and people would no longer have to pay premiums to private insurance companies.\n\nIn the op-ed, Trump cites aworking paperfrom the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which receives funding from the conservative Koch brothers. The paper says that a national single-payer system would cost $32.6 trillion over its first 10 years. The estimate is in line with onepublishedby the left-leaning Urban Institute in 2016, that said it would increase federal expenditures by $32 trillion.\n\nSanders and other Democrats say the same Mercatus report claims the proposal wouldsave Americans $2 trillionon all health care costs over the same time period.\n\nBut the author of the study has saidthat claim is not his conclusionbut based on assumptions made by Sanders. In fact, he wrote that “it is likely the actual cost of (Medicare for all) would be substantially greater than these estimates.”\n\nMedicare and other entitlements are regular battle zones between the parties, with each accusing one another of working to destroy the popular programs.\n\nTrump, for his part, campaigned on a pledge to protect Medicare, which is set to run out of funds in under a decade, and has worked to repeal Obamacare, which nonpartisan analysts said would lead to massive increases in the uninsured.\n\nIn the op-ed, Trump said he’s kept his promise to lower health care premiums. While they have come down, his actions are not the reason insurers are lowering premiums.\n\nMany insurers are breaking even or have started making a profit in the individual market, and the threat of Congress repealing the law has waned.\n\nAfter several years of large premium increases, insurers are finally charging enough to cover the health care costs of their enrollees. More are seeing it as a viable business.\n\nSeveral states have also taken steps to help insulate insurers from high-cost enrollees, which is also prompting insures to reduce their rate hikes or even lower premiums for 2019.\n\nIn a statement responding to the op-ed, Sanders contrasted his proposal with Trump’s own record on health care and accused him of lying about Medicare for all.\n\n“The time is now for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to every American as a right not a privilege, and Donald Trump, the insurance companies and the drug companies will not stop us,” Sanders said.\n\nThe op-ed painted the Democratic Party as “extreme” for the support the proposal has received from some members of the House and Senate as well as a handful of Democratic gubernatorial nominees. Trump went on to claim that a Democratic victory this fall would lead to failed socialist policies in other sectors besides health care and pointed to thecalls from someto abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to say the party “is for open-borders socialism.”\n\n“If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America,” Trump said. “Government-run health care is just the beginning. Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the US economy.”\n\nSanders and other Democrats who support Medicare for all say that health care is a human right and should be available to all Americans. The best way to provide this, they say, is broadening Medicare, which is successful, cost-effective and popular.\n\n“If every major country o..."}

We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what’s happening and why it matters.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism.Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe former Trump campaign chair may now get a tougher sentence.\n\nEvidence suggests that Paul Manafort deliberately lied to special counsel Robert Mueller’s team after he had agreed to cooperate, a federal judgeruled Wednesday.\n\nAfter dueling filings and arguments from prosecutors and the defense over the past few months, Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Mueller’s team on three of the five areas in which they’d accused Manafort of lying.\n\nManafort, Donald Trump’s former campaign chair, has already been convicted of financial crimes in Virginia and has pleaded guilty to other charges in Washington. He was not charged with new crimes related to these alleged false statements.\n\nBut now, Jackson will take these purported lies during cooperation into account when she sentences Manafort for the DC crimes on March 13 — and they may well spur her to give him a tougher sentence.\n\nThe wrangling between Mueller’s and Manafort’s teams about the alleged lies provided a fascinating glimpse into the investigation, revealing both deeper Russian ties and more shady financial behavior from Manafort.We learnedthat Mueller is claiming:\n\nMueller did not, however, use this dispute to give any sort of larger assessment on the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia or the president himself.\n\nTo recap: Manafort was indicted by Mueller in two venues, Virginia and Washington, DC. He was charged with tax violations, bank fraud, lobbying, and false statements — but he was not charged with any crimes related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Last August, Manafort was convicted at his first trial, in Virginia. Then he struck a plea deal in DC to avert the second trial — and committed to cooperating with the government.\n\nManafort’s apparent “flip”appeared to be a major turning point in the Mueller investigation. It seemed as if Mueller now had a cooperator who had close ties to both Trump and Russia (the latter because Manafort worked for Ukraine’s pro-Russian political faction for many years).\n\nSo from September to November of last year, Manafort was questioned by Mueller’s team a total of 12 times, and also appeared to testify before Mueller’s grand jury twice. He was reportedly asked about a plethora of topics.\n\nBut eventually, Mueller’s team concluded that Manafort was repeatedly lying to them — and on November 26, theyaccused him of breachinghis cooperation agreement.\n\nBecause of the way the plea deal was structured, Manafort’s guilty plea and the related forfeiture of much of his wealth remained in place.\n\nBut Manafort’s team did dispute that he had deliberately lied, arguing that there was a combination of memory failures and mix-ups from Manafort and misunderstandings from the special counsel’s team.\n\nNow, the government only had to meet a very low bar to find Manafort in breach of the agreement — basically, they just had to come to the good-faith conclusion that he lied.\n\nHowever, the judge overseeing Manafort’s case in DC, Amy Berman Jackson, had her own reasons for wanting more details. She said she wanted to assess the government’s evidence about these alleged lies, because she wanted to weigh this as a factor in Manafort’s sentencing. (Meaning she might want to give Manafort a harsher sentence if she was convinced he lied.)\n\nSo in a series of partially redacted filings and then at a sealed hearing on February 3, prosecutors and the defense squared off, with Mueller’s team arguing that there was a pattern of deliberate lies from Manafort, and the defense claiming it was all a series of misunderstandings and unintentional misstatements.\n\nAn important technical note is that Jackson did not have to find that it was “beyond a reasonable doubt” that Manafort lied, the traditional standard for criminal conviction by a jury. She only had to rule on whether “a preponderance of the evidence” suggested Manafort lied — a lighter standard. The alternative was to rule that Mueller had “failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence” that Manafort lied.\n\nTo make the case that Manafort lied during cooperation, Mueller’s team singled out five topics in particular.\n\nNone of the topics, so far as we know, directly involve President Donald Trump. In particular, the infamousTrump Tower meetingwith a Russian lawyer that Manafort attended is absent from the list. Roger Stone, Manafort’s longtime friend, is also not mentioned. We should not necessarily read too much into these omissions, though — Mueller’s team made clear that the five were not necessarily the only topics Manafort lied about. They are:\n\n1) The $125,000 payment:In 2016, Manafort had helped set up a pro-Trump Super PAC and installed a longtime friend to run it. That Super PAC paid mil..."}

Joe Manchin dealt a blow to fellow Democrats and President Joe Biden Thursday, announcing he won’t back a massive social welfare spending package that costs more than $1.5 trillion.\n\nThe figure, which Manchin has been floating publicly for weeks, falls far below the $3.5 trillion most House and Senate Democrats say they need at minimum to create a broad array of new government programs and assistance under Biden’s Build Back Better Plan. Manchin’s announcement is likely to thwart efforts to pass a critical bipartisan infrastructure plan on Thursday that Biden hoped to sign into law along with it.\n\nManchin, speaking to reporters outside the Senate, said he has other problems with the big spending bill Democrats propose. He will not agree to the plan to pay for the bill by raising corporate taxes to 26.5%. Manchin said 25% is his limit, citing the potential damage to the economy and businesses.\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat on Wednesday called the Democratic plan to spend $3.5 trillion “fiscal insanity” paid for with “vindictive” taxes.\n\nWhile he represents only one vote, his support is critical. Senate Democrats hope to pass the bill using a budgetary tactic requiring only 51 votes. The Senate is evenly split, which means one defection would kill the legislation. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, also seeks to lower the cost of the $3.5 trillion measure.\n\nManchin is in no hurry to pass a major spending bill.\n\nManchin said the smaller bill he proposes should focus on children and the elderly and reforming the tax code, but not the broad array of spending programs liberal Democrats plan, nor the tough green energy policies aimed at ending the use of fossil fuels.\n\nManchin also said new spending programs must be means-tested to ensure only the neediest benefit.\n\nManchin’s announcement strikes a blow to the plan by Democrats to pass legislation that would pay for free universal preschool, free community college, expanded Medicare and Medicaid benefits, paid family and medical leave, and an array of new green energy policies, among many other things.\n\nMuch of that will have to wait, Manchin suggested.\n\n“Let’s do what we can, and then the other things they want to do, maybe can be done at a later time,” Manchin said.\n\nManchin’s top-line number and conditions for the bill were part of a signed agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer dated July 28.\n\nManchin acknowledged the document stating his $1.5 trillion limit, which apparently was used to win his vote on a framework agreement for the spending bill.\n\nHe explained how he came up with the number.\n\n“Because I believe in my heart that is what we can do, with the needs we have right now, and what we can afford to do, without basically changing our whole society to an entitlement mentality.”\n\nManchin has been in talks with Biden for days in an effort to reach an accord that can please all Democrats.\n\nManchin’s announcement, however, is likely to further alienate liberal Democrats, who are threatening to block a critical infrastructure bill Manchin supports and which the Senate passed with bipartisan support earlier this year.\n\nThe bill is up for a vote later Thursday in the House but appears to lack enough support to pass.\n\nManchin said it would “be a shame” if Democrats block it.\n\nThe measure would pay for roads, bridges, water projects, and broadband expansion as well as new electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nManchin said he disagrees with Democrats who said the two measures need to pass at the same time.\n\n“No two bills should ever be linked together to the point to where you’re going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Manchin said.\n\nManchin, fielding questions from reporters about anger from fellow Democrats who want to spend much more money while they control Congress and the White House, said those lawmakers must win more seats in the House and Senate in the next election.\n\n“Basically, take whatever we aren’t able to come to an agreement with today, and take that on the campaign trail next year and I’m sure that you’ll get many more liberal progressive Democrats with what they say they want,” Manchin said.\n\nNotifications"}

It was disappointing that Martha’s Vineyard called in the Massachusetts National Guard to bus them away from the island within 48 hours.\n\nImmediately after the migrants arrived on Martha’s Vineyard, Democrats began pushing the absurd talking point that DeSantis “kidnapped” the migrants in order to use them as political pawns. Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom even called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate potential wrongdoing.\n\nNewsomwroteon Thursday:\n\nLike millions of Americans, I have been horrified at the images of migrants being shipped on buses and planes across the country to be used as political props.

It targets what the politicians say are concepts found in critical race theory, a decades-old idea that considers the ways race and racism influence American politics, culture, and law.\n\n“One of the things this legislation and others around the country is causing is keeping the silence [about racism] ... and that’s harmful for all of us but most particularly students of color,” she says.\n\nA tug of war over the teaching of American history and race is playing out in state legislatures. Given the chasm between views on either side, what is the best path forward?\n\nMs. Steenman, who lives in Franklin, Tennessee, and runs a local chapter of the national group Moms for Liberty, has a different view. She sees critical race theory as an effort to sow strife among Americans and overturn racial progress.\n\n“It seeks to divide along racial lines,” she says. “When you start bringing up critical race theory and bringing up skin color, you ... go back to neo-racism and neo-segregation and it’s a tragedy.”\n\nA culture war is heating up just as students and teachers are starting to break for summer. Stoking the divisiveness is a push by conservative politicians to focus on critical race theory and whether its tenets are adversely affecting school climate and should be prohibited. Arguments for and against the approach do not always track precisely along political, racial, or ideological lines. In general, those in favor of the new laws want more restrictions as classroom discussions and hastily implemented anti-racist lesson plans have taken hold in the past year. Those opposed say statehouse rules could have a chilling effect on conversation about racism and race in schools just when it is needed most.\n\nA key step toward finding middle ground will be if opponents can agree to “let kids in on the secret that we disagree,” and allow teachers to present both sides of the debate in class, says Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of the history of education at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“The debate isn’t about whether there’s been racism; it’s about what racism has meant and what it’s done to America. Is it something that’s been progressively overcome as we move toward fulfilling our national ideals, or is it something that’s been a constant force in society, making society itself irredeemably racist?” says Professor Zimmerman, author of “Whose America?: Culture Wars in the Public Schools.” “What we need is for each side to have the courage to let that debate happen in our classrooms.”\n\nNationally, the discussion of race shows no sign of abating. This week the United States is remembering the 100th anniversary of theTulsa race massacre– one of the worst incidents of race-related violence in the country’s history. It’s an event that Americans by and large learned little about in school, as actor Tom Hanks wrote in an opinionpieceFriday. Former Vice President Mike Pence also weighed in on the subject ina speechon Thursday calling systemic racism a “left-wing myth.”\n\nTo date, conservative politicians in 16 states have introduced legislation aimed at prohibiting concepts they cite as divisive and often attribute to critical race theory. So far, bills have passed into law in Arkansas, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. A Texas bill is awaiting the governor’s signature.

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to its lowest level since the pandemic began, a sign the job market is still improving even as hiring has slowed in the past two months. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to its lowest level since the pandemic began, a sign the job market is still improving even as hiring has slowed in the past two months.\n\nUnemployment claims dropped 36,000 to 293,000 last week, the second straight drop, the Labor Department said Thursday. That’s the smallest number of people to apply for benefits since the week of March 14, 2020, when the pandemic intensified, and the first time claims have dipped below 300,000. Applications for jobless aid, which generally track the pace of layoffs, have fallen steadily since last spring as many businesses, struggling to fill jobs, have held onto their workers.\n\nThe decline in layoffs comes amid an otherwise unusual job market. Hiringhas slowed in the past two months, even as companies and other employers haveposted a near-record number of open jobs. Businesses are struggling to find workers as about three million people who lost jobs and stopped looking for work since the pandemic have yet to resume their job searches. Economistshoped more people would find work in Septemberas schools reopened, easing child care constraints, and enhanced unemployment aid ended nationwide.\n\nBut the pickup didn’t happen, withemployers adding just 194,000 jobslast month. In a bright spot, the unemployment rate fell to 4.8% from 5.2%, though some of that decline occurred because many of those out of work stopped searching for jobs, and were no longer counted as unemployed. The proportion of women working or looking for work fell in September, likely because of difficulties finding child care or because of schools disrupted by COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nAt the same time, Americans arequitting their jobs in record numbers,with about 3% of workers doing so in August. Workers have been particularly likely to leave their jobs at restaurants, bars, and hotels, possibly spurred by fear of the delta variant of COVID-19, which was still spreading rapidly in August.\n\nOther workers likely quit to take advantage of higher wages offered by businesses with open positions. Average hourly pay rose at a healthy 4.6% in September from a year earlier, and for restaurant workers wage gains in the past year have topped 10%.\n\nThe number of people continuing to receive unemployment aid has also fallen sharply, mostly as two emergency jobless aid programs have ended. In the week ending Sept. 25, the latest data available, 3.6 million people received some sort of jobless aid, down sharply from 4.2 million in the previous week. A year ago, nearly 25 million people were receiving benefits.\n\nThe emergency programs provided unemployment payments for the first time to the self-employed and gig workers, and those who were out of work for more than six months. More than 7 million Americans lost weekly financial support when those two programs expired Sept. 6. An extra $300 in federal jobless aid also expired that week.\n\nMany business executives and Republican politicians said the extra $300 was discouraging those out of work from taking jobs. Yet in about half the states, the additional checks were cutoff as early as mid-June, and those states have not seen faster job growth than states that kept the benefits.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Mark Green, R-Tenn., on Democrats skipping House hearings at the southern border, and the seriousness of Russia striking a U.S. drone.\n\nRepublicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are looking to turn up the heat onDHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkasin the wake of bombshell testimony from Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz that the chairman of the committee described as \"earth-shattering.\"\n\nOrtiz had been the main witness at the committee’s field hearing in McAllen, Texas, on Wednesday and had bucked the administration on a number of issues. Ortiz told lawmakers that he disagreed with President Biden’s call to stop wall construction, said there were policies in place that were holding agents back from doing their job, and backed agents who had falsely been accused of whipping Haitian migrants.\n\nBut the takeaway from lawmakers was Ortiz’s statement that the U.S. does not haveoperational controlof the border – a statement that contradicted what Mayorkas told lawmakers last year – and that multiple sectors were overwhelmed by the historic migrant flows being encountered.\n\n\"In five of those nine southwest border sectors, we have seen an increase in flow and that has caused a considerable strain on our resources and really has forced the Border Patrol to move so agents and even migrants to some of the other areas,\" he said in response to a question about whether the border is secure.\n\nBORDER PATROL CHIEF SAYS DHS DOESN'T HAVE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF US BORDER\n\nMarch 15, 2023: Rep. Mark Green questions Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz.(Screenshot)\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital on Thursday, Chairman Mark Green described those takeaways as \"huge statements.\"\n\n\"I knew that he was the kind of guy who would shoot straight and be honest. And we prepared, so we did our homework, and we were prepared. I think you put the two together, and you got what we got, which is some pretty earth-shattering stuff,\" he said.\n\nWith the border crisis still ongoing and with the end to Title 42 expulsions less than two months away, Green told Fox that his committee is eyeing additional testimony after Wednesday's hearing. Mayorkas is likely to be one of those the committee wants to provide testimony. Green said the committee will have \"tons of questions\" for the DHS chief.\n\n\"I think we want to talk to all the sector chiefs, but certainly the five that are struggling with the overflow right now and get their perspectives,\" he said. \"And then at some point, Secretary Mayorkas is going to have to come and answer the question – did he lie to Congress, or is he just ignorant about the definition in the code on what defines operational security?\"\n\nRep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, who also questioned Ortiz at the hearing, praised the Chief for how he handled what Republicans acknowledged was a difficult situation for the official.\n\n\"Chief Ortiz is to be commended for walking a fine line, as one of my other colleagues said, of being respectful of the political hierarchy, but also telling the truth and saying enough is enough,\" he said.\n\n\"It was about time,\" he said. \"I'm grateful that somebody had the courage to tell the truth about that.\"\n\nPfluger similarly believed that one of the next steps was to hear from Mayorkas.\n\nWHITE HOUSE ACCUSES HOUSE REPUBLICANS OF PLAYING ‘PARTISAN GAMES’ WITH TEXAS BORDER FIELD HEARING'\n\nMarch 15, 2023: Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz testifies at a Homeland Security hearing.(Screenshot)\n\n\"I think that we should move quickly, with a sense of urgency to have Secretary Mayorkas testify in front of Congress,\" he said. \"We have heard from the lead officer in charge of the security of our border that it's not secure. And now the same question needs to be posed to Secretary Mayorkas. Will he disagree with the lead officer in charge of border security?\"\n\nThe Biden administration has been pushing back against the narrative from Republicans that seeks to blame the administration’s policies for the crisis. DHS said in a statement Wednesday that the hearing \"highlights the vital work the Department of Homeland Security does every day to enforce our laws, secure our border, and combat cartels and smugglers\" and pointed to testimony from Ortiz and other witnesses that showed \"new programs, technology, and investments are making a real impact.\"\n\nThe administration has pointed to recent drops in numbers through January and February as signs that recent border measures – including expanded Title 42 expulsions and a humanitarian parole program that allows 30,000 migrants from four countries to fly in each month – are working.\n\nMIGRANT ENCOUNTERS IN FEBRUARY DOWN TO LOWEST LEVEL SIN..."}

The jury found that Lieber had lied about his affiliation with the Wuhan University of Technology in China and a contract he had with a Chinese talent recruitment plan to attract high-level scientists to the country.\n\nHe was being paid $50,000 per month by the Chinese university and given $1.5 million to establish a nanoscience research lab at WUT, the Justice Department said in a news release. Lieberman was specifically affiliated with China’s Thousand Talents Program, which the department called “one of the most prominent talent recruitment plans designed to attract, recruit and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China’s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.”\n\nActing US attorney Nathaniel Mendell said in a statement Tuesday that “there is now no question that Charles Lieber lied to federal investigators and to Harvard in an attempt to hide his participation in the Chinese Thousand Talents Program.”\n\n“He lied to the IRS about the money he was paid, and he concealed his Chinese bank account from the United States. The jury followed the evidence and the law to a just verdict,” he continued.\n\nPatrick Hegarty, the special agent in charge of the Northeast field office Defense Criminal Investigative Service, similarly said in a statement that Lieber “eroded the trust the DoD has in its researchers to prioritize the United States and its service members over foreign governments, and over personal financial gain.”\n\nLieber’s sentencing date has not yet been scheduled.\n\nCNN’s Evan Perez, Rob Frehse, Veronica Stracqualursi and Sheena Jones contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

But he rejected them and continue to mislead the public to lay the groundwork to reverse the Electoral College result.\n\nMr. Eastman was told to develop a legal strategy to persuade Mr. Pence to refuse to certify the Electoral College results when he presided on Jan. 6, 2021, over Congress’ meeting to do that — usually a pro forma gathering that became a riot.\n\n“Dr. Eastman’s emails may show that he helpedDonald Trumpadvance a corrupt scheme to obstruct the counting of electoral college ballots and a conspiracy to impede the transfer of power,” Reps. Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, respectively the select panel’s chair and vice chair, said in a separate statement.\n\nThe panel emphasized potential crimes to persuade U.S. District Court Judge David Carter that none of Mr. Eastman’s records are protected by privilege.\n\nAccording to emails presented by the Jan. 6 panel to the court, Mr. Eastman continued to press Mr. Pence even after the pro-Trumpmob stormed the Capitol and sent lawmakers fleeing.\n\n“Thanks to your bull——, we are now under siege,” Pence counsel Greg Jacob emailed Mr. Eastman, along with a lengthy rebuttal of his legal claims.\n\nAccording to emails obtained by the panel, Mr. Eastman replied that “the ‘siege’ is because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary to allow this to be aired in a public way so the American people can see for themselves what happened.”\n\nMr. Eastman later made another effort to convince Mr. Pence to stop the counting of Electoral College votes and called it a “relatively minor” violation of the federal law known as the Electoral Count Act.\n\n“Plaintiff knew what he was proposing would violate the law, but he nonetheless urged the Vice President to take those actions,” thecommitteewrote in its filings.\n\n• Victor Morton can be reached atvmorton@washingtontimes.com.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Washington Times, LLC.Click\n                            here for reprint permission.\n\nSEE MORE VIDEOS\n\nNow we know: Democrats just wanted to cause pain with shutdown\n\nBBC: The biased broadcasting corporation\n\nAnother government shutdown, another pointless waste of time"}

Politicoreportedon Wednesday that there is dysfunction in Harris' office and that much of the frustration stems from Flournoy. She oversaw about 10 employees in Clinton's office, while the vice president's office typically has a staff of up to 100 people.\n\nSeveral people who say they were close to Clinton before Flournoy became his chief of staff in 2013 spoke toCNBC after a story published earlier this weekdescribed her management of access to Harris.\n\nSeveral questioned her methods while she worked for Clinton. Some said Flournoy screamed at Clinton allies, while others said she limited staff access to the former president and ignored their ideas.\n\nOthers praised Flournoy, saying her approach was necessary given Harris' busy slate. She has many defenders in Washington, including the former president himself, allies of his and even a former chief of staff to Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\"Tina Flournoy ran my office for more than eight years, making it more efficient, effective, and transparent. She made it easier, not harder, for me to advance my philanthropic work and my post-presidential activities, and keep in touch with my friends,\" Clinton said in a statement first given to CNBC on Thursday. \"She has a unique ability to focus on the big picture and adapt to changing conditions. And she does it all with a great sense of humor and an unwavering belief that we all have an ability and an obligation to make a difference. She's an extraordinary person, and I'm so fortunate and forever grateful to have had her as my chief of staff.\"\n\nMatt McKenna, who was Clinton's spokesman during a part of Flournoy's tenure, lauded her for helping create a much-needed structure for Clinton's office.\n\n\"I think Tina put some much needed structure and guardrails around that operation and I'm grateful for it,\" McKenna told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nMinyon Moore, who worked in the Clinton White House and helped introduce Flournoy to Harris, defended her friend in atweet: \"Tina Flournoy is focused, disciplined, & the person I would want by my side.\" Moore did not return CNBC's request for comment for the previous story on Flournoy.\n\nSeveral allies of Biden and Harris took to Twitter to defend Flournoy after CNBC published its story.\n\n\"Chiefs of staff gotta run interference.

I've known these people for a really long time, and I don't work for you.' You can't call up and yell at me.\"\n\nOn multiple occasions, people who worked under Flournoy in Clinton's office felt they were boxed out as she favored only certain ideas.\n\nAfter Flournoy was hired in 2013, multiple senior advisors who continued to work under her leadership stopped gaining as much access as they did to Clinton prior to her arrival, said people briefed on the matter.\n\n\"Before people went into scheduling meetings, they had to meet with her before hand and run everything by her,\" a former longtime Clinton associate said. \"People would prepare a memo and she would have to see it first.

All Democrats who were present voted for the bill as well as Republican Senators Roy Blunt (MO), Richard Burr (NC), Shelley Moore Capito (WV), Susan Collins (ME), Joni Ernst (IA), Cynthia Lummis (WY), Lisa Murkowski (AK), Rob Portman (OH), Dan Sullivan (AK), Mitt Romney (UT), Thom Tillis (NC), and Todd Young (IN).\n\nThe bill now goes back to the House of Representatives for another vote because it was amended in the Senate. The House is expected to pass the bill and President Joe Biden is expected to sign it.\n\n“Today love won,” said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson in a statement. “This is a historic day, marking a much-needed victory for our community. The  LGBTQ+ community has faced ongoing deadly violence, legislative assaults and constant threats – including the deadly shooting in Colorado Springs barely one week ago. Today, with the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate — a historic moment that marks the first federal legislative win for LGBTQ+ equality in over ten years, since the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell — the 568,000 same-sex married couples in this country can breathe a sigh of relief that their marriages will be protected from future attacks.”\n\n“The fact that this bill passed with strong bipartisan support — earning the votes of  12 Republicans — again demonstrates that marriage equality enjoys growing bipartisan backing, is supported by a wide swath of the American people and is not going anywhere. We are closing this discriminatory chapter of our history — marriage equality is here to stay. And this is just the beginning — we have more work to do to fight with and for our transgender community…our BIPOC community, and our youngest community members with the same passion and energy that we brought to the fight for marriage equality.”\n\nThe RFMA would overturn the Defense of Marriage Act and require the federal government and state governments to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages performed in other states.\n\nProponents of the bill say that it’s necessary now that the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade, which shared part of its legal framework withObergefell v. Hodges, the decision that legalized marriage equality in all 50 states in 2015. Justice Clarence Thomas said that the Court should “reconsider”Obergefellin his concurring opinion inDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe this past summer.\n\nThat is, supporters of the bill believe the Court could be coming after marriage rights next.\n\nOpponents of the bill have said that it would end religious liberty by requiring churches to perform same-sex marriages, something that’s not in the RFMA.\n\nThe Senate also voted on three amendments offered by Republicans today, including an amendment from Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) that would greatly expand religious exemptions at the federal level. The Senate rejected all three.\n\nThe only Democrat who didn’t vote for the bill was Sen. Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), who is in Georgia campaigning for reelection in the state’s runoff election scheduled for December 6.\n\n“Love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love,” Biden said in a statement when the RFMA passed its first hurdle in the Senate earlier this month. “I want to thank the Members of Congress whose leadership has sent a strong message that Republicans and Democrats can work together to secure the fundamental right of Americans to marry the person they love.”\n\nIn a statement celebrating the Senate’s vote, Mayor Annise Parker, President & CEO of LGBTQ Victory Institute praised Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), who spearheaded the bill, as “a true political juggernaut” who “has solidified her place as one of the greatest LGBTQ leaders of all time.”\n\n“The personal conversations she had behind closed doors with reluctant colleagues certainly changed hearts and minds and led to today’s result,” Parker continued.\n\n“This landmark piece of legislation protects the marriages of millions of LGBTQ Americans who have not slept well for months, wondering if our marriages would be dissolved by an activist court. While the Respect for Marriage Act is undoubtedly one of the most important pro-LGBTQ laws ever passed, it does not require states to grant marriages to LGBTQ couples. Until then, our fight is not over.”\n\nSenate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tweeted that he celebrated the news by calling his daughter and her wife.\n\n“I just called my daughter and her wife—who are expecting a baby next spring—to let them know that this Senate passed the Respect for Marriage Act!

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartestopinion takesof the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\n“It takes no time to bend the knee,” Tyrion Lannister tells Jon Snow in the seventh season of “Game of Thrones,” urging him to “pledge your sword” to Queen Daenerys Targaryen.\n\n“And why would I do that?” Snow thunders back.\n\nSpeaking in Greenville, South Carolina, Tuesday, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley sounded a similar tone, insisting she plans to stay in the Republican primary battle even if former President Donald Trump continues to dominate the race. “I feel no need to kiss the ring,” Haleysaid. “And I have nofear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him. My own political future is of zero concern.”\n\nHaley’s increasingly sharp criticism of the former president stands out in a party whose leaders are, for the most part, eager to show the MAGA universe that they are true Trump believers, whatever they may say in private.\n\nYet yesterday’s results in her home state’s primary might affect Haley’s stance. (After all, Jon Snow changed his mind about bending the knee in “Game of Thrones,” on HBO, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery). Trump won the South Carolina primary by a wide margin and is poised to continue racking up delegates in the March contests in what looks like an unstoppable march to the nomination.\n\n“The immediate delegate math and the polls may not be on Haley’s side,” wroteGeoff Duncan, a Republican who served as Georgia’s lieutenant governor, “but believe it or not, many other numbers are. … During the fourth quarter of 2023, Haley out-raised Trump, $24 million to $19 million. The number was more than double the amount she raised in the third quarter. In January 2024, as the rest of the GOP field winnowed, Haley’s fundraising again bested Trump’s, $9.8 million to $8.8 million.”\n\n“There is only one viable exit ramp from the Trump-Biden sequel, and that is Haley. During the 2016 South Carolina primary, there were still six serious candidates in the GOP race. There is no reason for Haley to stop now.Even if the Trump fever doesn’t break in time for 2024, there’s always 2028, and time for GOP voters to wake up to what might have been, and still might be.”\n\nW. James Antle IIIargued that “if Haley keeps going, she is likely to lose by progressively bigger margins as the race simultaneously shifts to multiple states and media markets. She may also be blamed for delaying the party’s consolidation around and joint fundraising with Trump while Democrats are sparing President Joe Biden from an even semi-competitive primary.”\n\n“If she plans to help Trump win in November or have a personal comeback in the future, she should heed her home state’s voters and pull the plug.”\n\nLooking longer term,Kara Alaimoobserved, “The first woman to be elected president of the United States is very likely to be someone just like her. Women who try to lead bump up against many ridiculous and unfair stereotypes, but a big one is that we’re not strong. ‘Women simply do not fit the archetype of a leader in a country that stakes its superpower status on its military might,’ Secretary General of the Council of Women World Leaders Laura Liswood points out. ‘Men are presumed to be strong until they show otherwise. Women must prove they have strength.’”\n\n“One thing that would help Haley overcome this challenge is the fact that she is perceived as a foreign policy hawk. That could give her or another conservative woman an easier time winning votes than a woman who is more progressive. We’ve seen this play out in Europe, where most women leaders are conservative,” noted Alaimo.\n\nHaley’s name was not among the six people Trump confirmed are on his shortlist for the vice presidential nomination. They are: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nJulian Zelizerwrote that the list“should be taken with a massive grain of salt,”given Trump’s penchant for misdirection. “If the names are in fact representative, however, they could suggest that Trump is aiming to appeal to various constituencies such as Black and Latino voters that Democrats have counted on for decades and trying to win over independents who have been lukewarm about his candidacy… the new list includes women, an Indian American and Black Americans.”\n\nWhen Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, many people predicted the war would last no more than a few weeks, with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces emerging victorious. Who has the edge as the war grinds into its third year? “I’m not sure that either side is winning,” said retired US GeneralDavid Petraeus, in a conversation with CNN’sPeter Bergen. “The Russians obviously have been achieving incremental gains, and the Russians do have the init..."}

Donald McEachin, a Virginia Democrat, died Monday, according to a statement from his office. He was 61.\n\n“We are all devastated at the passing of our boss and friend, Congressman Donald McEachin,” Tara Rountree, his chief of staff, said inthe statement. “Valiantly, for years now, we have watched him fight and triumph over the secondary effects of his colorectal cancer from 2013. Tonight, he lost that battle, and the people of Virginia’s Fourth Congressional District lost a hero who always, always fought for them and put them first.”\n\n“Until a new representative is elected, our office will remain open and continue to serve our constituents,” Rountree said.\n\nThe seat will remain vacant until a special election is held. McEachin, who represented Virginia’s 4th Congressional District, which includes the state capital of Richmond, was reelected comfortably earlier this month in the typically Democratic-leaning region.\n\nMcEachin was first elected to Congress in 2016 after serving in both chambers of Virginia’s General Assembly.\n\nIn each role, the Virginia lawmaker championed reforms to US gun laws, environmental protection and affordable health care.\n\n“This really is a dream come true folks,” McEachin told supporters in his 2016 victory speech. “We know we’re out here making history and that history doesn’t come easy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he and the first lady were saddened by McEachin’s passing and that he will “always be grateful for his friendship, and his early and fierce support when I ran for President.”\n\n“He fought for justice, for civil rights, and for communities that are often left behind. Thanks to Don’s leadership and tireless advocacy, we passed historic legislation to combat the climate crisis and advance environmental justice,” Biden wrote in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nThe son of an Army veteran and a public school teacher, McEachin graduated from American University with a degree in Political Science and from the University of Virginia School of Law. He also received a Master of Divinity from The Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University, according to hisHouse biography.\n\nNews of McEachin’s death was met with warm remembrances from those who knew him.\n\n“Up until the very end, Don McEachin was a fighter. Even though he battled cancer and faced other trials in recent years, he never lost his focus on social and environmental justice,” Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia tweeted. “Tonight, Virginia has lost a great leader and I have lost a great friend.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia similarly hailed McEachin as an exemplary civil servant.\n\n“I met Donald McEachin in 1985 – we became fast friends.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View moreopinionon CNN.\n\nThe so-called “Justice for J6” rally, a right-wing protest Saturday to support the insurrectionists facing criminal charges in the January 6 attack, was smaller than expected. It also lacked the mayhem and violence the Department of Homeland Securityfearedmight break out.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it wasn’t dangerous.\n\nThe rally in Washington, DC, was part of a dangerous attempt to rewrite the history of that dark day in America.\n\nFor months, Trump spread baseless lies about widespread election fraud, claimed the election had been “stolen,” and urged his followers totake action. It didn’t help that many Republican members of Congress repeated those lies. Fueled by the false belief that they were defending democracy, members of the mob stormed the Capitol building while Congress was certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, chanting, “Stop the steal,” and “Hang Mike Pence.”\n\nNow, it seems the organization behind “Justice for J6,” which is led by a former Trump campaign operative, wants to free many of the insurrectionists of responsibility and cast them as victims. Apermit applicationthe organizers submitted to the US Capitol Police Boardsaidthe event was supposed to “bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent Jan. 6 political prisoners.”\n\nTrump has already given credence to this narrative in a statement that repeated the Big Lie. “Our hearts and minds are with the people being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election,” Trumpsaidon Thursday. Although the claims being made about thelegal processdon’t match the facts, this narrative has already taken root.\n\nRelated articleA big win for Gavin Newsom, but a bigger defeat for the GOP\n\nShortly after January 6, many Congressional Republicans condemned Trump anddistanced themselvesfrom the violence. In February, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellsaid, “Former President Trump’s actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful, disgraceful dereliction of duty.” He went on to add, “There’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.”\n\nThe sense of outrage didn’t last long. Republicans soon embarked on an effort to rewrite the narrative. Manydownplayedordeniedthe violence, and Rep. Andrew Clyde went so far as to compare what happened to a“normal tourist visit.”Many other Congressional Republicans stopped talking about January 6 altogether while others worked to prevent abipartisan commissionfrom being established. The goal was to move on, with an eye toward the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Trump continued to distort the facts by falsely claiming that the crowds in Washington that day were peaceful. The rioters, he said, were“hugging and kissing the police and the guards.”False suggestions that Antifa or Black Lives Matterwere responsiblefor the riot picked up steam on social media and right-wing radio shows.\n\nAccording to a newlyreleased pollby the Public Religion Research Institute, those lies have taken hold among the right. While most Americans blame Trump, White supremacists and the conservative media for January 6, a majority of Republicans, see it differently – and place most of the blame on liberal or left-wing activists.\n\nRelated articleMilley's reasonable actions raise a serious question\n\nThis is incredibly dangerous – not only because these are distortions and lies but also because they diminish what little chance our elected leaders have to hold Trump and his enablers accountable.\n\nTo be sure, some Republicans, such as former President George W. Bush have pushed back. On the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attack, Bush delivered a speech in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, comparing domestic extremists to international ones. “They are children of the same foul spirit and it is our continuing duty to confront them,” he said.\n\nBut those voices are all too rare. More common are the Republicans whoremain silentas Trump and others spout lies about the January 6 attack and who was really involved.\n\nWe live in an era of disinformation and conspiracy theories. Trump could be on the cusp, as Jonathan Chaitarguedin New York Magazine, of transforming this disaster into “a glorious uprising behind which he could rally his adherents.”\n\nAs the midterm elections heat up, it is important that Americans are not fooled. The implications of the attack on Congress – which was directly connected to a presidentially-led effort to overturn the election – can’t be forgotten or excused.\n\nStay up to date on the latest o..."}

He also tore in PresidentJoe Biden's handling of the influx of migrants coming into the country and demanded the president \"return Texas land to Texas.\"\n\nThe Republican governor also announced that Texas is funding a $250 million down payment to help pay for a border wall. \"It's more than enough to hire a project manager and contractor to begin building the wall. We are committed to adding more resources as needed going forward,\" Abbott said.\n\nThe governor sat at a desk with a small sign in front of him that read \"borderwall.texas.gov,\" the web address where he is directing potential contributors to give donations to help Texas build its own wall.\n\nAbbott spoke of more than $1 billion being allocated from the state budget toward border security, saying that since the federal government is not enforcing federal immigration laws, \"Texas taxpayers are having to step up.\"\n\nFurther criticism was leveled at Biden when he pointed toward the number of migrants that border security has recently apprehended. In April 2020, Abbott noted, 17,000 people were stopped by security personnel, compared to the more than 170,000 stopped in April of this year. He said those coming into the state were causing \"carnage\" to ranch properties and crops.\n\n\"Homes are being invaded, neighborhoods are dangerous, and people are being threatened on a daily basis with guns,\" Abbott said.\n\nHe also claimed states across the entire country were being affected by security breaches at the border, citing an increase in fentanyl coming into the U.S. and being distributed throughout the nation. He said, \"Remember that the border was far more under control under the Trump administration...\"\n\nTherefore, Abbott said he felt compelled to fight back against the \"tidal wave of illegal immigrants\" by announcing during a summit last week that the state would build its own wall. During an appearance on the right-wing podcastRuthlessreleased Tuesday, Abbott explained that a website would be set up to accept donations to pay for the initiative.\n\nOn Wednesday, he provided the web address for that site—as seen on the desk sign—as well as gave a P.O. Box address for people to send in donations. Abbott also stated that the wall would be built on land owned by the state of Texas or local governments, in addition to land owned by private citizens who volunteered it.\n\nAbbott said he believed the combination of various land already available \"will yield hundreds of miles to build the border wall in Texas.\" Before he could give specific numbers regarding the costs, he said a program manager and contractors would first need to calculate a more accurate estimate.\n\nReferring to the previous attempt by former PresidentDonald Trumpto build a wall, he said that the state should take over the project. He then demanded that the Biden administration \"immediately return to Texans land the federal government took to build the wall. Texas will talk to those property owners about Texans using that land to build the wall.\"\n\nCritics have claimed Abbott is overly concerned about the wall when he should be focused on the possibility of power outages this summer, and some have suggested he has been using the border issues as a distraction.\n\nIn February, the state experienced unprecedented outages during a winter storm due to grid problems from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates most of the state's electricity. ERCOT sent alerts on Monday and Tuesday that asked customers to conserve energy as the increasing heat in Texas is putting a strain on the company's systems.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter about the situation with ERCOT following his announcement about the wall, Abbott said the \"energy grid in Texas now is better than it's ever been.\"\n\nNewsweekcontacted Abbott's office for further comment but did not hear back in time for publication.\n\n©2025Newsweek Digital LLC"}

Mark Milley and Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command, contradicted President Joe Biden’s claim last month that top military advisers didn’t recommend keeping a residual force in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a Sept. 28Senate hearing, both generals said they believe the U.S. should have left a residual force of at least 2,500 troops, and that Biden received those recommendations.\n\nBut in aninterviewwith George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Aug. 18, Biden denied that his decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan went against the advice of his top military advisers.\n\nStephanopoulos, Aug, 18: But your top military advisers warned against withdrawing on this timeline. They wanted you to keep about 2,500 troops.\n\nBiden: No, they didn’t. It was split. Tha– that wasn’t true. That wasn’t true.\n\nStephanopoulos: They didn’t tell you that they wanted troops to stay?\n\nBiden: No. Not at — not in terms of whether we were going to get out in a time frame all troops. They didn’t argue against that.\n\nStephanopoulos: So no one told — your military advisers did not tell you, “No, we should just keep 2,500 troops. It’s been a stable situation for the last several years. We can do that. We can continue to do that”?\n\nBiden: No. No one said that to me that I can recall.\n\nTwo days after that interview,we wrotethat Biden’s recollection was contradicted by reporting from theNew York Times,Wall Street JournalandWashington Post, all of which reported, citing unnamed sources, that early in Biden’s presidency, top military officials recommended Biden keep a small residual force in Afghanistan.\n\nNow Biden’s claim is contradicted by firsthand sources — the generals themselves.\n\nAt the Sept. 28 hearing, Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe said that during a closed, classified hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier in September, Gen. Austin “Scott” Miller, then the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said that he recommended in January that the U.S. keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nInhofeasked McKenzieif he agreed with that recommendation.\n\n“I won’t share my personal recommendation to the president, but I will give you my honest opinion, and my honest opinion and view shaped my recommendation,” McKenzie said. “I recommended that we maintain 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. And I also recommended earlier in the fall of 2020 that we maintain 4,500 at that time. Those were my personal views. I also have a view that the withdrawal of those forces would lead inevitably to the collapse of the Afghan military forces and eventually the Afghan government.”\n\n(The recommendation in the fall of 2020 would have been made to then-President Donald Trump.)\n\nInhofe then asked Milley if he agreed with the recommendation to keep 2,500 forces in Afghanistan.\n\nMilley said, “I do agree with that,” noting that he put his opinion in a memo that he wrote back in the fall of 2020 when Trump was president.\n\nInhofe asked McKenzie if he ever spoke to Biden about Miller’s recommendation.\n\n“I was present when that discussion occurred,” McKenzie said. “And I’m confident the president heard all the recommendations, and listened to them very thoughtfully.”\n\nThe issue wasagain raisedduring the hearing by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton.\n\n“I don’t discuss exactly what my conversations are with the sitting president in the Oval Office,” Milley said. “But I can tell you what my personal opinion was and I am always candid.”\n\nMilley said it was assessment “back in the fall of ’20 and remained consistent throughout” that the U.S. should keep 2,500 to 3,500 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nMcKenzie said he “share[d] that assessment.”\n\nAsked if Miller ever presented that opinion personally to Biden, McKenzie said, “I believe his opinion was well heard.”\n\nCotton then turned his attention to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Biden’s interview with ABC News, in which Biden said that he did not recall senior military leaders advising him to leave a small troop presence in Afghanistan.\n\n“Is that true?” Cotton asked.\n\n“First of all, I know the president to be an honest and forthright man,” Austin said. But he confirmed that the “input” from Milley, McKenzie and Miller “was received by the president and considered by the president, for sure.”\n\nAsked about the seeming contradiction at a daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psakiemphasizedthat in the interview, Biden said the advice on the withdrawal timeline and whether to keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan was “split.” She declined to say which military advisers disagreed with Milley, McKenzie and Miller. “I’m not going to get into specific details of who recommended what,”Psaki said.\n\nPsaki also said that the question put to Biden was whether military advisers told him, “We should just keep 2,500 troops.

Here, storage tanks at a Colonial Pipeline facility are seen Wednesday in Avenel, N.J.\n\nPresident Biden signed anexecutive orderWednesday boosting America's cyberdefenses following a ransomware attack on a company that operates a pipeline that provides nearly half of the gasoline and jet fuel for the country's East Coast.\n\nThe broad order, which the administration had been working on for months, aims to strengthen cybersecurity for federal networks and outline new security standards for commercial software used by both business and the public.\n\n\"Recent cybersecurity incidents such as SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange, and the Colonial Pipeline incident are a sobering reminder that U.S. public and private sector entities increasingly face sophisticated malicious cyber activity from both nation-state actors and cyber criminals,\" the White House fact sheet says.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters Wednesday, a senior Biden administration official said that the order \"reflects a fundamental shift in our mindset from incident response to prevention, from talking about security to doing security.\"\n\nAsNPR first reported last month, the order lays out a series of new requirements for companies that do business with the federal government.\n\nThe administration's goal is not only to boost federal defenses but also to use the purchasing power of the government to get those higher standards to trickle down to the private sector.\n\nThe administration also wants to pilot a program like those Energy Star ratings on appliances so consumers know if software was developed securely.\n\n\"We see small companies being forced to pay a ransom to get their business back up and running,\" Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology at the White House, told NPR's Dina Temple-Raston in a recent interview. \"You know, we see school systems' networks down due to criminals. So those risks touch everyday Americans' lives, as well as at the national level.\"\n\nBiden's order requires companies to report certain information about cyberbreaches. It updates security standards on government networks, including mandating multifactor authentication and encryption. And it creates a playbook for cyber-incident response by federal agencies.\n\nIt also establishes a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board to analyze incidents. It's modeled on the National Transportation Safety Board, which reviews airplane crashes and incidents with other modes of transportation.\n\nThe order comes in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline hack and after other recent cyberattacks. (Colonial had justrestartedits pipeline earlier Wednesday.)\n\nA focus on Russia\n\nWhile cyberthreats come from all over the world, the pipeline attack brought focus back to Russia, because Biden says the alleged criminal group has ties to the country.\n\nBiden expects to meet with his Russian counterpart soon. He suggested this could be a topic of discussion.\n\n\"I'm going to be meeting with President [Vladimir] Putin, and so far there is no evidence based on, from our intelligence people, that Russia is involved, although there's evidence that the actors' ransomware is in Russia,\" Biden has said. \"They have some responsibility to deal with this.\"\n\nThe two are expected to meet during Biden's trip overseas to meet with European leaders next month.\n\nMatthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, who is close to the administration, said both governments are vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nHe said it's in both of their interests to start a conversation on rules of engagement, which he added could be part of larger plans to discuss arms control and security.\n\n\"And you can start just by laying out red lines and talking about deterrence,\" he said. \"You know, 'If you do X, we do Y, and you don't want Y, so don't do X,' but you can move from there eventually, build a little bit of working trust and possibly establish an actual framework that looks like arms control.\"\n\nThe administration has made clear, though, that the cyberthreat goes well beyond Russia.\n\n\"It's not specifically a bilateral problem; it's also a China problem,\" said Ari Schwartz, who served as cybersecurity director in the Obama White House. \"It's a problem with Iran and North Korea, and it's also a problem with a criminal issue. It's all of those things, and the Biden administration said that very directly on several occasions.\"\n\nThe Biden administration says for too long the government and the country have failed to take the necessary steps to boost defenses.\n\n\"These are systems that we use to run government and conduct commerce — systems that are used to deliver our power and ou..."}

The unusual disclosure came as the Biden administration has sought to pre-empt Russian tactics, which during previous conflicts have obscured the facts and made it more difficult for the U.S. and its allies to hold Moscow accountable.\n\nFor weeks, as concerns have grown about a potential Russian invasion, U.S. national security officials have warned publicly that Russia was likely to spread misinformation about ongoing diplomatic efforts to muddy the waters and to try to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its NATO and European allies.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday at her daily briefing that the intelligence shows Russia \"is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion.\"\n\nPsaki added that Russians appear to be following the same playbook they used when theytook control of Crimea.\n\n\"We saw this before, leading up to 2014, just to note — through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces,\" Psaki said.

The only explanation from the Pentagon is that there isn’t a “substantive rationale for it,” which will surprise the Polish and the Ukrainians.

Because the Ukrainian pilots are trained on Russian-designed MiGs, it would not be a good idea to send or lend them American jets such as F-15s or F-22s — there simply isn’t time to train them on a new kind of warplane. But NATO members Poland, Slovakia, and Bulgaria fly MiG-29s and could sell or lend theirs to Ukraine.\n\nMost of Congress seemed persuaded. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska declared in a statement that:\n\nUkraine needs airpower urgently and America should send it. Zelensky’s message is simple: ‘close the skies or give us planes.’ Let’s be clear-eyed about our options: A No-Fly Zone means sending American pilots into combat against Russian jets and air defenses — in a battle between nuclear powers that could spiral out of control quickly. But Americans should absolutely send Ukrainians planes, helicopters, and UAVs. Let’s resupply Ukraine’s Air Force today and keep the Ghosts of Kyiv in the skies.\n\nI’ve seen some defense analysts argue that Poland’s 28 or so MiG-29s wouldn’t make a huge difference in the war. Ukrainian air defenses continue to shoot down Russian jets, and the Russian air force’s role in the invasion so far has been much smaller, and much less effective, than expected. (Then again,a Russian air strike did destroy the Mariupol maternity hospital yesterday. Real tough guys, those Russians.)\n\nBut clearly, Zelensky thinks those MiG-29s would make a difference. And given a choice between having “X” remaining Ukrainian fighter jets, or X+28 fighter jets, we would all prefer the larger air force.\n\nAs of Sunday, the position of the U.S. government,at least as articulated by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was that we wanted the planes to get transferred and would do our part to ensure that the planes got there:\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no-fly zone. President Biden has been very clear he has no interest in that or combat troops. But what more can the United States do here? If, for instance, the Polish government, a NATO member, wants to send fighter jets, does that get a green light from the U.S., or are you afraid that that will escalate tension?\n\nSECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: No, that — that gets a green light. In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs, if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they’re handing over to the Ukrainians? We’re in very active discussions with them about that.\n\nOn Monday,the Pentagon seemed open to the plan:\n\n[PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY JOHN] KIRBY: I can’t speak for Polish leadership. But David, what we’ve said is that this will be a sovereign decision for a nation state to make. Whether it’s Poland or anybody else, that should they want to provide aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force, that’s a sovereign decision that they can make. The United States is not going to stand in the way of that. There is — there was discussion about if a nation such as Poland were to do this, would there be a capacity for the United States to backfill those aircraft with American made aircraft? And what I can tell you is because I can only speak for the Department of Defense is that we are part of an interagency discussion to examine that possibility.\n\nThen on Tuesday afternoon,the Polish government announced they had a deal:\n\nThe authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy — immediately and free of charge — all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.\n\nAt the same time, Poland ..."}

It’s always been to be competitive. And if you’re getting 40% in all the early states, that’s making a point,” she told “CNN News Central.”\n\nFor Trump — who has changed his rhetoric to focus on the general election rather than Haley — Michigan is a predictor for how the former president will do in the state come November.\n\nThe 45th president first visited the Wolverine State in September as the other GOP candidates faced off in the second primary debate in California.

The Russian forces redeployed to Kherson Oblast included its most-effective airborne units, known in Russia as VDV.\n\nSince Russia still falls short of sufficient quality manpower to hold the 1,000-kilometer front line in Ukraine, those units were relocated to Kherson Oblast at the expense of other frontline sections.\n\nUkraine’s military persuaded the Russian command that Kherson would be its counter-offensive's primary, and likely only, axis. Indeed, experts doubted Ukraine had enough weaponry and hardware for a successful major strike at one frontline section, let alone two or more.\n\nUkraine has performed well in this battle with operational security (OPSEC), keeping its adversary poorly informed regarding its planned maneuvers and capabilities.\n\nAnd when the time came, many of Russia’s best combat formations ended up isolated in Kherson, with all bridges crossing the Dnipro River ruined as their backs were turned.\n\nThe destruction of these bridges means there is no way for Russian forces to withdraw, and there will be a drastic decrease in reinforcements and resupply due to a forced reliance on less effective pontoon crossings across the Dnipro.\n\nThen came something few had expected.\n\nOn Sept. 6, Ukrainian forces launched a rapid advance on Balakliia, Kharkiv Oblast, a city with a pre-war population of 27,000 that Russian troops had occupied since early March.\n\nOne of Kharkiv Oblast’s transport hubs, Balakliia also hosts a giant ammunition depot known as the 65th Arsenal.\n\nVerbivka, a village just north of Balakliia, was liberated by Ukrainian forces within a few hours.\n\nThe Ukrainian advance bypassed local cities, leaving Russian garrisons isolated and cut off from their main forces.\n\nThe Ukrainian blitz rushed to Volokhiv Yar, a village some 15 kilometers to the northeast of Balakliia, and toward the villages of Kunie and Vesele, 30 kilometers southeast, taking local roads and junctions under its control.\n\nHighly mobile Ukrainian reconnaissance units moved fast ahead of the main Ukrainian forces in Russian-controlled territory using light vehicles, such as U.S.-provided Humvees.\n\nThey engaged Russian forces sporadically, wreaking havoc and trying to convince Russian troops that they were attacking from every direction.\n\nThe occasional Russian garrison showed little to no resistance in communities along the way.\n\nAs early as the next day, Russia’s weak Rosgravriya and special police units, short on heavy weaponry, managed to flee Balakliia in time.\n\nWhile this was already a success, the Ukrainian blitz liberated the town of Shevchenkove, yet another vital junction, followed by the city of Kupiansk, the operation’s greatest possible prize.\n\nKupiansk, a major railroad hub, was at the heart of Russia’s vital ground line of communication between its territory and occupied Donbas.\n\nCutting off Kupiansk meant derailing Russian supplies in its most critical frontline sector.\n\nContrary to expectations, Russian forces showed little resistance, and Ukrainian troops managed to break through into Sinkove, a community south of Kupiansk.\n\nThis move isolated Kupiansk on the western bank of the Oskil River, which divides the city in half.\n\nThe Russian front line in Kharkiv Oblast just collapse..."}

Both were enthusiastic proponents of societal lockdowns as a means of preventing deaths and the spread of Covid. We now know from a Johns Hopkins blockbuster meta-analysis that “shutting it down,” in Donald Trump’s awkward phrase, did very little to prevent deaths.\n\nIt’s a long, arcane, and detailed analysis, and I can’t present every nuance or statistic here. But I think these are the primary takeaways.From the study:\n\nOverall, we conclude that lockdowns are not an effective way of reducing mortality rates during a pandemic, at least not during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are in line with the World Health Organization Writing Group (2006), who state, “Reports from the 1918 influenza pandemic indicate that social-distancing measures did not stop or appear to dramatically reduce transmission […]\n\nIn Edmonton, Canada, isolation and quarantine were instituted; public meetings were banned; schools, churches, colleges, theaters, and other public gathering places were closed; and business hours were restricted without obvious impact on the epidemic.” Our findings are also in line with Allen’s (2021) conclusion: “The most recent research has shown that lockdowns have had, at best, a marginal effect on the number of Covid 19 deaths.”\n\nWhy might that be?\n\nMandates only regulate a fraction of our potential contagious contacts and can hardly regulate nor enforce handwashing, coughing etiquette, distancing in supermarkets, etc. Countries like Denmark, Finland, and Norway that realized success in keeping COVID-19 mortality rates relatively low allowed people to go to work, use public transport, and meet privately at home during the first lockdown. In these countries, there were ample opportunities to legally meet with others.\n\nWorse, the lockdowns caused tremendous harm:\n\nUnintended consequences may play a larger role than recognized. We already pointed to the possible unintended consequence of SIPOs, which may isolate an infected person at home with his/her family where he/she risks infecting family members with a higher viral load, causing more severe illness. But often, lockdowns have limited peoples’ access to safe (outdoor) places such as beaches, parks, and zoos, or included outdoor mask mandates or strict outdoor gathering restrictions, pushing people to meet at less safe (indoor) places. Indeed, we do find some evidence that limiting gatherings was counterproductive and increased COVID-19 mortality\n\nWhat lessons should be learned (my emphasis)?\n\nThe use of lockdowns is a unique feature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns have not been used to such a large extent during any of the pandemics of the past century. However, lockdowns during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic have had devastating effects.They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy. These costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns, which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best.Such a standard benefit-cost calculation leads to a strong conclusion:lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.\n\nTo which I would add another:We can never squelch free discourse and debate on public-health issues again.\n\nPeople who argued against the “scientific consensus” about the lockdowns were stifled, censored by Big Tech, denigrated by the media, and mocked by establishment scientists. That was essentially “anti-science.” The scientific method needs heterodox voices to speak freely if it is to function properly.\n\nThis subsequent look-back shows why. To a large degree, those with the officiallydisfavored views–such as the signers of theGreat Barrington Declaration—were correcton this matter.\n\nWill we learn the lesson? Yes, if our goal is to ably discern and apply the best policy options, which can be a messy process. No, if the point is to allow those in charge of institutional science to exert societal control.\n\nAs Oscar Wilde might have said, to lose one presidency over economic angst may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.\n\nConcerns such as mental health or body image issues are not contraindications to pediatric patients receiving hormone therapy, according to AAFP.\n\n‘With rising threats to free speech and open debate, the Federalist Society is celebrating the students who every day defend the Constitution.’\n\nIn one email, sent to author Michael Wolff in 2019, Epstein wrote..."}

Britain’s Defense Ministry said that “lead elements have advanced up to 50km (31 miles) into previously Russian-held territory on a narrow front.”\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said in a Telegram post Saturday that “a decision was made to regroup” some of its troops from the Balakliya and Izyum areas — Izyum had been a major base for Moscow's troops — and transfer them to Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.\n\nThe move was made “in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas,’” the ministry said, referring to the industrial heartland in Ukraine's east that became the focal point of the Kremlin's war after it was forced to give up on its assault on the capital, Kyiv.\n\nThe ministry had earlier shared video showing military vehicles that it said were rushing to the aid of its forces in the east.\n\nSeparately, a Moscow-installed official in the region conceded that Ukrainian troops had made gains.\n\n“The very fact of the breakthrough is a significant victory for them,” Vitaly Ganchev, who leads the Kremlin-controlled government in the occupied territory in Kharkiv province, said Friday in an appearance on Russian state TV.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putinpromised earlier this weektopush on with Moscow's military efforts in Ukraine, saying that his country was gaining rather than losing from the conflict.\n\nEvents on the battlefield appeared to paint a bleak picture for the Kremlin, however.\n\nUkraine initially launched a counteroffensive in the country’s south late last month after weeks of public buildup and preparation, as it aimed to push toward the crucial coastal city of Kherson.\n\nThen this week, after Russia redeployed large numbers of its own forces to the south to combat that effort, reports began to emerge of Kyiv’s forces launching another counteroffensive farther north — a move that appeared to catch both the broader world and Moscow’s military off guard.\n\n“Either the Russians were too incompetent to see it, or they were so incompetent they saw it and couldn’t do anything,” Phillips O’Brien, chairman of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said earlier this week. “And neither of those are comforting for them.”\n\nSome Western military analysts said the advance appeared aimed at shutting off supply and communication lines Russia has relied on to sustain its forces in eastern Ukraine, and could potentially leave thousands of Russian troops encircled.\n\nSuch sweeping advances on either side largely unheard of in a grinding, attritional conflict.\n\nGlen Grant, a retired British officer who worked as a defense reform expert in Ukraine before the war, said there remained some questions about the success of the counteroffensive. For instance, had Ukraine beaten back Russian forces or were they “driving into fresh air?”\n\n\"In other words, there's nobody there,\" he said, adding that he wanted to know if Ukraine was laying down strong supply lines and artillery support as it moved forward.\n\nA Reuters journalist inside a vast area recaptured by the advancing Ukrainian forces in recent days saw burned-out vehicles bearing the “Z” symbol of Moscow’s invasion, and boxes of ammunition lying in heaps at positions abandoned by fleeing Russian soldiers.\n\nThe United States had expressed cautious optimism about Ukraine’s counteroffensive, with the Pentagon saying Kyiv’s forces were putting Western-supplied weapons to good use.\n\n“We see success in Kherson now, we see some success in Kharkiv and so that is very, very..."}

John Kasichof legislation that would have banned abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy.\n\nThe legislature convened in a rare post-Christmas session Thursday to try to override the veto of the legislation, which has been dubbed the “heartbeat bill.” The House overrode the veto, but the Senate did not.\n\nThe legislation would have banned abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, at roughly six to eight weeks into a pregnancy, and it did not have exemptions for rape or incest.\n\nIn a statement issued before the state Senate vote on Thursday, Marshal Pitchford, chairman of the Ohio Right to Life board of trustees, said the group “believes that it is now time to embrace the heartbeat bill as the next incremental approach to end abortion in Ohio.” He vowed that anti-abortion groups would work to get it passed under the new session.\n\nProponents hope that measures like the Ohio legislation will be enacted and challenged in court, eventually making their way to the Supreme Court. The court’s ideological makeup has become conservative under President Trump after he appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIf taken up, abortion cases could result in a weakening or overruling ofRoe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide for up to fetal viability, roughly understood at about 24 weeks into a pregnancy.Overruling the lawwould turn decision-making about whether to legalize abortion over to the states.\n\n“With the additions of Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court we believe this is the most pro-life court we have seen in generations,” Pitchford said. “Now is the time to pursue this approach.”\n\nKasich had vetoed the bill in Ohio because he said it violatedRoe, but he did sign another measure into law that would imprison doctors who perform an abortion method commonly used during the second trimester, known as dilation and evacuation. Kasich will be leaving office at the beginning of 2019 and Gov.-elect Mike DeWine, also a Republican, supports the heartbeat measure.\n\nNotifications"}

The spectre of a shutdown is always out there.\"\n\nHowever, one of the Democratic negotiators, Jon Tester, said there was still hope that a deal could be reached in time. Also speaking to Fox News, he said: \"Negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through.\"\n\nAs wall discussions labour on, Mr Trump plans on sending over 3,700 active troops to the US-Mexico border to help agents with security efforts this month. With over 2,000 troops already at the border, the new deployment would top November's election-time numbers of 5,900.\n\nMeanwhile, pushing back against the Trump administration's call for border states to help with security, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom says he will recall hundreds of the state's national guard from the border.\n\nGov Newsom's move follows his Democratic colleague, Gov Michelle Grisham of New Mexico, who pulled her state's troops from the border last week.\n\nBoth governors have cited the withdrawal as a retaliation against Mr Trump's \"fear-mongering\".\n\nOn 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement.\n\nThat funding ends at midnight on Friday.Another short-term deal could prevent a new shutdown, according to the New York Times.\n\nMr Trump -who has suggested the talks are a \"waste of time\"- made building a wall on the border with Mexico one of his key promises in the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe president has backed away from his calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall but during his State of the Union speech last Tuesday - delayed because of the previous shutdown - he insisted on a \"smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier\".\n\nHe has previously threatened to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without Congress. But this idea is disliked even by some fellow Republicans and Democrats are likely to challenge it in courts.\n\nMr Trump said on Saturdaythe wall would \"get built one way or the other!\"He is set to hold a rally in the border city of El Paso, in Texas, later on Monday to gather support for his wall.\n\nAhead of his visit,local officials denounced the president's remarksthat a fence built there more than a decade ago reduced criminality.\n\nFederal agencies including the departments of Homeland Security, State, Agriculture and Commerce could lose access to money and begin to close down again, affecting about 800,000 federal employees, who would go unpaid.\n\nDuring a shutdown, essential services continue to operate, with workers being required to show up. Last time, some employees continued to work unpaid but many others called in sick.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Knippertz, File)\n\nDUSSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday intensified a crackdown on media outlets and individuals who fail to hew to the Kremlin line onRussia’s war in Ukraine, blocking Facebook and Twitter and signing into law a bill that criminalizes the intentional spreading of what Moscow deems to be “fake” reports.\n\nThe moves against the social media giants follow blocks imposed on the BBC, the U.S. government-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and Latvia-based website Meduza. The government’s sweeping action against the foreign outlets that publish news in Russian seeks to establish even tighter controls over what information the domestic audience sees about the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it cut access to Twitter and Facebook in line with a decision by the prosecutor general’s office. The watchdog has previously accused Twitter of failing to delete the content banned by Russian authorities and slowed down access to it.\n\nTwitter said in a statement Friday afternoon that while the company is “aware of reports” that its platform is blocked in Russia, it has not been able to confirm whether this is the case.\n\nThe bill, quickly rubber-stamped by both houses of the Kremlin-controlled parliament and signed by Putin, imposes prison sentences of up to 15 years for those spreading information that goes against the Russian government’s narrative on the war.\n\nThe question regarding Russia is no longer “what we do to stop disinformation,” former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said on Friday. “The question has to be how do we promote information inside Russia -- and I don’t have the answer.”\n\nMultiple outlets said they would pause their work inside Russia to evaluate the situation. Among them, CNN and CBS News said they would stop broadcasting in Russia while Bloomberg and the BBC said they would temporarily suspend the work of their journalists there.\n\nRussian authorities have repeatedly and falsely decried reports of Russian military setbacks or civilian deaths in Ukraine as “fake” news. State media outlets refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” rather than a war or an invasion.\n\nVyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, said the measure “will force those who lied and made statements discrediting our armed forces to bear very grave punishment.”\n\n“I want everyone to understand, and for society to understand, that we are doing this to protect our soldiers and officers, and to protect the truth,” he added.\n\nThe law envisages sentences of up to three years or fines for spreading what authorities deem to be false news about the military, but the maximum punishment rises to 15 years for cases deemed to have led to “severe consequences.”\n\nIn blocking Facebook, Roskomnadzor cited its alleged “discrimination” of the Russian media and state information resources. The agency said in a statement that the restrictions introduced by Facebook owner Meta on the Russian news channel RT and other state-controlled media violate Russian law.\n\n“Obviously Putin is shutting these people down because he is afraid. He wouldn’t be shutting them down if everything was going peachy keen,” McFaul said during a call with reporters and experts hosted by Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center. “This is an indicator of his state of mind.”\n\nNick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said tweeted in response to Russia’s action that “millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friend..."}

Bulk list messaging requires recipients to opt-in to receive communications from an automated sender, such as the Biden campaign’s “30330” and Trump campaign’s “88022” blasts or even online retailers.\n\nSenders may seek to grow their own reach by either building those lists organically or purchasing numbers from lists owned by other groups or private communications companies.\n\nHOUSE GOP DIGITAL FUNDRAISING ARM OUTRAISES DEMOCRATS FOR FIRST TIME\n\nThe DNC official said thatPolitico“didn’t do a great job” and “fueled a lot of embellishment and speculation” about the new initiative. That new process sees communications officials take the misleading bulk texts about vaccines flagged by volunteers and then forward them to SMS aggregator companies, such asTwilioorBandwidth, “who either work with a mass texting client or have companies that work with mass texting clients,” the official said.\n\nThose aggregator companies all have “fair use and abuse” policies but “almost all of the time” have no visibility on what their clients are actually sending, “so all we do is say, ‘Hey, did you know that you were sending out these messages?'” the official added.\n\n“The idea that, like, Joe Biden is reading everyone’s text messages, that’s not what happening,” the DNC official said.\n\nSources on both sides noted that federal law prohibits SMS carriers from monitoring P2P messaging without a warrant, although carriers may deploy machine learning technology to block some bulk messages that violate fair use practices from being delivered.\n\nWhite House officials also told theWashington Examinerthat though some administration officials, such as White House press secretaryJen Psakiand Dr.Anthony Fauci, have ramped up efforts to publicly dispute vaccine misinformation, the administration itself has nothing to do with the DNC initiative.\n\n“We are steadfastly committed to keeping politics out of the effort to get every American vaccinated so that we can save lives and help our economy further recover,” White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz previously toldPolitico. “When we see deliberate efforts to spread misinformation, we view that as an impediment to the country’s public health and will not shy away from calling that out.”\n\nConservatives reacted with ire on social media toPolitico’sreport, and some right-leaningtelevision programstold their viewers that the president and his party were working to monitor their private text messages.\n\nYOUNG ADULTS SANK BIDEN’S VACCINE GOAL.

Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya speaks at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday before a vote on a resolution condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday approved a nonbinding resolution condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and demanding that it withdraw its military forces.\n\nThe vote came after a series of speeches during which the majority of countries called on Russia to end the violence in Ukraine, which has continued for nearly one week.\n\nSergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.N., urged countries to vote in favor of the resolution in an emotional address that ended with applause from the chamber.\n\n\"It's already clear that the goal of Russia is not an occupation only. It is genocide,\" Kyslytsya said.\n\nVassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the U.N., asked members to vote against the resolution and said Western powers were exerting pressure on other countries to vote in favor of it. Belarus and Syria were among the countries that spoke out against the resolution.\n\nUltimately, the resolution passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 141-5 with 35 abstentions. The five countries that voted against it were Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea.\n\n\"The truth is that this war was one man's choice and one man alone: President Putin. It was his choice to force hundreds of thousands of people to stuff their lives into backpacks and flee the country,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\n\"Those were President Putin's choices. Now it is time to make ours. The United States is choosing to stand with the Ukrainian people,\" she added.\n\nThe measure's passage showed that \"a global anti-Putin coalition has been formed and is functioning,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid in a tweetafter the vote.\n\n\"The world is with us. The truth is on our side. Victory will be ours!\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nThe vote cameamid multiple efforts to wall off Russia diplomatically, a surge in the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine, an initial estimate that the humanitarian effort within the country will cost more than $1 billion, and an emergency, often heated debate at the General Assembly. None of the diplomatic activities appeared to slow Russia's attacks Wednesday morning, as new reports said Russian airstrikes had hit a regional police headquarters in Kharkiv, injuring three people.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, singling out Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in her speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday, said the war was based on lies.\n\n\"Mr. Lavrov, you can deceive yourself, but you won't deceive us. And you won't deceive our people and you won't deceive your own people,\" she said.\n\nRussian diplomats, including Nebenzia, have called the attacks against Ukraine a \"special military operation\" intended to defend two separatist regions.\n\n\"Russia is seeking to end this war,\" Nebenzia said earlier this week.\n\nThe resolution \"demands that the Russian Federation immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\" It also expresses \"grave concern at reports of attacks on civilian facilities such as residences, schools, and hospitals, and of civilian casualties, including women, older persons, persons with disabilities, and children.\"\n\nLast week, Russia vetoed a similar resolution at the 15-member Security Council. It was mostly isolated: No other nation opposed it, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained. Eleven nations, including the United States, supported it.\n\n\"No state should be able to get away with what Russia got away with without facing diplomatic isolation,\" Samuel Charap, a political scientist at the Rand Corp.said. \"The question is, does it alter the course of the war, really? And there, it doesn't seem likely.\"\n\nThe United Arab Emirates assumed the rotating chair of the Security Council on Tuesday, and Lana Nusseibeh, the UAE's permanent representative to the U.N., became president of the Security Council on Monday. She said Monday that the UAE's abstention from the Security Council's resolution would not affect how it chairs the panel.\n\n\"We must leave space for a diplomatic off-ramp,\" she said. \"Those countries that did abstain have those channels with President Putin and will use them to help.\"\n\nShe did not say whether the UAE would abstain from Wednesday's General Assembly vote. The United Arab Emirates did not co-sponsor the resolution.\n\nSeparately, the United Nations said on Tuesday it estimates the initial humanitarian and refugee needs will cost $1.7 billion. U.N.

New York does not have the death penalty.\n\nThe 19-year-old killer initially pleaded not guilty to the state charges in June.\n\n\"I understand this is a momentous and tremendously emotional event,\" Judge Susan Eagan said in court on Monday.\n\nThe judge named each victim and asked the gunman if he had killed them because of their race. He showed little emotion as he said \"yes\" to each charge.\n\nThe charges include first-degree murder, murder as a hate crime, and domestic terrorism motivated by hate.\n\nThe gunman is also facing multiple federal charges over the 14 May shooting, which could be punished with the death penalty.\n\nThe attack happened after the gunman drove more than 320km (200 miles) across the state to a predominantly black neighbourhood in Buffalo, New York's second-largest city.\n\nPayton Gendron, dressed in military gear, drove into the car park at the city's Tops Friendly Market and began livestreaming the shooting spree from a camera fastened to his head.\n\nAll of the 10 people who were killed were black. Three others were wounded.\n\nThe victims ranged in age from 32 to 86. They included eight shoppers, a store security guard and a church deacon that drove people to and from the store to do their shopping.\n\n\"Our client pled guilty to every count of the indictment with the full knowledge that he will spend the rest of his life in prison with no chance of parole,\" the gunman's lawyer Brian Parker said after Monday's court hearing.\n\n\"This critical step represents a condemnation of the racist ideology that fuelled his horrific actions,\" Mr Parker added.\n\nHe said the surviving victims and relatives of those killed would have the opportunity to address the gunman in court on 15 February.\n\nBuffalo Mayor Byron Brown said the suspect had travelled to the supermarket with the specific intention of ending \"as many black lives as possible\". The mayor was present on Monday in the courtroom, a short distance from where the attack occurred.\n\nA 180-page document seemingly authored by the alleged attacker has since emerged, in which he describes himself as a fascist and a white supremacist.\n\nLast week, a lawyer for the victims' families said they expected the guilty plea because it would avoid \"a lengthy trial that... would be very difficult for the families\".\n\n\"I think it was pretty clear that they had no real defence,\" lawyer Terrence Connors, who represents the families of some of the victims, told NBC News.\n\nMeanwhile, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn noted that the case marked the first time a person had been charged under a 2020 state law against domestic terrorism motivated by hate.\n\nSpeaking outside the court, he called the plea \"swift justice\".\n\nCivil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump, who is representing some of the families of victims, called for the attacker to be given the \"most-harsh sentence\" possible.\n\n\"We don't want it to be marginalised because these were black people,\" he said. \"We want the whole world to never let this be swept under the rug.\"\n\nEven if the budget swiftly clears Congress, it will still take days to reopen the government.\n\nThe spending plan may have passed the Senate, but it's not yet a done deal in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nRepublicans sound confident the bill will pass, despite their narrow majority.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Jim Banks (R-IN) over concerns that the two GOP Members would impact the “integrity of the investigation.”\n\nMcCarthy announced his picks for the Select Committee on Monday, balancing out three more moderate Republicans with two supporters of former President Donald Trump, likely in order to ensure that Pelosi seated the full complement of GOP appointees alongside her own Democrat appointees and her hand-selected Republican panel members, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nBanks, after being appointed, said he would “force Democrats and the media” to “answer questions so far ignored. Among them, why was the Capitol so unprepared and vulnerable to attack on January 6th?”\n\nHe also suggested that he would try to steer the Select Committee towards investigating political violence more broadly, probing not just the January 6th riot, but also ongoing violence in Democrat-run cities like Portland, Oregon.\n\nMy statement on being appointed by @GOPLeader to serve as the Republican ranking member on the Select Committee to investigate Jan. 6:pic.twitter.com/dSJNF56EA9\n\n— Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks)July 19, 2021\n\nBut McCarthy appointed three other panelists who are unlikely to be Trump allies, Republican Reps.

One was quoted as saying Biden “wants to run and he’s clearly letting everyone know”.\n\nIt was not clear when Biden told Obama his plans. But Obama visited the White House earlier this month, to celebrate the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIntroducing his host, Obamacalledhim “Vice-President Biden”.\n\n“That was a joke,” he said, to laughter.\n\nBiden was vice-president to Obama from 2009 to 2017. He won the presidency on his own third attempt in 2020 (after short-lived campaigns in 1988 and 2008), beatingDonald Trump.\n\nAt 78, Biden was the oldest president ever inaugurated. If he won again he would be 82 at the start of his second term.\n\nAmid competing crises, from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the coronavirus and rampant inflation at home, Biden’s approval ratings have plummeted. Most observers expect Republicans to retake Congress in November. But the president has dropped plenty of hints that he does plan to run again.\n\nIn September, it waswidely reportedthat Biden and aides had told allies he planned to run again. In December, Bidensaidhe would run if he stayed in good health. He has also said Kamala Harris, his vice-president, would be on the ticket again.\n\nIn his December interviewwith ABC News, Biden said another Trump candidacy would “increase the prospect of running”.\n\nIn Brussels in March, Biden referred to Trump again when hesaid: “In the next election, I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.”\n\nTrump, 75, is readying his own third run for the presidency.\n\nOne of the sources who spoke to the Hill said Biden “thinks he’s the only one who can beat Trump. I don’t think he thinks there’s anyone in the Democratic party who can beat Trump and that’s the biggest factor.”\n\nIn 2020, Biden surged to victory in the Democratic primary on the back of support from Black voters – and a quickly gathering sense that he was indeed the party’s best hope of beating Trump.\n\nAccording to books and reportage about the 2020 campaign, Obama doubted whether Biden could win.\n\nEdward-Isaac Dovere, author of Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats’ Campaigns to Defeat Trump, reports: “Obama was doubtful about [Biden’s] prospects. He didn’t think Biden could be a disciplined enough candidate.”\n\nDovere also says Obama doubted Biden’s stamina for the race, was not sure he had the requisite “swagger” for an American president, and worried his vice-president had “trouble … connecting with crowds”.\n\nBut Dovere also quotes Jen Psaki, now Biden’s White House press secretary, as saying Obama “undervalued Biden’s political abilities because they had such different styles”."}

Spoiler alert: It's full of transphobic lies.\n\nThe right-wing web is buzzing about the recently released anti-trans documentaryWhat is a Woman?fromDaily Wirecolumnist Matt Walsh. Everyone else seems to be ignoring it. And while I don’t fault the many film critics who allegedly declined to review the film, I decided to run toward the dumpster fire. Ignorance can indeed be frightening, but it must be confronted.\n\nThe propaganda project garnered push back even before its June 1 release, when trans activist Eli Erlick accused Walsh of seeking interviews under false pretenses. Erlick, who is a founder of theTrans Student Educational Project, took to Twitter in February to warn community members that the “Gender Unity Project” was not what it seemed.\n\nIt’s telling that the project’s Twitter accounthas since been suspendedand its websiteno longer exists. Erlick’s claims were confirmed by other members of the transgender community who had been contacted by people involved in the film.\n\nSo@MattWalshBlog's crew is trying to trick trans people into joining a fake documentary. His producers set up a whole front organization (@GenderUnityProj)  and tried to recruit me into his next anti-trans documentary. Here's the wild story of how it went down (1/x):pic.twitter.com/Kqy3x5oZQe\n\nThe resulting documentary is framedas an earnest inquiry into womanhood, but Walsh’s anti-trans agenda is clear from the start. No matter how many times he repeats the central question, Walsh is really asking: “Are trans people crazy or what?” and inviting viewers to join him in his conclusion that gender transition is a threat to both individuals and society.\n\nThe film opens on a birthday party scene so heavily gendered it calls to mind “But I’m a Cheerleader.” Boys are decked out in blues while girls are adorned in pinks. The boy gets a football while the girl gets a tiara. In a voice-over, Walsh reminisces about the differences between raising boys and girls.\n\n“I got my son a BB gun, and that’s about all the emotional support he needs,” Walsh says, while the boy in the video holds a gun. “Some people say there’s no difference between the sexes. Those people are idiots.”\n\nThe film is slickly produced and includes interviews with some reputable sources. But Walsh seems more interested in “exposing” these experts than actually learning from them. He also allows his anti-transgender sources to spout off dangerous disinformation unchecked.\n\nStill, Walsh seems to think he “owned the libs,” claiming that supporters of transgender people can’t debunk his film.\n\nThe Left is terrified of the film. It’s that simple. If they thought they could debunk it they would. If they thought it was poorly made they’d make fun of it for that. But they can’t debunk it and it’s well made, so they cower and hope it goes away. It won’t.\n\nWhat’s more likely is that folks are hoping to avoid giving the disingenuous and damaging film any more attention. Or, they’ve seen it and they realize how tedious it would be to debunk every false claim. (Spoiler alert: They are plentiful.)\n\nWhile Walsh’s film is heralded as groundbreaking by those who already oppose transgender rights, it is effectively a supercut of disinformation about — and mockery of — transgender people.What is a Woman?makes many false claims, but none of them are new and most are easily debunked by a quick Google search.\n\nHere are some of the film’s most malignant myths.\n\nIn an effort to portray gender transition as dangerous, the film includes the assertion that transition makes people suicidal.This claim is likely rooted in a misinterpretation of the research, promoted by anti-transgender psychiatrist Dr Paul McHugh in a 2014Wall Street Journalop-ed.But the2011 Swedish studyhe references was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of gender affirmation surgeries – and its authors caution against such an interpretation.\n\nTrans journalist Cristan Williamsinterviewed lead author Dr. Cecilia Dhejne, who expressed her frustration at the ways in which her research had been misrepresented.\n\n“I’ve even seen professors use my work to support ridiculous claims. I’ve often had to respond myself by commenting on articles, speaking with journalists, and talking about this problem at conferences,” Dhenje said. “People who misuse the study always omit the fact that the study clearly states that it is not an evaluation of gender dysphoria treatment. If we look at the literature, we find that several recent studies conclude that WPATH Standards of Care compliant treatment decrease gender dysphoria and improves mental health.”\n\nSome of the worst fear-mongering comes from transgender man Scott Newgent, who is on a crusade against medical transition for youth.\n\nScott Newgent:\"We have 5 children's hospitals in the United States telling girls that they can be boys at $70K a pop, in a surgery that has a 67% complication rate.\"#WhatIsAWomanpic.twitter.com/UaUOuQTNVK\n\n..."}

Let’s hope that the wounded recover, and the Kansas City killing can continue to be classified among the merely mundane, everyday horrors that are now incorporated into the American way of life.\n\nShooting deaths in places once reserved for celebration are now as American as apple pie and Fourth-of-July parades\n\nBut that classification doesn’t do justice to this ever more frequent American phenomenon in which gunfire turns the joy of celebrants into terror.\n\nInitial reports suggest that a private dispute, and not politics or ideology, led to the gunfire in Kansas City, so it was not an act of terrorism by the common definition that makes us  think of hijacked airplanes and the 9/11 attacks. It appears to have had no political motivation of the sort that led to the2015 Christmas party massacreby homegrown Islamic extremists in San Bernardino, or the white supremacist slaughters of Black people in a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015, a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket in 2022, a Dollar General store in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2023, and countless other shootings in which people were targeted for their race, religion or politics.\n\nThis country is exactly the place for hateful, murderous, suicidal gun violence, because this is the place for millions upon millions of guns and the bizarre American delusion that the more of them we have, the safer and freer we are.\n\nIt may be more akin to incidents like the one in Orange County last year in which a man tried togun down his estranged wifeat a local bar and ended up shooting eight others, three of them fatally. Or any number of incidents in which an armed person at a party, a baby shower, a wedding or any other celebration felt entitled to settle scores with deadly violence.\n\nRegardless of the motivation, though, the result is terror, as the word is generally understood. The terrorist wields violence and fear, and undermines people’s self-confidence and sense of security. What is it, if not terror, that the ever-present threat of gun violence makes Americans think twice before gathering in public places to share our pride and pleasure in football teams, parades, music, freedom or each other?\n\nThe suspect in the mass shooting in Lewiston is said to be a military reservist with a history of mental issues. He’s no more or less typical than other U.S. mass shooters.\n\nIt makes little difference in the moment to those running for their lives whether the perpetrator was motivated by ideology, personal grievance or self-obsession. Gun violence turns places of sanctuary and celebration — schools, churches, synagogues, dance clubs, Super Bowl victory parades — into targets. People who so grievously misuse their gun rights are terrorists.\n\nIt’s a peculiarly American twist that we politicize even the perception of this kind of terror. Democrats focus on mass shootings and rail against Republicans for defending easy access to the guns that make them possible. Republicans double down on street crime and criticize Democrats for supposedly being too soft on the shooters. But all gun violence — even now, as homicide rates plummet — inflicts terror. The foreign agents and domestic white supremacists who want to destroy the United States are achieving their goal.

But if there’s one group of people that has disproportionately benefitted from the ex-beauty pageant owner’s presidency, it’s people who share his last name. If there’s another, it would be the members of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s “winter White House” where he regularly entertains heads of state. Since Trump took office in 2017—at which point the membership fee to join the private clubdoubledto $200,000—paying customers have gotten front-row seats to dinnertime North Koreastrategy sessions, selfies with the guycarrying the nuclear codes, and, in some cases, free rein to (allegedly!)secretly run a federal agency. More publicly, Trump has so far nominated four club members to represent the U.S. as ambassadors abroad, most recentlyLana Marks,who, as the White House announced late Wednesday, is the president’s pick for envoy to South Africa.\n\nWhat are Marks’s qualifications to serve as an ambassador? It may surprise you to hear that they’re a bit thin! Although the Palm Beach-based designer wasborn and raisedin South Africa and attended the University of the Witwatersrand, she has zero diplomatic experience or training. Professionally, she’s a luxury-handbag designer known for products made with exotic animal skins, such as alligator and ostrich, which can be sold for between $19,000 and $400,000 a pop; the concept, perCNN, was born when “Marks couldn’t find a bag to match the suit she planned to wear to a birthday celebration forQueen Elizabeth.” According to thePalm Beach Daily,she’s known to be “like Trump, a relentless self-promotor.” And that’snot where the similarities end!\n\nMarks must be confirmed by the Senate Foreign Relational Committee, which could take under consideration more than a dozen past lawsuits against her in Aspen, New York, California, and South Florida. In those lawsuits she has repeatedly been accused of stiffing her attorneys, accountants, landlords, and employees.\n\nIn July 2015, she was evicted from her office on Worth Avenue for failing to pay $25,399 in rent and other expenses. In 2004, 2007, and 2009, the landlords for her store on Worth Avenue also filed complaints against her for failing to pay rent, although the cases were settled without eviction.\n\nFor his part, Trump doesn’t have the greatest track record when it comes to South Africa. Last August, after watching a segment byTucker Carlsonon Fox News, hetweetedthat he’d asked Secretary of StateMike Pompeoto “closely study” the government’s “large scale” land seizures and killing of white farmers, which are, of course, not actually happening anywhere but in the minds of the white supremacists from whom our presidentapparently gets his policy ideas.

You know, if the former president had any self-knowledge or even the slightest ability to be self-deprecating, he might consider giving himself this alliterative nickname.\n\nAfter three straight national tallies in which either he or his party or both were hammered by the national electorate, it’s time for even his stans to accept the truth: Toxic Trump is the political equivalent of a can of Raid.\n\nWhat Tuesday night’s results suggest is thatTrump is perhaps the most profound vote repellentin modern American history.\n\nThe surest way to lose in these midterms was to be a politician endorsed by Trump.\n\nThis is not hyperbole.\n\nExcept for deep-red states where a Republican corpse would have beaten a Democrat, voters choosing in actually competitive races — who everyone expected would behave like midterm voters usually do and lean toward the out party — took one look at Trump’s handpicked acolytes and gagged.\n\nLiberal fundraisers actuallyput money behind Trump-endorsed candidatesin GOP primaries all over the place to help them prevail so that Democrats could face them in the general election. It was transparently cynical and an abuse of our political process. But it worked like gangbusters.\n\nAs Kevin Robillard of the Huffington Post noted on Wednesday afternoon when a Michigan Democrat named Hilary Scholten was finally declared the winner of her House seat against araving lunatic named John Gibbs: “With this race call, every single Republican who won their primary with help from Democratic meddling has lost in the general election.”\n\nGibbs is an example of Trump’s monomania. A former official for Trump’s Department of Housing and Urban Development, Gibbs tweeted that officials associated with Hillary Clinton participated in Satanic rituals. But no matter! Gibbs believed the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump, the only stance that matters to the former president.\n\nTrump backed Gibbs in the primary to unseat a sitting Republican, Peter Meijer, because Meijer had the temerity to vote in favor of impeachment after the shame of Jan. 6.Trump got his way. Republicans lost the seat.\n\nThis pattern repeated itself over and over and over again.\n\nIn almost every place a Trumpster lost, there had been a regular Republican who could and should have been the party’s nominee — a nominee who could have taken advantage of the uniquely horrible facts and fundamentals confronting Democratic candidates in 2022.\n\nBut then Toxic Trump came into these races, picking the candidate who bowed lowest — or, as in Pennsylvania, went for a snake-oil doctor salesman because, it seems, hiswife enjoyed watching Mehmet Oz carny-barkon afternoon TV.\n\nAnd the independent voters’ history tells us would ordinarily have flocked to the GOP and said, “Oh, man, what is that stink?”\n\nIn the past four midterms, indies by double-digit margins chose the party that did not hold the White House. In 2018, with Trump as president, the independent vote was 12 points in the Democrats’ favor. In 2006, with George W. Bush in the Oval Office, the number was 18 points. When Barack Obama was president in 2010 and 2014, indies went 16 and 12 points in the Republican direction, respectively.\n\nThis week,independents went 49-48 for the Democrats. One point — in the other direction.\n\nIndependents made the difference then and they made the difference on Tuesday. They didn’t want to keep hearing about voter fraud that didn’t exist, or about how the world had done wrong to a multibillionaire boo-hoo whiner who lost his re-election bid due to his own incompetence.\n\nVoters have their own problems. This election was about them, not Toxic Trump’s pathological inability to accept his own failure — and his desperate need to elevate cringe-inducing boot-lickers while punishing politicians capable of an independent thought.\n\nThe British political figure Oliver Cromwell once said about other British politicians who had overstayed their welcome and were ruining the country, “In the name of God, go!”\n\nYo, Toxic Trump: Scram.\n\nDavid McCormick, a former undersecretary of the Treasury Department under George W. Bush, was recruited to run for the Pennsylvania seat vacated by Republican Pat Toomey. But Trump favored TV personality Oz and attacked McCormick in the primary. Oz lost to John Fetterman, a Democrat who was so addled by a stroke, he could barely debate.\n\nMitch McConnell and other Republican leaders very much wanted Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to run against Democrat Mark Kelly for Senate. But Trump blasted Ducey for not illegally overturning the 2022 election results in Arizona, and the governor decided not to run. The race hasn’t been called, but it seems that Kelly will defeat election denier Masters.\n\nThe Republican candidate for senator from New Hampshire got Trump’s support for saying 2020 was stolen during the primary. But when he wavered in the general, Trump attacked him, and when Bolduc lost to Democrat Maggie Hassan,Trump dis..."}

Duncan Hunter pleaded not guilty this week to fraud and conspiracy charges, including that hespent $250,000 worth of campaign fundson personal expenses. But even if the California Republican is telling the truth, he’s still a weasel. He is shifting blame to his wife, Margaret, who was also indicted this week.\n\n“She was also the campaign manager, so whatever she did that’ll be looked at too, I’m sure,” the congressman told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum Thursday, stressing his wife handled all campaign spending. “But I didn’t do it. I didn’t spend any money illegally.”\n\nAuthorities have charged the Hunters with conspiracy, wire fraud, falsification of records related to campaign finance, and prohibited use of campaign contributions.\n\n“My campaign did make mistakes,” Hunter claimed. “There was money spent on things not by me but by the campaign, and I paid that back before my last election.”\n\nThe congressman will likely have a harder time explaining these remarks to his wife than explaining to her the nature of his relationship with the D.C. residentsidentified in the indictmentas individuals “14” and “18,” and why he spent $162.02 getting a room at the Liaison Capitol Hill hotel with the former and why he spent $32.27 taking an Uber at 7:40 a.m. from the latter’s home to his office.\n\nEven if it’s true that Hunter, a former U.S. Marine, gave his wife power of attorney in 2003 when he went to Iraq, and that she is thus responsible for his personal and campaign finances, his responses to the indictment has not been exemplary, to put it politely.\n\nOn top of heaving his wife under the bus this week, the Republican lawmaker also complained that his congressional salaryisn’t good enough.\n\nMacCallum asked, “I mean, $174,000 per year is what a member of Congress makes. Do you think they should make more than that, is it not enough to live on?”\n\nThe congressman, whose district includes San Diego, responded, “It depends where you live. It’s difficult to live in a place like San Francisco or San Diego or New York or D.C. It’s probably easier to live in Kansas or Missouri, so it’s all relative.”\n\nBut as theWashington Examiner’s Anna Giaritelli noted this week, “Hunter’s salary was more than two and a half times greater than the median household income of a California family:$64,500.”\n\nAlso, in 2016, “the average median income nationwide was$59,039.”\n\nMy heart bleeds for the congressman.\n\nFollowing news of the indictment, House leaders removed Hunter from his three committee assignments, which included spots on the House Armed Services, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Education and the Workforce Committees.\n\n—\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nNotifications"}

A book that ranks in the bottom five of Publishers Weekly rankings will on average place five spots lower on the Times’ list, the analysis concluded.\n\nMichael Knowles, a conservative commentator, is author of the 2021 book “Speechless: Controlling Words, Controlling Minds.”\n\nIn its first week, it sold 17,587 copies — good for first place on Publishers Weekly’s list. The book recorded robust sales in the weeks that followed.\n\nNonetheless, it failed to crack the Times’ bestseller list.\n\n“The New York Times has a view of an acceptable kind of conservative,” Knowles told the Economist.\n\nAri Fleischer, who was White House press secretary during the George W. Bush administration, is author of the 2022 book “Suppression, Deception, Snobbery and Bias.”\n\nThe book reached as high as No. 6 on Publishers Weekly’s list of bestselling non-fiction works in the summer of 2022.\n\nBut the book was nowhere to be found on the Times’ list.\n\n“It’s bang-your-head-against-the-wall frustrating,” Fleischer told the Economist.\n\nEarlier this year, author Rob Henderson’s book “Troubled” about the hypocrisy of America’s elite was omitted from the Times’ bestseller list despite the fact that its sales outperformed those that were ranked as high as fourth and fifth that week, according to Circana Bookscan, which tracks 85% of print book sales in the US.\n\nOthers books that sold well but which were conspicuously absent from the Times’ bestseller list include “A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America” by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and “American Playbook: A Guide to Winning Back the Country from the Democrats” by commentator Clay Travis.\n\nFor authors, the prestige that comes with being included on the Times bestseller list often translates into more sales, higher speaking fees and better deals in future contracts with publishers.\n\nBut the Times has never revealed its methodology for how it ranks bestselling books.\n\nIn March, Tesla CEO Elon Musk blasted the Times for its “pure propaganda” after Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase and former general partner of venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz, wrote on X that the bestseller list was “fake.”\n\nSrinivasan, who is also the author of “The Network State,” reacted to a decades-old lawsuit filed by “The Exorcist” author William Peter Blatty against the newspaper for allegedly ignoring his book’s robust sales figures.\n\n“They were forced to admit in court that it is not a ranked list. It’s actually ‘editorial content’ and they can exclude books they don’t like,” Srinivasan wrote.\n\nIn his post, Srinivasan provided a link to“Kill Zone,” a blogdevoted to top thriller and mystery writers, which recounted the story of Blatty’s lawsuit.\n\nA Times spokesperson told the Economist: “The political views of authors or their publishers have absolutely no bearing on our rankings and are not a factor in how books are ranked on the lists.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that “there are a number of organizations with bestseller lists, each with different methodologies, so it is normal to see different rankings on each.”\n\nThe Post has sought comment from the Times.\n\nAdvertisement"}

Is the freewheeling heyday of America’s tech giants winding down?\n\nThis is an edition ofThe AtlanticDaily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nBut first, here are three new stories fromThe Atlantic.\n\nChallenging Power, Again\n\nThe year was 1998. Bill Clinton was in office.Titanichad just won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Backstreet Boys were ascendant. And Microsoft was in court, teeing off against the Justice Department over claims that it was a monopoly. That landmark case, which ultimately resulted in a settlement, was the last time the government took a major tech company to trial for antitrust issues.\n\nThat will change next week, when theU.S. et al v. Googletrialbeginsin Washington, D.C. The Justice Department (joined by a group of states) has sued Google,claimingthat the search giant illegally protected its market position by striking exclusive deals—in particular,one with Applestarting 18 years ago that set Google as the default search engine on iPhones and other devices. This isn’t the department’s only lawsuit against the company, but it is the first to go to trial, and regardless of the outcome, this case signals that the government is serious about investigating the influence that a few companies have consolidated. And it could put pressure on tech firms to proceed more carefully.\n\nThe moment is ripe for a Big Tech trial: As tech companies have become more and more powerful, public scrutiny has increased. No longer is antitrust zealconsideredmerely a left-wing cause; Republicans and Democrats alike are now interested in bringing Big Tech down a notch. The Justice Department’s lawsuit was filed in October 2020, when Donald Trump wasstill in office; Merrick Garland’s team has since taken over the case. We are also in a time of market concentration. Huge companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google have amassed immense sway over the past 20 years. (By some measures, Google commands about90 percentof the domestic search market.) Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs and chief legal officer, said in a statement, “This is a backwards-looking case at a time of unprecedented innovation,” adding that “people don’t use Google because they have to—they use it because they want to.” The company has said that its default agreements are not exclusive. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMicrosoft’s antitrust woes in the 1990s are worth looking back on, both for their similarities to the impending Google trial and for how the internet has changed in the decades since. The Microsoft trial was a dramatic one. Videos of Bill Gates being deposed by David Boies (who would later represent clients including Theranos)reportedlycaused a judge to burst into laughter in the courtroom. Not long after the court ruled thatMicrosoft was a monopoly, in 2000, the company appealed, and the decision was partially overturned. Among the many concerns of the appeals court were reports that the same judge had been bad-mouthing Microsoftto journalists.\n\nAn antitrust lawyer named Gary Reback, who pushed the government to take action against Microsoft, became famous in Silicon Valley in the years leading up to the case. He appeared on the cover ofWiredin 1997 with the tagline “This Lawyer Is Bill Gates’s Worst Nightmare.” When I called Reback yesterday, he told me that back in the 1990s, Microsoft’s “monopoly was more far reaching and profound than any one single monopolist today.” (Reback has been involved with litigation against Googlein recent years.)\n\nMicrosoft’s power was indeed massive, and could have grown further. “Imagine a world in which Microsoft had been allowed to monopolize the browser business,” the law professor and former Biden adviser Tim Wu and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthalwrotein 2018. “Holding a triple monopoly (operating system, major applications and the browser), Microsoft would have controlled the future of the web.” And to some, regulation of the company portended a larger change: Milton Friedmanpredicted, in 1999, “From now on the computer industry, which has been very fortunate in that it has been relatively free of government intrusion, will experience a continuous increase in government regulation.”\n\nFriedman’s prediction didn’t exactly come true in recent decades—but it still could. However the Google trial plays out, it could well lead these companies toward more caution, as the 1998 trial seemed to do for Microsoft. Lee Hepner, the legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties project, an anti-monopoly nonprofit, told me that the Google trial will be key for understanding whether antitrust laws are equipped to handle monopoly power in today’s environment.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nNewcoronaviruscases across the United States have tumbled to rates not seen in more than 11 months, sparking optimism that vaccination campaigns are stemming both severe COVID-19 cases and the spread of the virus.\n\nAs cases, hospitalizations and deaths steadily dropped this week, pre-pandemic life in America has largely resumed. Hugs and unmasked crowds returned to theWhite House, aMardi Gras-style parademarched through Alabama's port city of Mobile, and even states that have stuck to pandemic-related restrictions readied to drop them. However, health experts also cautioned that not enough Americans have been vaccinated to completely extinguish the virus, leaving the potential for new variants that could extend the pandemic.\n\nAs the seven-day average for new cases dropped below 30,000 per day this week, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pointed out cases have not been this low since June 18, 2020. The average number of deaths over the last seven days also dropped to 552 — a rate not seen since July last year. It's a dramatic drop since the pandemic hit a devastating crescendo in January.\n\n\"As each week passes and as we continue to see progress, these data give me hope,\" Walensky said Friday at a news conference.\n\nHealth experts credit an efficient rollout of vaccines for the turnaround. More than 60% of people over 18 have received at least one shot, and almost half are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Butdemand for vaccineshas dropped across much of the country. President Joe Biden's administration is trying to convince other Americans to sign up for shots, using an upbeat message that vaccines offer a return to normal life.\n\nBLOOMBERG COLUMNIST DECLARES DESANTIS ‘PANDEMIC WINNER’\n\nWhite House health officials on Friday even waded into offering dating advice.They are teaming up with dating appsto offer a new reason to \"swipe right\" by featuring vaccination badges on profiles and in-app bonuses for people who have gotten their shots.\n\nOhio, New York, Oregon and other states are enticing people to get vaccinated through lottery prizes of up to $5 million.\n\nAcross the country, venues and events reopened after shuttering for much of the last year.\n\nOn Saturday, Karen Stetz readied to welcome what she hoped would be a good crowd to the Grosse Pointe Art Fair on Michigan’s Lake St. Clair.\n\nWith natural ventilation from the lake and mask and capacity restrictions easing, Stetz was optimistic that artists who make their living traveling a show circuit that ground to a halt last year would begin to bounce back. The event usually draws from 5,000 to 10,000 people.\n\n\"I feel like most people are ready to get out,\" Stetz said by phone shortly before opening the fair. \"It seems like people are eager, but it’s hard to know still. I’m sure there’s a percentage of people that are going to wait until they’re comfortable.\"\n\nIn Mobile, thousands of joyful revelers, many without masks, competed for plastic beads and trinkets tossed from floats Friday night as Alabama’s port city threw a Mardi Gras-style parade. But only about a quarter of the county's population is fully vaccinated. Many went without masks, though health officials had urged personal responsibility.\n\nAlabama's vaccination rate — 34% of people have received at least one dose — is one of the lowest in the country. It's part of a swath of Southern states where vaccine uptake has been slow. Health experts worry that areas with low vaccination rates could give rise to new virus variants that are more resistant to vaccinations.\n\n\"My biggest concern is new strains of the virus and the need to remain vigilant in the months ahead,\" said Boston College public health expert Dr. Philip J. Landrigan.\n\nUS, CANADA, MEXICO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS EXTENDED\n\nA medical center in Louisiana reported Friday it has identified the state’s first two cases of a COVID-19 variant that has spread widely since being identified in India. TheCOVID-19 varianthas been classified as a \"variant of concern\" by Britain and the World Health Organization, meaning there is some evidence that it spreads more easily between people, causes more severe disease, or might be less responsive to treatments and vaccines. The variant has also been reported in several other states, including Tennessee, Nebraska and Nevada.\n\nThough Landrigan said the big drop in cases nationwide was \"the best news we've had on the pandemic\" and showed that vaccines are working, he warned that people should remain vigilant for local flare-ups of new cases.\n\nM..."}

Puskar, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — America’s employers added a substantial 311,000 jobs in February, fewer thanJanuary’s huge gainbut enough to keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively to fight inflation.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, from a 53-year low of 3.4%, as more Americans began searching for work but not all of them found jobs.\n\nFriday’s report from the government made clear that the nation’s job market remains fundamentally healthy, with many employers still eager to hire. Fed Chair Jerome Powelltold Congress this weekthat the Fed would likely ratchet up its rate hikes if signs continued to point to a robust economy and persistently high inflation. A strong job market typically leads businesses to raise pay and then pass their higher labor costs on to customers through higher prices.\n\nFebruary’s sizable job growth shows that so far, hiring is continuing to strengthen this year after having eased in late 2022. From October through December, the average monthly job gain was 284,000. That average has surged to 351,000 for the past three months.\n\nEconomists pointed to other data in Friday’s report that suggested that the job market, while still hot, may be better balancing employers’ need for workers and the supply of unemployed people. More people have been coming off the sidelines to seek work, a trend that makes it easier for businesses to fillthe millions of jobs that remain open.\n\nThe proportion of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one has risen for three straight months to 62.5%, the highest level since COVID struck three years ago. Still, it remains below its pre-pandemic level of 63.3%.\n\nWith more potential hires to choose from, employers seem under less pressure now to dangle higher pay to attract or retain workers. Average wage growth slowed in February, rising just 0.2%, to $33.09, the smallest monthly increase in a year. Measured year over year, though, hourly pay is up 4.6%, well above the pre-pandemic trend. Even so, that’s down from average annual gains above 5% last year.\n\nWhat the Fed may decide to do about interest rates when it meets later this month remains uncertain. The Fed’s decision will rest, in part, on its assessment of Friday’s jobs data and next week’s report on consumer inflation in February. Last month, the government’s report on January inflation had raised alarms by showing that consumer prices had reaccelerated on a month-to-month basis.\n\nAhead of the February jobs data, many economists had said they thought the Fed would announce a substantial half-point increase in its key short-term interest rate, rather than a quarter point hike as it did at its meeting in February. Friday’s more moderate hiring and wage figures, though, led some analysts to suggest that the central bank may not need to move so aggressively at this month’s meeting.\n\n“There’s clear signs of cooling when you dig deeper into the numbers,” said Mike Skordeles, head of economics at Truist, a bank. “I think it makes the case for the Fed to say ... we’ll still hike rates, but we’re not going to do” a half-point hike.\n\nThe Fed’s final determination, though, will rest heavily on Tuesday’s report on consumer prices.\n\n“Everything now hinges on February’s CPI report,” said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.\n\nWhen the Fed tightens credit, it typically leads to higher rates on..."}

The short version is that a professor named Erika López Prater showed students in her global-art-history class a 14th-century painting depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Aware that many Muslims regard such images as sacrilege, she warned ahead of time that she was going to show the picture and offered to excuse any student who did not want to view it.\n\nProfessor López Prater’s contract has not been renewed, and she will not be returning to the classroom. The university strenuously denies that she was fired. Of course, colleges let adjuncts go all the time, often reluctantly. But this, to me, seems like something more.\n\nI began my 35-year teaching career in the late 1980s and was once a tenure-track faculty member at an elite college, where I was one of a handful of registered Republicans among a mostly liberal faculty. I have been denied tenure at one school and granted it at two others. I have been an adjunct, contract faculty (that is, working on a long-term contract but without actual tenure), a department chair, and a tenured full professor. I have led a tenure committee, and I have written tenure and promotion letters for candidates at other schools at the request of their institution. I have been a faculty member in a U.S. government institution, where I had to balance my right to self-expression against important and necessary legal restrictions on politicking in the classroom.\n\nSo I think I have a pretty clear idea of what goes on in classrooms. I know what academic freedom means. I think I know what “fired” looks like, and it seems to me that López Prater was fired—a conclusion that seems especially likely in the wake of a highly defensive public letter the school’s president, Fayneese Miller, wrote about the whole business.\n\nAfter a piece about the controversy appearedinThe New York Times, Miller issueda statementin which she decried how Hamline is now “under attack from forces outside our campus.”\n\nVarious so-called stakeholders interpreted the incident, as reported in various media, as one of “academic freedom.” The Timeswent so far as to cite PEN America’s claim that what was happening on our campus was one of the “most egregious violations of academic freedom” it had ever encountered.\n\nIt begs the question, “How?”\n\nAllow me to interpret. By “so-called stakeholders,” Miller, I think, means people who believe this issue affects them, but who should buzz off and mind their own business. (And while I’m at it,stakeholdersis a bit of jargon that should be banned from education.) About López Prater, Miller said, “The decision not to offer her another class was made at the unit level”—I assume here she means the department in which López Prater worked—”and in no way reflects on her ability to adequately teach the class.” Oh? Then what prompted “the decision at the unit level”?\n\nMiller then lists the impeccably liberal credentials of Hamline as a school, none of which have anything to do with this case. After all of this throat clearing, she gets to the real questions she thinks should have been raised about academic freedom.\n\nFirst, does your defense of academic freedom infringe upon the rights of students in violation of the very principles you defend? Second, does the claim that academic freedom is sacrosanct, and owes no debt to the traditions, beliefs, and views of students, comprise a privileged reaction?\n\nThis makes no sense. The “rights” of students were not jeopardized, and no curriculum owes a “debt” to any student’s “traditions, beliefs, and views.” (Indeed, if you don’t want your traditions, beliefs, or views challenged, then don’t come to a university, at least not to study anything in the humanities or the social sciences.) Miller’s view, it seems, is thatacademic freedomreally only meansas much freedom as your most sensitive students can stand, an irresponsible position that puts the university, the classroom, and the careers of scholars in the hands of students who are inexperienced in the subject matter, new to academic life, and, often, still in the throes of adolescence.\n\nThis, asI have writtenelsewhere, is contrary to the very notion of teaching itself. (It is also not anything close to thebedrock 1940 statementon the matter from the American Association of University Professors.) The goal of the university is to create educa..."}

The commission will perform “a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government,” he told the crowd.\n\nThe commission will also make recommendations for “drastic reforms,” including ways to reduce fraud in the federal government and improper payments, he said. Trump claimed his plan will “save trillions of dollars,” calling the savings “massive.”\n\nNews about the commission follows a conversation that Trump had with Musk on X. The SpaceX founder pushed the former president to organize such a task force and volunteered to help with the endeavor.\n\nMusk praised the move in a post on X after the news about Trump’s plans for the commission broke.\n\n“I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises,” he said. “No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.”\n\nThe head of the largest union for federal employees immediately blasted the plan. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said such a move would actually lead to higher levels of government waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n“Billionaires like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and the folks behind Project 2025 want to get rid of the apolitical civil service, fire hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants, and replace them with a corrupt spoils system where government workers are hired and fired based on their loyalty to Donald Trump, not on their ability to do the job or fulfill their oath to uphold the law and the constitution,” Kelley said in a statement.\n\nThe proposed commission is just the latest foray into the Republican fight against regulations and the administrative state. Republicans have lambasted President Joe Biden for the raft of rulemaking and use of federal agencies.\n\nThey contend that Biden has used rulemaking to shape policy while circumventing congressional authority.\n\nTrump has long railed against the regulatory state. In 2016, he campaigned on the idea that the administration should eliminate two existing regulations for every new one. On Thursday, he called for that ratio to be upped to that to 10 to 1.\n\nTrump also said he would propose lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% for companies that manufacture their products in the United States.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have also targeted the administrative state.\n\nEarlier this year, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) introduced a bill, dubbed the Sunset Act, that would require all major rules to expire 10 years after they are enacted unless approved by both chambers of Congress under a joint resolution.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRep.

They’ve been violating it for many years,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One to leave Nevada following a campaign rally.\n\nRelated articleTrump casts Democrats as 'angry, ruthless, unhinged mob' in Nevada ahead of midterm elections\n\n“And I don’t know why President Obama didn’t negotiate or pull out. And we’re not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement and go out and do weapons and we’re not allowed to,” he said. “We’re the ones that have stayed in the agreement and we’ve honored the agreement.\n\n“But Russia has not, unfortunately, honored the agreement. So we’re going to terminate the agreement. We’re gonna pull out,” he said of the agreement, which was signed in December 1987 by former President Ronald Reagan and former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Russia’s state-run news agency, RIA Novosti, reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to discuss the decision with US national security adviser John Bolton when he visits Russia this week.\n\nAccording to the report, the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said, “It’s likely that an explanation from the US will be required following the latest scandalous statements.”\n\nThe treaty forced both countries to eliminate ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between approximately 300 and 3,400 miles. It offered a blanket of protection to the United States’ European allies and marked a watershed agreement between two nations at the center of the arms race during the Cold War.\n\nFormer State Department spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby, a CNN military and diplomatic analyst, explained that the treaty “wasn’t designed to solve all of our problems with the Soviet Union,” but was “designed to provide a measure of some strategic stability on the continent of Europe.”\n\n“I suspect our European allies right now are none too happy about hearing that President Trump intends to pull out of it,” he said.\n\nThe Trump Administrationhas said repeatedlythat Russia has violated the treaty and has pointed to their predecessors in the Obama administration who accused Russia of violating the terms of the agreement.\n\nIn 2014, CNN reportedthat the US had accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty, citing cruise missile tests that dated to 2008. CNN reported in 2014 that the United States at the time informed its NATO allies of Russia’s suspected breach.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until recently that NATO officially confirmed Russia’s activity constituted a likely violation.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier this month that the military alliance remained “concerned about Russia’s lack of respect for its international commitments, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the INF Treaty.”\n\nRelated articleUS threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles if Moscow keeps violating nuclear treaty\n\n“This treaty abolishes a whole category of weapons and is a crucial element of our security,” Stoltenberg said, speaking at a defense ministers’ meeting. “Now this treaty is in danger because of Russia’s actions.”\n\nHe continued, “After years of denials, Russia recently acknowledged the existence of a new missile system, called 9M729. Russia has not provided any credible answers on this new missile. All allies agree that the most plausible assessment would be that Russia is in violation of the treaty. It is therefore urgent that Russia addresses these concerns in a substantial and transparent manner.”\n\nMoscow’s failure to adhere to the agreement was also addressedin the most recent Nuclear Posture Reviewpublished by the Defense Department in February, which said Russia “continues to violate a series of arms control treaties and commitments.”\n\n“In a broader context, Russia is either rejecting or avoiding its obligations and commitments under numerous agreements and has rebuffed U.S. efforts to follow the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) with another round of negotiated reductions and to pursue reductions in non-strategic nuclear forces.”\n\nPulling out of the treaty could provoke a similar arms race across Europe akin to the one that was occurring when the agreement was initially signed in the 1980s.\n\n“I don’t think we’re at the stage right now that if we pull out of the INF Treaty, you’ve got to go sort of build a bunker in your backyard,” Kirby said.\n\n“I don’t think we’re at that stage at all,” he said. “But I do think, if we pull out, we really do need to think about how we are going to, right now because we don’t have the same capability as the Russians have with this particular missile.

Jeff Flake vowed not to vote for any more of President Trump's judicial nominees until the Senate votes to protect Mueller, putting pressure on McConnell to change his mind.\n\nBuzzFeed News Reporter\n\nReporting From\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nWASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Jeff Flake says he will block all of President Trump’s judicial nominees until his bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller goes to a vote.\n\nFlake’s move comes after Trumpforced Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resignand appointed Matt Whitaker, a Trump loyalist who hasrepeatedly criticized Mueller’s investigation, as acting attorney general. Trump had repeatedly railed against Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nFlake has long been a critic of Trump but has mostly declined to use his leverage in the razor-thin Senate to hold up Republican judges. That changed Wednesday when Flake sought unanimous consent to bring his bill to protect Mueller forward for debate. Majority LeaderMitch McConnellrefused, blocking the bill.\n\nFlake then declared he will vote to reject all judicial nominees. “This is not a moment for our national leadership to be weak or irresolute,” he said on the Senate floor.\n\nFlake is the swing vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee and, with Democrats, can vote down judicial nominations. McConnell could still bring these nominations forward to the Senate floor against the will of the committee, but Flake said he doubts this would happen because it would alienate GOP senators.\n\n“I’d be surprised, because there’s such a slim margin on the floor. Some members are sticklers for precedent and you don’t want to get in the habit of basically nullifying a committee’s actions,” said Flake.\n\nMcConnell has made confirming conservative judges to lifetime appointments one of his top priorities under the Trump administration. Dozens of nominations hang in the balance. If he were to bypass the Judicial Committee, Flake would need the help of just one more Republican senator to kill nominations. Flake said he is in talks with other Republicans to team up with him, but did not identify who.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee passed the Mueller protection bill months ago, but Mitch McConnell repeatedly refused to bring it forward for a vote. He argued the bill is unnecessary because there is no sign that Trump will fire Mueller. Flake argues that is no longer true.\n\n“The justification given in April for not bringing it to the floor for a vote was that nobody was being fired, nothing to see here, special counsel Mueller was not in any danger. That clearly is not the case now,” said Flake Wednesday.\n\nTheSpecial Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, cosponsored by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, would require that the special counsel could only be fired for good cause, and would allow for the courts to overturn the firing if good cause could not be proved.\n\nCoons said he is certain the bill has the needed support of 60 senators to pass the Senate. But it has always faced very long odds of becoming law, given that it would require Trump signing on to a measure that limits his own powers.\n\nTechnically Trump cannot fire Mueller on his own. Under current Justice Department regulations, only the attorney general can fire Mueller.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the department’s number two official, had overseen the Mueller investigation since Sessions recused himself last year. Whitaker’s appointment as acting attorney general puts him in charge of the probe, but Democrats have called on him to recuse himself as well.\n\nBuzzFeed News Reporter"}

He had just announced as much to a crowd in Ohio. The assembled military and national security advisers told him the move was rash and unwise. So he gave them six months.\n\nEight months later,planning for the withdrawal is now underway– against the advice of those same officials, who warned in April that Russia and Iran would gain stronger footholds in Syria when the US presence there evaporates.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, even some of Trump’s GOP allies were warning of a grave mistake.\n\n“My sense is that it’s been a shock through the administration that this was made,” Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Wednesday after returning from the White House, where he had traveled to meet with Trump but was told as he waited the meeting was canceled.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication, with this little preparation,” Corker said. “I mean, my understanding is that we’re beginning to move out right now.”\n\nHurried discussions continued Wednesday about the timing and pace of the troop withdrawal, which the White House said has already begun. The announcement lacked the formality of previous presidents’ declarations they would remove troops from war zones: the White House did not schedule any presidential remarks nor provide any concrete details of the decision.\n\nTrump issued his first public comments on the decision Wednesday evening in a video message posted to Twitter, in which he pointed to the sky to reference US military personnel who have been killed in Syria.\n\n“We have won againstISIS,” Trump said. “We’ve beaten them and we’ve beaten them badly. We’ve taken back the land and now it’s time for our troops to come back home. I get very saddened when I have to write letters or call parents or wives or husbands of soldiers who have been killed fighting for our country.”\n\nHe added later, “So our boys, our young women, our men, they’re all coming back and they’re coming back now. We won, and that’s the way we want it.” Trump then pointed to the sky and said, “And that’s the way they want it.”\n\nAfter historic victories against ISIS, it’s time to bring our great young people home!pic.twitter.com/xoNjFzQFTp\n\nIn conversations over the past several days, top presidential advisers have counseled Trump that withdrawing personnel from Syria would amount to a retreat from the region and allow adversarial nations to gain influence. Those cautioning against a rapid and immediate withdrawal included Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nResistance to the move was strong among some in the administration. A senior administration official told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the President’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria is “a mistake of colossal proportions and the President fails to see how it will endanger our country.”\n\n“Senior officials across the administration agree that the President’s decision-by-tweet will recklessly put American and allied lives in danger around the world, take the pressure off of ISIS – allowing them to reconstitute – and hand a strategic victory to our Syrian, Iranian and Russian adversaries,” the official said.\n\nDiplomatic sources from two countries in the region said their countries were not consulted or informed, and described the news of the planned withdrawal as a “total surprise.”\n\nThe US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement Thursday that the decision will provide room for the “revival of terrorism” and will create a “political and military vacuum.”\n\nTrump did alert one key ally two days ahead of the announcement: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a phone call with Trump on Monday, and a subsequent conversation with Pompeo on Tuesday, the US leaders assured him the Americans had “other ways of expressing their influence in the area,” according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.\n\nIn a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, lawmakers gave Vice President Mike Pence an “earful” about the decision, according to Corker.\n\nSpeaking afterward, Corker said he felt badly for the vice president, who was acting as an emissary to angry lawmakers.\n\n“He had talking points,” Corker said. “There’s no way he could really defend. He did what a loyal soldier would do.”\n\nTrump’s top ally in the Senate, Sen. Lindsay Graham, was firmer.\n\n“I want you to tell the President directly that this is a huge mistake,” he said he told Pence. “You are putting in motion ISIS getting a foothold again. They are not defeated.”\n\nPence addressed the issue by saying Trump “made a commitment to get out of foreign entanglements,” Graham said.

Republicans will hold a narrow majority in the House for the first time since 2019, while Democrats retained control of the Senate in the midterm elections.\n\nSpeaking after the vote, Jeffries said his mandate is to \"advance the ball for everyday Americans and get stuff done.\"\n\n\"That's what Democrats do. That's what our record says. Each and every day, House Democrats, committed to fighting hard for working families, middle class folks, those who aspire to be part of the middle class,\" Jeffries said. \"Young people, seniors, immigrants, veterans. The poor, the sick, the afflicted, the least, the lost and the left behind. House Democrats fight for the people.\"\n\nJeffries, whose district encompasses large parts of his native Brooklyn, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and steadily ascended the party ranks, ultimately becoming chairman of the Democratic caucus in 2019. He served in the New York State Assembly prior to his election, and was a corporate lawyer before launching his political career, with stints as in-house counsel at Viacom and CBS.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Jeffries' election a \"turning point in the history of the United States Congress.\"\n\n\"It's not surprising that House Democrats are turning to someone from Brooklyn to lead the way next year, because when you're from Brooklyn, you learn quickly traits like persistence and serious mettle. It's a crowded place and a diverse place. You learn how to work with all kinds of different people. You learn how to stand your ground. You learn to not take things personally,\" Schumer, a fellow Brooklynite, said on the Senate floor. \"Hakeem Jeffries exemplifies all these traits.\"\n\nServing alongside Jeffries will be Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, who was elected Democratic whip, and Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, who was selected as caucus chairman. All three ran unopposed.\n\nLike Pelosi, current Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland declined to seek another leadership post. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the current whip, won a vote to become assistant Democratic leader in an election on Thursday. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island briefly challenged Clyburn for the post,citinga need for LGBTQ representation in leadership. He dropped his bid Thursday morning.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Rep. Ted Lieu of California won a four-way race for vice chair of the Democratic caucus, defeating Reps. Debbie Dingell, Joyce Beatty and Madeleine Dean in a vote that took three ballots. He ultimately overcame Dingell by a vote of 141 to 74 on the final ballot, becoming the highest-ranking Asian American lawmaker in Congress.\n\nPelosi congratulated the new leaders on their elevation, saying in a statement that she looks forward to an \"orderly transition\" before the next Congress.\n\n\"Together, this new generation of leaders reflects the vibrancy and diversity of our great nation — and they will reinvigorate our Caucus with their new energy, ideas and perspective,\" the California Democrat said. \"Now, with the fullest confidence of our Members, our new Leaders are well-prepared to carry on Democrats' fight for working families and defense of Democracy.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Jeffries said the new leadership team recognized the \"solemn responsibility that we are all inheriting, and the best thing that we can do as a result of the seriousness and solemnity of the moment, is lean in hard and do the best damn job that we can for the people.\"\n\n\"We are a coalition of people with different life experiences, ideologies and backgrounds. But at the end of the day, we're always committed to finding the highest common denominator in order to get big things done. For everyday Americans. I'm confident that we can continue to do it,\" he said.\n\nJeffries also offered some insight on his relationship with GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, the Republican nominee for the speakership.\n\n\"I think I've been pretty gentle on Kevin McCarthy over the years, to tell you the truth. I just respond to things that he has either said or done that I found to be outrageous, such as calling out members on our side of the aisle as extreme when he's got an extraordinary group of members on the other side ..."}

I always answer his call, based upon my life's experience.\"\n\n\"You understand my relationship with my family,\" he said. \"When my dad was 29 years old, he woke up one day, went to work, and got a phone call and lost his wife and his daughter. And, in that same accident, he also lost almost my brother and myself. And then, when I was 46 years old, my 47-year-old brother died.\"\n\n\"And in our family, when you have a call from -- I call him or he calls me or I call one of my -- his grandkids or one of my children, you always pick up the phone. It's something that we always do,\" he said.\n\nOther topics that Hunter Biden addressed included:\n\nWhen asked about a 2017 email from one of his business associates proposing that Joe Biden accept a share of profits from a prospective deal with a Chinese energy firm -- the infamous \"10 held by H for the big guy\" email -- Hunter Biden said the person who sent it, James Gilliar, had no basis for the suggestion.\n\n\"I truly don't know what the hell that James was talking about,\" Hunter Biden said.\n\nAsked about a college recommendation letter his father penned for the son of his Chinese business associate, Jonathan Li, Hunter Biden acknowledged that it happened -- but explained that \"there was a rule in my family.\"\n\n\"My dad was often asked to write recommendations for hundreds of people that -- I'm sure over the course of the last 50 years,\" he said. \"But the rule was that, if you were going to ask, that they had to be close friends; you had to know them well.\"\n\n\"And I knew both Jonathan, and I knew his son, who was applying to universities here in the United States,\" Hunter Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden at one point brought up former President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, regarding Kushner's own foreign business dealings in an attempt to draw a contrast with the scrutiny he's received from the committee.\n\n\"Unlike Jared Kushner, I've never received money from a foreign government,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden also reiterated that none of his money went to his father. He said he only sent money to his uncle James Biden and Hallie Biden -- but not his dad.\n\n\"But it's all my money, and it's none to my dad,\" he said. \"But I am telling you this: is that if you can show me where any money that I've ever had went to my father, other than, for instance, the repayment of the $1,300 for a loan for a truck -- OK?\" he said.\n\nAsked about a 2014 trip he took on Air Force Two to Beijing -- during which he reportedly introduced his father to Li -- Hunter Biden claimed it was not a meeting, but a rope-line event.\n\n\"When we returned from an event to the hotel, there was a rope line, and Jonathan Li was in the lobby of the hotel where I was going to meet him for coffee. In that line I introduced my dad to Jonathan Li and a friend of his, and they shook hands and I believe probably took a photograph,\" Hunter Biden said.\n\n\"And then my father went up to his room, and I went to have coffee with Jonathan Li,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, during the early stages of Hunter Biden's closed-door interview, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz made an appearance before the press and said it is \"a mirage to believe\" the younger Biden was engaged in legitimate business overseas.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday following the release of the transcript, ..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Congress Biden Move Seize And Sell Assets Russian Oligarchs", "output": "President Biden is asking Congress for $33bn (£27bn) in military, economic and humanitarian assistance to support Ukraine - although he insisted that the US was not \"attacking Russia\".\n\nMr Biden said it was \"critical\" for US lawmakers to approve the deal, which he said would help Ukraine defend itself.\n\nThe proposal includes more than $20bn in military aid, $8.5bn in economic aid and $3bn in humanitarian aid.\n\n\"It's not cheap,\" Mr Biden said on Thursday.\n\n\"But caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen.\"\n\nAlthough the US has already announced help for Ukraine, the proposals are a significant ramping up of aid.\n\nPresident Biden said US military support to Ukraine has so far amounted to 10 anti-tank weapons for every tank that Russia has deployed to Ukraine.\n\nBut despite his strong rhetoric, he said the US was not attacking Russia. \"We are helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,\" he insisted.\n\nOn Thursday, a spokesperson for Russia's Foreign Ministry said Western military support for Ukraine threatens \"the security of the continent\".\n\nPresident Biden is asking Congress to authorise an enormous sum of money for Ukraine - more than twice as much as the US has already spent on providing military equipment and humanitarian aid.\n\nThe US president wants to show he is undeterred by vague threats about the possible use of nuclear weapons, and a warning from Vladimir Putin that there could be retaliatory strikes against countries that intervene in Ukraine.\n\nHe shrugged off those comments - saying they show the desperation Russia is feeling about their abject failure to do what they set out to do.\n\nExplaining to Americans why this money is needed - at a time when many are suffering from rising living costs - he said it was not cheap, but doing nothing was more costly.\n\nAn additional plan to allow US authorities to not just freeze but liquidate the assets of Russian oligarchs is bold - and it has raised concerns among civil liberties groups in America. But it is likely to gain bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nYet it will not begin to cover cost of the additional sums of money the White House wants to spend supporting Ukraine's war efforts.\n\nIn his speech on Thursday, Mr Biden also addressed concerns over a nuclear confrontation. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned of a \"serious\" risk of nuclear war over Ukraine which \"can't be underestimated\".\n\n\"No one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nAdditionally, Mr Biden took aim at what he termed Russian \"gas blackmail\" to threaten European energy supplies. This week,Russia cut off gas suppliesto Poland and Bulgaria.\n\n\"We will not let Russia intimidate or blackmail their way out of these sanctions,\" he said. \"We will not allow them to use their oil and gas to avoid consequences for their aggression.\"\n\nThe announcement of the new Ukraine package comes at a difficult time for the US economy.\n\nData releasedby the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday shows that the US economy shrank in the first quarter of 2022, with gross domestic product declining 1.4% between January and March.\n\nBut the package is likely to be approved by lawmakers, said BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.\n\n\"At a time when Biden is struggling to get congressional funding for his domestic priorities, Congress seems to have an unlimited willingness to bankroll military support for Ukraine,\" he said.\n\n\"Thirty-three billion is a significant amount, but if the past is any guide it should be approved with relative ease - as long as Democrats don't try to attach unrelated spending provisions to the legislation.\"\n\nMr Biden's first funding request after the war began, which was approved by Congress last month, was less than $14bn.\n\nLast week, President Biden authorised a second $800m (£642m) military aid package in as many weeks, as well as $500m (£401m) in direct economic assistance.\n\nThe US has moved quickly to help Ukraine since the war began in late February. That includes:\n\nThe White House on Thursday also proposed making it easier for the US to seize and sell Russian oligarchs' assets, and transfer their proceeds to Ukraine.\n\nWestern allies, including European Union member states, have been working together since March to track down the assets of Russian elites, from artwork and real estate to helicopters and yachts.\n\nAccording to the White House, the US has now sanctioned and blocked vessels and aircraft worth over $1bn, while the EU has collectively frozen over $30bn.\n\nThursday's sanctions would allow the US to use the funds from confiscated assets \"to remediate harms of Russian aggression in Ukraine\".\n\nThe package will \"establish new authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy, allow the government to use the proceeds to support Ukraine and further strengthen related law enforcement tools,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nCanada's government also p..."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a right perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Examining Chinas Role Russia Ukraine Conflict", "output": "Who needs enemies when you have friends like Vladimir Putin?\n\nThis is what Xi Jinping must be thinking just six weeks after the two announced a “no limits” friendship to make the world safe for autocracies by taking on America and the other democracies, weakening Washington’s alliances in Europe and Asia and overturning the primacy of liberal democratic norms in place since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s.\n\nIn recent days, theRussian president requested military assistance from his Chinese counterpartto fight a war when much of the world is uniting against him. The cascading sanctions could soon begin to affect Chinese companies doing business with Russian entities.\n\nIf Xi makes good on hisearlier promises to support Putin, China will find itself joining the club of pariah nations that includes Russia, North Korea, Syria and Iran. If Xi turns his back on Putin in this time of need, his word can no longer be believed while his country will not regain the trust of the West. In short, Xi has seriously miscalculated.\n\nWhere does China go from here?\n\nUnder Xi, Beijing cannot reverse course. He is a genuine ideologue in the mold of Mao Zedong who sees the Chinese Communist Party as being in permanent conflict with liberal democracies. Xi Jinping Thought, officially included in the party’s constitution in 2018, promises a “tireless struggle” against alternative systems.\n\nXi has made clear that hisintention is to take Taiwan, replace American pre-eminence in Asia and establish China as the uncontested leader in the Indo-Pacific before emerging as the leading global power. As with Russia, the Chinese plan is to demand a formal sphere of influence over its neighbors, which means shaping and even vetoing their domestic and foreign-policy decisions.\n\nHaving put more than 1.5 million party officials, including many of his rivals, in jail under a so-called anti-corruption drive, his political and possibly personal survival depends on him producing what he is promising. Bear in mind that the National People’s Congress just removed the two-term limit on the presidency, which effectively opens the way for Xi to remain leader for life — provided he can deliver. That doesn’t leave much room for compromise or genuine cooperation with America or the West.\n\nXi, moreover, cannot tolerate anembarrassing Russian retreat. That would only energize the West by showing that it is possible to stand up to dictators and prevail. The Taiwanese people would take heart, as would those in other Asian states. If that occurred, Xi’s plans to gradually impose a Sino-centric order in the Indo-Pacific will meet even more resistance.\n\nThis meansXi will try to offer just enough economic and military assistanceto prevent Russian humiliation, but seek to do so quietly and even surreptitiously. This means walking back his “no limits” friendship in appearance but not substance.\n\nChina is playing a longer game and still needs capital, technology, know-how and access to Western markets to eventually surpass the United States. For this reason, Xi will try to convince the world he is vastly different from Putin even if both loathe democracy, seek the end of America’s alliances and resort to coercion to rewrite borders and rules in their favor.\n\nIf America can’t change who is in power in Moscow and Beijing, it can prepare better for what is to come. In an observation attributed to Vladimir Lenin, there are decades where nothing happens; and then there are weeks where decades happen. Putin’s violence has brought us to that time when developments that might have taken decades are playing out in a matter of weeks.\n\nRussia is a declining power and China a still-rising one. This explains Putin’s rashness and impatience on the one hand and Xi’s caution and uncharacteristic indecisiveness regarding how to respond to the Ukraine crisis on the other.\n\nRegardless, current events should invigorate democracy’s sense of fight and mission. China will come with force and in numbers if it ever thinks it can succeed — whether it be in Taiwan or another disputed territory. What we do now and then after the Ukraine crisis will determine whether the democracies are truly in decline as Xi believes or if it is the latter who must rethink his mission and China’s place in history.\n\nJohn Lee is a non-resident senior fellow at Hudson Institute.

It’s no understatement to say that the course of the pandemic depends on the leadership of the G20 countries,” the director general noted.\n\nHe added that “High-income countries have now administered almost 100 doses for every 100 people. Meanwhile, low-income countries have only been able to administer 1.5 doses for every 100 people, due to lack of supply.”\n\nHe also called on “everyone with influence — Olympic athletes, investors, business leaders, faith leaders, and every individual in their own family and community” to get behind the call for a moratorium.\n\nExperts and officials have said that COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are not yet needed. In July, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a jointstatementon the topic of booster shots.\n\nThey said:\n\nAmericans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time. FDA, CDC, and NIH are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary. This process takes into account laboratory data, clinical trial data, and cohort data – which can include data from specific pharmaceutical companies, but does not rely on those data exclusively. We continue to review any new data as it becomes available and will keep the public informed. We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Joe Bidensaidthat the United States had delivered 110 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to 65 countries.\n\nAsreportedby NPR, there were some issues with the administration’s vaccine distribution effort. “Biden first announced that the U.S. would distribute 80 million doses to countries in need by the end of June,only later to say the goalhad simply been to ‘allocate’ them by the end of June.”\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a progressive senator, said he wants to look at the details of Manchin’s proposal but did not seem surprised at the number, telling Forbes it is not “out of step with where many of us assumed he would be.”\n\n“Joe Manchin has never been shy about letting us know he wasn’t going to be comfortable with anything close to $3.5 trillion,” Murphy said, noting the announcement comes just ahead of the planned infrastructure vote: “It’s not beyond Joe Manchin to occasionally be strategic.”\n\nManchin did not offer a concrete timeline for when he would like to strike a deal with the White House and progressives but said “it’s going to take some time.”\n\nManchin and Sinema, the two holdouts on $3.5 trillion in spending, have outsized power to control Democrats’ agenda in a Senate divided evenly along party lines. Unlike most legislation, the reconciliation can pass with 51 votes rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The reconciliation package focuses on social programs like Medicare and the Child Tax Credit, while the bipartisan bill is centered on “core” infrastructure like roads, bridges and public transit."}

He also said the U.S.would becutting off \"all aid\" to three Central American countries -- Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- that he said are the source of immigrant caravans coming to the U.S.\n\n\"We build a wall or we close the southern border,\" he said ina seriesofFriday morningtweets.\n\nWe will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!\n\n....The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a “profit making operation.” We build a Wall or.....\n\n.....close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border......\n\n.....Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!\n\nActing Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney reiterated to reporters that Mr. Trump would be willing to shut down the border, saying \"yes\" when asked if the president meant what he said in his tweets. CBS has estimated that closing the southern border would cost up to $1 billion a day.\n\nStill, as thepartial government shutdown enters day seven, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanderstold \"CBS This Morning\"Friday thatMr. Trumpis \"willing to negotiate\" with Democrats on the $5 billion he is requesting to fund the wall.\n\nSanders blasted Democrats for the standoff that is now expected to keep roughly 800,000 federal workers from receiving paychecks into the New Year, claiming they have \"left the table altogether\" but not offering details on what the president might be willing to agree to.\n\n\"I'm not going to negotiate in the press, but the president has been willing to negotiate on this point and the Democrats have not been willing to do anything,\" Sanders said. \"It's a very sad day when we can't get Democrats to even show up for work and sit down with us and have these conversations and try to help make real solutions and get something done.\"\n\nMulvaney also said negotiations have completely shut down, and repeated Sanders' argument that Democrats were more interested in protecting Nancy Pelosi's speakership than the border. Because of this, he said, they did not expect anything substantive until she was elected speaker by Democrat majority on January 3.\n\nMr. Trump, for his part, plans to stay in Washington in the coming days. Sanders told reporters that \"there are no plans as of now\" for the president to travel to his resort at Mar-a-Lago.

In another, Sinwar is said to have described civilian deaths as “necessary sacrifices” while citing past independence-related conflicts in countries like Algeria.\n\nThe WSJ said it reviewed dozens of messages sent to ceasefire negotiators from Sinwar, who has not been seen in public since Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel left 1,200 people dead and another 250 taken hostage. The ensuing Israeli assault aimed at eliminating the group has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians in the strip, according to health authorities there.\n\nSinwar’s whereabouts are unknown but he is assumed to be hiding deep underground in Hamas’ labyrinthine tunnel system below Gaza. The messages reported by the WSJ offer a rare glimpse into the mind of the man steering Hamas’ thinking on the war and suggest an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost.\n\nIn another exchange that took place as Israel set a deadline in February to enter Rafah before the Muslim month of Ramadan, the WSJ reported that Sinwar urged Hamas’ political leaders not to make concessions and instead push for a permanent end to the war, adding that high civilian casualties would ramp up global pressure on Israel to halt the conflict.\n\n“Israel’s journey in Rafah won’t be a walk in the park,” Sinwar allegedly said in a message to the Hamas political leadership.\n\nCNN has not seen the leaked messages viewed by the WSJ and is not able to confirm the authenticity of the communications.\n\nCommenting on the WSJ report, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on X: “Sinwar profits off the deaths of Gazan civilians, calling them “necessary sacrifices” in order to urge international pressure on Israel’s efforts to eliminate his terrorist organization.”\n\nMediators are waiting for a Hamas response to anIsraeli proposal presentedby US President Joe Biden last month, which aims to release the hostages in Gaza and implement a lasting ceasefire there.\n\nSinwar’s alleged comments emerged as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on another tour through the Middle East to push all sides to agree to the latest proposal. Speaking from Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Blinken made it clear that the US believes Sinwar is the ultimate decision-maker.\n\n“I think there are there those who have influenced, but influence is one thing, actually getting a decision made is the is another thing. I don’t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza actually are the ones who can make decisions,” Blinken said, adding that “that is what we are waiting on.”\n\nBlinken said that Hamas’ answer to the proposal will reveal the group’s priorities.\n\n“We await the answer from Hamas in and that will speak volumes about what they want, what they’re looking for, who they’re looking after,” Blinken said. “Are they looking after one guy who may be for now safe … I don’t know, 10 stories underground somewhere in Gaza, while the people that he purports to represent continue to suffer in a crossfire of his own making? Or will he do what’s necessary to actually move this to a better place, to help end the suffering of people to help bring real security to Israelis and Palestinians alike.”\n\nIn early messages to ceasefire negotiators, Sinwar seemed “surprised” by the brutality of the October 7 attack on Israel.\n\n“Things went out of control,” Sinwar said in one of his messages, according to the WSJ, adding he was “referring to gangs taking civilian women and children as hostages.”\n\n“People got caught up in this, and that should not have happened,” Sinwar said, according to the WSJ.\n\nThe US-designated terrorist had also expressed discontent after not being consulted for a meeting between the Hamas political leaders with other Palestinian factions, calling the meeting “shameful and outrageous.”\n\n“As long as fighters are still standing and we have not lost the war, such contacts should be immediately terminated,” he said, adding that “we have the capabilities to continue fighting for months.”\n\nHe had also compared the war in Gaza to a 7th-century battle in Karbala, Iraq, a monumental moment in Islamic history where the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed was killed.\n\n“We have to move forward on the same path we started,” Sinwar reportedly wrote. “Or let it be a new Karbala.”\n\nOn Monday,14 of the 15 United Nations Security Councilmembers voted in favor of a US-drafted resolution around the latest ceasefire proposal, with only Russia abstaining – the first time the council has endorsed such a plan to end the war.

The Fed announced another interest rate bump Wednesday on the strength of a healthy economy.\n\nUpdated at 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced another quarter-percentage-point increase in interest rates Wednesday as expected, citing a strong labor market and economy.\n\nThe Fed raised the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, thethird hike this year.\n\nIn its announcement, the Fed said: The labor market \"has continued to strengthen and ... economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nIn the three months since the Fed last raised rates, there have been reports ofstrong jobs numbers,bullish markets, blockbustergrowth in GDP, a rock-bottomunemployment rateandsky-high consumer confidence. And on Wednesday, the Fed raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 3.1 percent from the 2.8 percent it projected in June.\n\n\"It's a particularly bright moment ... for the U.S. economy,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't dark spots.\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty over trade and how that is going to play out in the economy. But more importantly for workers, sluggish wage growth lingers and economists caution that higher rates could hurt already tight household budgets.\n\n\"Wage growth — finally it has accelerated a bit, but it's still a shadow of its former self. Especially after adjusting for inflation, which has picked up,\" says Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\nWith the unemployment rate hovering at a low 3.9 percent, workers should be in high demand. But they don't seem to be getting paid like it. Many economists touted August's 2.7 percent year-over-year wage growth as thefastest in nearly a decade. But the cost of living increased atroughly the same rate, effectively wiping out the gains for most consumers.\n\nEconomists have cited a raft of possible causes for the slow wage growth. It could be that workers are receiving morebonuses and benefitsrather than raises. Employers may bedesperate to find workers but aren't finding enough trained ones. Or it could be simply that the unemployment rate is deceiving — and that many people haveleft the labor forcesince the financial crash about a decade ago.\n\nAt a news conference earlier this year, Powell called the issue \"a bit of a puzzle.\"\n\n\"We hear about labor shortages, but where is the wage reaction?\" heasked in June, right after the Fed raised the federal funds rate for thesecond time this year— to between 1.75 percent and 2 percent.\n\nAs rates continue to climb, it could place greater pressure on families who have been relying on their credit cards and mortgages to get by.\n\n\"For a lot of households, their wages have barely kept pace with the increases in household expenses — if even that,\" says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. \"Layer on top of that rising interest rates and the rising headwind that that presents toward consumers that are trying to get their debt paid off, and it's just going to further strain families that already have tight household budgets.\"\n\nWages were not the only riddle hanging over the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's board of policymakers. There are also troubles beyond U.S. borders.\n\nFrom Argentina to Turkey, many of emerging economies have been hit by turbulence as a strengthening U.S. dollarhelped send their own currencies into a skid.\n\nAdd to that the uncertainty surrounding the deepening trade dispute between the U.S. and China, leading to tariffs leveled onhundreds of billions of dollars' worthof goods. Powell said businesses have raised concerns about the impact of trade conflicts, but the Fed has not seen much of an impact on the economy so far.\n\n\"The Fed will always say it's making policy decisions for the U.S. economy, and that's their mandate,\" Swonk says. \"But the reality is, what happens around the world does not stay around the world. It washes up on our shores, as well.\"\n\nStill, even witheight hikesin the past three years, interest rates remain historically low. The Fed effectively placed its foot on the gas during the Great Recession, driving down rates to boost borrowing and pump more money into the economy. Now that money is flowing, and now thatinflation is ticking up, most analysts say it's about time to ease up off that gas pedal.\n\n\"There's a lot of momentum in the inflation process, and I think there's always a concern that if the Fed waits too long to address inflation, then it becomes more difficult,\"..."}

The country's main opposition leaders are either in exile or in prison. With Navalny's death, dark times have just got even darker.It's likely to demoralise the Kremlin's opponents even more.\n\nWestern leaders are insisting that President Vladimir Putin be held accountable and demanding serious consequences for the Kremlin.\n\nRight now, it's hard to see what those could be. More sanctions? After its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia is already the most sanctioned country in the world, and the International Criminal Court has already issued an arrest warrant for President Putin in relation to the war.\n\nBut for Alexei Navalny's supporters, pondering the political consequences of his death is not their priority right now. They're in mourning.\n\nIrish prime minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar has described Navalny’s death as a \"further reminder that Russia is a deeply oppressive, deeply undemocratic country\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4’s PM programme, he said it served as a reminder to the West “not to take democracy, not to take human rights and our freedoms for granted\".\n\n\"These are things that have to be defended. Freedom is never free.\n\nThe most important thing we can do now is to stand by Ukraine because there is nothing that Putin wants more than to be militarily successful in his attempt to take over that country.”\n\nSarah RainsfordEastern Europe Correspondent\n\nAlexei Navalny’s family now have the confirmation they never wanted - the politician has died in prison.\n\nBut they still have no proper answers as to the cause of his sudden death, and they’re battling now to get his body released.\n\nThe politician’s relatives and team will certainly not believe any explanations that emerge from the official investigation – not in a country that tried to haveNavalny killed with a nerve agent in 2020and that denies that, despite all the evidence.\n\nWhen Navalny’s death in custody was first announced by the prison service, his family and team said they would not believe or confirm the news until they could check it for themselves.\n\nAs his wife, Yulia, put it: \"We cannot trust the Putin government. They lie constantly.\" That’s why the BBC couldn’t be 100% definitive, either. There was no independent source.\n\nAlexei Navalny's mother and lawyer Alexei Tsvetkov were seen leaving the regional department of Russia's Investigative Committee in Salekhard today\n\nA Kremlin spokesman did confirm on Friday that Vladimir Putin had been informed of Alexei Navalny’s death.\n\nOn top of that, state media were reporting his death as fact, prominent propagandists were discussing it - and whilst those sources regularly lie to bolster the Kremlin’s causes, in this case there was no obvious logic for that.\n\nThe delay, in the end, was because it took a whole day for Alexei Navalny’s mother and his lawyer to reach the prison colony above the Arctic Circle - and be handed the official notice of death.\n\nEverything linked to the process from now on is extra complicated because Navalny’s closest friends, political allies and long-term lawyers are all abroad, for safety.

Days after major newspapersreportedon a CIA assessment claiming that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the president declared his fulsome support for Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event—maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!” the president said in a statement. “We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”\n\nRead: Understanding the Jamal Khashoggi case and its consequences\n\nIn effect, even if, as reported, the CIA has “high confidence” in its conclusion about the crown prince’s culpability, Trump has bet big on Saudi Arabia and its young leader-in-waiting, and that has taken precedence.\n\nTrump has clashed with his intelligence community before, most notably over Russian interference on his behalf in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n“These are the same people,”he saidof the CIA soon after he was elected, “that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.” He then famously resisted the formal public conclusion of theCIA, the FBI, and the National Security Agencydetailing the same thing. (He hasat various times, includingunder pressure, admitted to a Russian role in election meddling, and has also at various times backtracked.)\n\nIf Trump himself is doubtful about Russian interference, though, other parts of the government have been less so. The administration has repeatedly sanctioned Russians under Trump, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted individual Russians for their role in election meddling.\n\nTrump has used strikingly similar terms to defend Russia and to cast doubt on the crown prince’s culpability in Khashoggi’s killing. Just as with Russian meddling, he has broached alternative explanations (a 400-pound guy in a basement may have been to blame in the Russia case, while “rogue actors” could have been responsible for Khashoggi’s death). He has declared the denials of the accused malefactors, whether Vladimir Putin or Mohammed bin Salman, credible. And at times hehas invokedthe unknowability of anything at all. Asked on Fox News whether the crown prince was lying about his involvement, Trumpresponded: “I don’t know, you know, who could really know?”\n\nThe White House’s Tuesday statement was striking for its implication that, whatever the truth of the crown prince’s involvement, it didn’t really matter.\n\nKhashoggi disappeared from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul while retrieving documents he needed to get married. Almost immediately, reports, sourced to leaks from Turkish intelligence, began to cast suspicion on the Saudi crown prince, who has consolidated power in the Kingdom and cracked down on dissidents. But Khashoggi, who was once close to the royal family but has criticized aspects of the current regime, was not an internal dissident. He had left for the United States in 2017, anda friendof his toldUSA Todaythat he knew he couldn’t go back. Then the kingdom came for him.\n\nThe CIA’s conclusion, which the agency hasn’t formally made public but which unnamed sources have described to news outlets includingThe New York TimesandThe Washington Post,implicates the Saudi crown prince himself.\n\nAs far as what’s public knowledge so far, the closest thing to a smoking gun comes from reports in thePostand theTimesthat one of the conspirators called an aide to the crown prince following the killing, saying ”tell your boss” that the mission was done. (That phone call, an intercept of which theTimesreportedwas shared with CIA Director Gina Haspel, does not mention MbS specifically.) Further public evidence for the link is circumstantial, and includes the structure of the Saudi system: Nothing as consequential as the interrogation or kidnapping of a high-profile, U.S.-dwelling dissident could have happened without bin Salman’s knowledge, the CIA reportedly believes.\n\nRead: The U.S. loved the Saudi crown prince. Not anymore.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily prove MbS ordered the hit himself, nor does it exclude any alternative explanations. The Saudis have sought to provide a few, though the official storyhas shiftedseveral times, from initial insistence that Khashoggi had left the consulate unharmed to a public admission he had been murdered, in what the Saudi foreign minister claimed was a “rogue operation.” The CIA has declined to comment publicly, and a Saudi spokeswomantoldthePostthat the “purported assessment” was false. For his part, Trump has also entertained a high-level Saudi role in the killing as one of many possibilities, and vowed “very sev..."}

Wade to be \"settled law\" when he was \"handpicked by the Federalist Society specifically to overturn\" that decision.\n\n\"You will go down in history as the most naive person ever to be in Congress you (expletive), (expletive), feckless, naive woman!\" the caller yelled.\n\n\"If you care at all about women's choice, vote no Kavanaugh. Don't be a dumb b---h,\" another male caller said.\n\nA letter sent to Collins' office warned that if she votes to confirm Kavanaugh \"EVERY waitress who serves you is going to spit in your food, and that's if you're lucky you (expletive).\"\n\nCollins said she considers the crowdfunding campaign raising money for whoever might challenge her in 2020 to be an attempt at bribery. More than 40,000 donors have contributed to the effort, which pledges they won't be charged if Collins votes against Kavanaugh.\n\n\"I consider this quid pro quo fundraising to be the equivalent of an attempt to bribe me to vote against Judge Kavanaugh,\"she told the conservative site Newsmax. She also told the Journal that two lawyers told her the campaign violated federal bribery law and a third said it was extortion.\n\nJordan Libowitz, a spokesman for the Citizens for Ethics and Responsibilities,told The Washington Postthat while the fundraising campaign may seem \"icky,\" it \"doesn't rise to the level of bribery because there's no agreement.\"\n\n\"It’s just the way money and politics tend to work these days,\" Libowitz told the Post.\n\nCrowdpac spokesman T.J. Adams-Falconertold Vox,\"The notion that this grassroots activism amounts to bribery is ridiculous and insulting to the more than 40,000 Mainers and other Americans who are making their voice heard through this campaign.\"\n\n\"Your swing vote could decide whether a rubber stamp for Trump’s anti-healthcare, anti-woman, anti-labor agenda gets confirmed to the Supreme Court – costing millions of Americans their healthcare, their right to choose, and their lives,\" reads a statement on the Crowdpac page, which was set up by the Maine People's Alliance, Mainers for Accountable Leadership and activist Ady Barkan.\n\n\"If you fail to stand up for the people of Maine and for Americans across the country, every dollar donated to this campaign will go to your eventual Democratic opponent in 2020,\" it reads. \"We will get you out of office.\"\n\nA tweet from Sen. Orin Hatch's office said, \"Every Democrat should be condemning these antics in Maine – attempting to bribe Senator Collins to vote against Judge Kavanaugh and threatening sexual violence against staffers if she votes for him is absolutely disgusting.\"\n\nCollins and her staff have said the aggressive tactics to sway her vote are a wasted effort.\n\n\"Bribery will not work on Senator Collins,\" Collins' spokeswoman Annie Clark told USA TODAY. \"Senator Collins will make up her mind based on the merits of the nomination. Threats or other attempts to bully her will not play a factor in her decision making whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I’m going to do what I think is right,\" Collins told the Journal. \"I am going to cast my vote – as I have done on all of the other Supreme Court nominees that I’ve been called upon to consider – based on his qualifications, his character and integrity, judicial temperament, his record, and his respect for the rule of law and fidelity to the Constitution.\"\n\nContributing:..."}

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Politics Rep Jeffries And New Generation Democratic Leadership", "output": "There is, unquestionably, a generational shift taking place in the top echelons of the Democratic Party.\n\nOut go House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 82, and her second in command, Steny Hoyer, 83 - who were more or less in charge of the caucus for almost 20 years.\n\nThirty years their junior, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries has been not so much elected as effortlessly anointed successor to Ms Pelosi, facing no competition whatsoever and receiving the unanimous support and effusive blessing of the outgoing leadership.\n\nMr Jeffries is the first black American to hold such a high-ranking position in Congress. And with the appointments of Representatives Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California in the next two leadership roles, the Democratic top table will be devoid of white men for the first time in any party's history in Congress.\n\nThat is a milestone. But before everyone gets too carried away with predictions of change, it's worth stopping and asking whether the party's approach will be any different as it faces at least two years in the minority.\n\nA swift look at Mr Jeffries' resume shows his is a thoroughly traditional political journey: first a lawyer, then a stint in New York's state house and onward to Congress.\n\nDespite him being a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), some on the left have already dubbed him just another \"corporate Democrat\". And despite his insistence that he's a \"black progressive Democrat\", he also told one interviewer: \"There will never be a moment where I bend the knee to hard-left democratic socialism.\"\n\nThat will put Mr Jeffries at odds, rhetorically at least, with the Bernie Sanders wing of the party which has grown ever more influential over the past six years, particularly among young voters.\n\nIt will also not have gone unnoticed on the left that he and two allies set up the Team Blue political action committee, designed to protect incumbent Democrats facing primary challenges from the left.\n\nHaving said that, it is curious that the CPC was not able to run a credible candidate of its own for the top job - an indication perhaps that the moderates are currently in the ascendancy, with a number of Biden legislative successes under their belts from these past two years: The American Rescue plan, infrastructure measures and even a modest gun control law. They can also claim some credit off the back of that for having seen off a widely predicted red wave in the midterm elections, with Republicans significantly underperforming the norms for opposition parties facing an incumbent president whose popularity ratings have been stuck in the very low 40s.\n\nAs for Mr Jeffries' number two, Katherine Clark, 59, she has also trod a fairly traditional path. She too is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but not one of its stalwarts.\n\nMr Jeffries can point to some issues where he is sympathetic to some aims dear to the left of the party. He's not directly opposed to Medicare for all and has backed the idea of a $15 per hour federal minimum wage.\n\nBut with Democrats now in the minority in the House, there will be little chance for them to steer any of their legislative priorities onto the statute book in any case.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Mr Jeffries promised to reach across the aisle whenever possible and to resist extremism when necessary. But the success or otherwise of the new team, which takes over on 3 January, will lie in its ability to exploit the wafer-thin majority the Republicans will have, and to ensure the promised investigations by Republicans into Joe Biden's record and into his family are robustly fought across the influential House committees.\n\nAbove all, the single digit majority Republicans will be holding in the 118th Congress is a huge and unexpected opportunity for Mr Jeffries and his team come 2024.\n\nPresidential contests of course play their part in who gets the upper hand in Congress, but with the speakership so clearly within reach in two years' time, the key pressure is undoubtedly on Mr Jeffries to get his party into a position where it can take back the House at the next time of asking.\n\nOnce signed by President Donald Trump, the spending bill will reopen the government after 43 days.\n\nIn emails released by Democrats, Epstein says Trump \"knew about the girls\". The White House says they are an attempt to \"smear\" the president.\n\nPresident Herzog's office says he holds Trump \"in the highest regard\", but that anyone seeking a pardon has to submit a formal request.\n\nThe actor remembered the primatologist as “gentle, curious, funny, and absolutely unstoppable.\"\n\nThe US president is increasingly focusing on affordability amid growing public pessimism on the economy.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

P - would be responsible for establishing a new army recruited from the ranks of the current Bundeswehr defence force and police, it is claimed.\n\nHenrich XIII, Prince of Reuss, has been identified as one of 25 people arrested and accused of plotting a far-right coup against the German government\n\nHenrich XIII is thought to have been arrested at his home in the state of Thuringia, where his family own lands, with police raiding a 'forest palace'\n\nHenrich was said to have headed a plot that called for the violent overthrow of the German state and the establishment of a new Reich with him as monarch\n\nRüdiger and his subordinates are accused of scouting three current Bundeswehr bases in Hesse, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria to see whether they could be used to station their own troops after the uprising had taken place.\n\nThey were also tasked with procuring weapons and training people how to use them - and had legally acquired several guns and put 'recruits' through target practice, it is claimed.\n\nAt least four recruitment meetings took place during the summer of 2022 to try and draw people into the ranks, according to prosecutors, who said another session happened in November.\n\nThese recruits were to assist in the uprising and then form 'homeland security companies' who would be responsible for hunting down and eliminating remnants of the 'deep state' which the group think is secretly in charge of Germany.\n\nRüdiger and his lieutenants were charged with providing them accommodation and catering, as well as setting up bugproof IT networks they could use to communicate, it is alleged.\n\nWhile ideologies within the group varied, German officials say they were broadly far-right and broadly fell under the banner of the Reichsbürger - or 'Reich Citizen' - movement.\n\nThose involved in the group believe the German state is an illegitimate fabrication, and is actually a 'company' run by foreign agents.\n\nThey often claim to be immune to modern laws based on bogus historical legal precedent, and aim to achieve emancipation from the state while re-establishing the Reich which controlled the country from 1871 to 1945.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Heinrich - a real estate entrepreneur - had contacted Russian officials with the aim of negotiating a new order once the German government was overthrown.\n\nHe was allegedly assisted in this by a Russian woman, Vitalia B.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Berlin has since denied having links to the group.\n\n'The Russian Embassy in Germany draws attention to the fact that Russian diplomatic and consular offices in Germany do not maintain contacts with representatives of terrorist groups or other illegal entities,' the embassy said.\n\nCoup plotters had already selected who would be in charge of various ministries within the new government, Bild reports. The group had outlined who would fill various departments of the 'council' - such as justice, foreign affairs and health.\n\nA man called Thomas T. has been named by authorities as Heinrich's adviser, while Judge Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, Paul G., Ruth L., René R. and Melanie R. were in-line to head the departments of the 'council', in the event of a takeover.\n\nWaidmannsheil castle in Saaldorf is one of the locations owned by Heinrich XIII which is said to have been used by far right extremists to plot a takeover of Germany's parliament\n\nGerman special police forces patrol and search the area in Bad Lobenstein, Thuringia, after anti-terror raids across the country today\n\n3,000 German officers were involved in raids on 130 locations across Germany (pictured) including a forest palace in the state of Thuringia - ancestral seat of the House of Reuss\n\nAmong those arrested were a 69-year-old former paratrooper named Ruediger v.

And we believe that should continue to be the case.”\n\nThe panel voted on party line to table the bill, meaning it is unlikely to resurface during the current legislative session.\n\nAbortion rights advocates contend that with Youngkin’s efforts to push a 15-week abortion ban, with limited exceptions, failing to advance in either legislative chamber, the governor is looking for other avenues.\n\n“The Youngkin administration’s opposition to this commonsense privacy protection measure shows his real intentions, to ban abortion and criminalise patients and medical providers,” said Tarina Keene, executive director of Repro Rising Virginia, in a statement provided to the Guardian.\n\nYoungkin has insisted that any abortion restrictions would target doctors, not women who have the procedure.\n\nThe administration has also attempted to portray a united front among Republicans for abortion restrictions, arguing it is a consensus issue. But the defection of the nine senate Republicans over the menstrual data bill follows one of their number, Siobhan Dunnavant, speaking out last month against Youngkin’s 15-week proposal.\n\nDunnavant, an ob-gyn doctor, condemned the bill as “extreme”,according to the Virginia Mercury, and said she could not support it unless it contained an exception for severe fetal abnormalities to 24 weeks. Under current Virginia law, the procedure is legal for all women until the 27th week of pregnancy.\n\nThe wrangle over menstrual data tracking has parallels with a controversy in Florida, in which high school athletics officials last weekbacked away from a “humiliating” proposalrequiring girls who wanted to play sports to answer questions about menstruation on medical forms.\n\nCritics said the requirement aligned with a push by the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, tocurtail transgender rights, an allegation denied by high school officials.\n\nThis article’s headline was amended on 16 February 2023. An earlier version did not correctly describe the purpose of the menstrual data bill or Glenn Youngkin’s position on it."}

But tonight Canadians did not give Mr Trudeau the majority mandate he wanted,\" O'Toole said. \"In fact Canadians sent him back with another minority at the cost of $600 million Canadian dollars and deeper divisions in our great country.\"\n\nTrudeau, however, wanted to form a majority government so voters could give him a strong mandate on “how to end” the pandemic.\n\nWhatever his motive, it did not work.\n\nWith some votes still being cast or uncounted, the preliminary results were a near repeat of the previous vote. The Liberal Party won 156 seats on Monday — one fewer than it acquired in 2019 — while its main rival, the Conservative Party, won 121 seats, the same as before.\n\n“If you missed the 2019 election, don’t worry, we just did a rerun for you,” said Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta.\n\nThe outcome left Mr. Trudeau in a familiar situation.

Biden canceled a scheduled trip to Chicago, CNN’s Jeremy DiamondreportedTuesday night, in order to stay in Washington and continue meetings and calls with lawmakers. The urgency is palpable, and so is the anxiety that things won’t come together in the incredibly compressed time window.\n\nYet the topline dynamics at the moment aren’t actually all that complicated.\n\nProgressives need firm commitments of some kind – a topline number, clear policy direction, something – frommoderate Democratic Sens.Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin in order to support the infrastructure bill.\n\nManchin and Sinema, though they take very different approaches and have very different concerns on policy grounds, bristle at the infrastructure bill being used as leverage and won’t provide specifics on the economic and climate package.\n\nBiden, who has worked for months on developing a solid – and trust-based – working relationship with the two, has essentially taken on the role as the closer of the most critical missing piece for any path forward: A clear view of where the two will land.\n\nDual meetings in the Oval Office yielded “some progress, got us deeper into the process,” according to one official familiar with the meetings. But there is still no clear topline number from the duo, nor a clear sense of what they would need to come on board.\n\nAnd therein lies a pretty big problem.\n\nJust to put a finer point on this: If, based on the last 24 hours, you think progressives are bluffing about sinking the bipartisan infrastructure bill, well … you’re probably living in a different universe.\n\nWith House Democratic leadership’s self-imposed September 30 deadline to put the infrastructure vote on the floor now a day away, House progressives aren’t budging. House moderates are still demanding the vote. And Pelosi’s not one to violate her own policy that she won’t go to the floor without knowing she’s going to win.\n\nRight now, progressives claim to have dozens of members ready to vote against Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and there’s been absolutely no indication this is a bluff. Progressives feel burned. They feel like they are always accepting less to get something and after nine months, they want to prove they aren’t kidding when they say they are standing firm.\n\n“How many bills have we passed in the House that the Senate has not taken up? What about on voting rights? What about the George Floyd Justice in policing? This is not about trust. This is about verify,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of the progressive caucus, said Tuesday.\n\nFor all of the frustration with Manchin and Sinema, there’s also clear and growing irritation on Capitol Hill with Biden. Not with his agenda, which has wide and deep support throughout the vast majority of both caucuses. Not with his team or their efforts. But with Biden specifically.\n\n“This is the moment for him to step up,” one House Democrat told CNN. “Meetings aren’t enough – he’s the President and we should know exactly what he wants and where we’re going.”\n\nThis ties directly into the frustration with Manchin and Sinema, and the belief among some Democrats that if Manchin told them exactly what he wanted, or demanded they come along, that’s what would happen.\n\nThat doesn’t appear to be Biden’s read on those two members – or the moment, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\n“I can assure you that when he has conversations, they’re quite candid, they’re direct,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said when CNN asked Tuesday about the approach. “And he’s had a long relationship, a good relationship with Sen. Sinema, as he has had with Sen. Manchin.”\n\nOverall though, Psaki wouldn’t delve deeper into Biden’s approach, noting, “We’re obviously in a very sensitive time right now in these discussions, a pivotal time in these discussions.”\n\nA separate White Hous..."}

(Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nMONTREAL (AP) — Negotiators reached a historic deal at a U.N. biodiversity conference early Monday that would represent the most significant effort to protect the world’s lands and oceans and provide critical financing to save biodiversity in the developing world.\n\nThe global framework comes on the day the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, or COP15, is set to end in Montreal. China, which holds the presidency at this conference, released a new draft on Sunday that gave the sometimes contentious talks much-needed momentum.\n\n“We have in our hands a package which I think can guide us as we all work together to halt and reverse biodiversity loss and put biodiversity on the path to recovery for the benefit of all people in the world,” Chinese Environment Minister Huang Runqiu told delegates before the package was adopted to rapturous applause just before dawn. “We can be truly proud.”\n\nThe most significant part of the agreement is a commitment to protect 30% of land and water considered important for biodiversity by 2030, known as 30 by 30. Currently, 17% of terrestrial and 10% of marine areas are protected.\n\nThe deal also calls for raising $200 billion by 2030 for biodiversity from a range of sources and working to phase out or reform subsidies that could provide another $500 billion for nature. As part of the financing package, the framework asks for increasing to at least $20 billion annually by 2025 the money that goes to poor countries. That number would increase to $30 billion each year by 2030.\n\n“Many of us wanted more things in the text and more ambition but we got an ambitious package,” Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said. “We have 30 by 30. Six months ago, who would have thought we could 30 by 30 in Montreal? We have an agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, to work on restoration, to reduce the use of pesticides. This is tremendous progress.”\n\nChristophe Béchu, France’s minister for ecological transition who headed its delegation, called it a “historical deal.”\n\n“It’s not a small deal. It’s a deal with very precise and quantified objectives on pesticides, on reduction of loss of species, on eliminating bad subsidies,” he said. “We double until 2025 and triple until 2030 the finance for biodiversity.”\n\nFinancing emerged late in ..."}

This action comes after the Biden administration received a plea from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) to protect schools from the \"imminent threat\" of parents sending \"threatening letters and cyberbullying\" school officials. The association considers such activities to be akin to \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\n\"As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes,\" wrote the NSBA.\n\nHas some great number of teachers, principals, and district leaders come under violent attack? Of course not. What both the Justice Department and the concerned school boards are really talking about it is theincreased numberofrecent community meetingsthat have featured angry feedback from parents. These parents are sick of COVID-19 mitigation efforts that have relegated actual students to afterthought status within the education department: the farce of virtual learning, mandatory closure when asymptomatic cases are detected, ceaseless masking. Young people who have the least to fear from the pandemic—the severe disease and death rate for the under-18 crowd isextremely low—have been forced to make tremendous educational and social sacrifices to bend the curve of COVID-19. Families are fed up with a public education system that puts the needs of students last, and they are speaking up about it.\n\nMany parents are also increasingly concerned about the curriculum in their schools. Garland's memo garnered widespread attention in conservative media circles yesterday after it wasshared on Twitter by Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who works to expose what he has termed \"critical race theory.\" AsI wrote previously, whether or not CRT is literally being taught in many K-12 schools hinges in part on a semantics argument. CRT, the obscure academic theory positing that the structures of U.S. society are racist to their core—and thus it is impossible to separate or ignore racism when confronting other issues—is not exactly sweeping U.S. kindergartens; but CRT—the tendency to reduce individuals to crude racial stereotypes that is pushed by divisive and misguided anti-whiteness gurus likeRobin DiAngeloandIbram X. Kendi—has certainly become an important component of corporate and university diversity training, and is, to some extent, trickling down to K-12 instruction.\n\nParents should be forgiven for not wanting their kids to be taught from the perspective that \"objectivism,\" \"individuality,\" and \"a sense of urgency,\"are aspects of whiteness, and thatblackstudentsstruggle to think analyticallyfor racial and cultural reasons. These are racist assumptions; they are false, and they do not belong in schools. Yet they were elements of \"Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture,\" an instructional document that has drawn plenty of citations in educational settings. To the extent that the phrasecritical race theoryis shorthand for this sort of thing, the outrage about it seems justified.\n\nBut even if it were not, parents should still enjoy the right to speak up at school board meanings and demand a say in their children's education. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, recently lashed out at anti-CRT efforts, assertingthat\"I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\"\n\nHe must have forgotten that the public school system is supposed to serve the needs of families, and not the other way around. Direct meddling in the day-to-day teaching decisions of teachers can be burdensome and counterproductive, but these parents aren't monitoring the classrooms: They're showing up to public meetings to exercise their First Amendment rights and participate in the democratic process of managing a public institution. And they often encounter furious resistance from public officials, who have turned off microphones, ended comment periods early, and occasionallymocked parents behind their backs.\n\nIt's true that some school board meetings have turned raucous, and undoubtedly there are examples of parents overreacting, or even engaging in harassment. But there's no evidence whatsoever that this represents some great danger necessitating the involvement of the FBI.\n\nStart your day withReason.

McCarthy is also trying to secure votes as part of negotiationsto keep the government fundedbeyond the September 30 deadline to avert a shutdown.\n\n“These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction and corruption,” the California Republican said in remarks outside his office on Capitol Hill. “They warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives. That’s why today I am directing our House (committees) to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.”\n\nThe House-led GOP investigations haveyet to provide any direct evidencethat the president financially benefited from Hunter Biden’s career overseas.\n\nWhite House spokesman for oversight and investigations Ian Sams called it “extreme politics at its worst.”\n\n“House Republicans have been investigating the President for 9 months, and they’ve turned up no evidence of wrongdoing…His own GOP members have said so…He vowed to hold a vote to open impeachment, now he flip flopped because he doesn’t have support… Extreme politics at its worst,” Sams said in a post to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nLaunching an impeachment investigation is also likely to divide GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill, as some Republicans – even frequent critics of Biden and his administration – have said publicly they think pursuing such a probe is a bad idea.CNN reported Monday that Republicansin the Senate are nervous that the push could backfire politically and give Biden a boost – all the while distracting from their efforts to paint the president as out of touch on the economy.\n\n“We got so many things we need to be focusing on,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican, said when asked about impeaching Biden. “I don’t see the glaring evidence that says we need to move forward, I didn’t see it in the Trump case and voted against it. I don’t see it in this case.”\n\nAndsome members of McCarthy’s conferencehave also pushed back against the impeachment effort, raising the question about whether in such a narrowly divided chamber, does the speaker have a majority to support an inquiry – a vote McCarthy does not appear willing to have at this point.\n\nBut McCarthy is facing an increasingly impatient right flank among House Republicans. His announcement came just hours before conservative Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz – who has been agitating for the effort to formally launch an impeachment inquiry – brought forward a motion to remove McCarthy as speaker if he does not comply with his list of demands.\n\nIn a floor speech, Gaetz called McCarthy’s announcement “rushed” and “a baby step.”\n\n“This is a baby step following weeks of pressure from House conservatives to do more,” Gaetz said. “We must move faster.”\n\nGaetz accused McCarthy of violating an agreement the California Republican made in order to win enough support to be elected speaker in January.\n\n“Mr. Speaker you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role,” Gaetz said. “The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate and total compliance or remove you pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair.”\n\nAccording to a GOP source, McCarthy’s announcement that he’s “directing committees” to open a formal inquiry means there will be no floor vote to formally authorize the effort – marking a reversal for the House speaker from comments he previously made. McCarthy had been weighing skipping an impeachment inquiry vote – and received criticism from Democrats for being hypocritical, since he once criticized Democrats for contemplating the same – McCarthy then gave a statement to Breitbart vowing to hold a floor vote if they go that route.\n\nBut Tuesday’s news will mark a real effort by McCarthy to start moving ahead and get House Republican skeptics on board with proceeding. A source familiar says McCarthy will not put anything on floor until they know what the numbers are. House Republican leadership will need to formally whip votes at some point which they have not yet done.\n\nPrior to making today’s announcement, McCarthy gave his leadership team and committee chairs a heads up, according to multiple sources.\n\nThe three panels expected to take lead, according to a source: the House Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio; the House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky; and the House Ways and Means Committee, led by Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri.

But this is where we are now,\" Wodnicki said, according to theWall Street Journal.\n\nShe noted that in fall 2018, engineering firm Morabito Consultants was hired to inspect the building, reports said. The engineering report pointed out flaws of the building ahead of work that would be needed for the building to meet 40-year recertification in 2021, documents showed.\n\nThe report found that thepool deck's waterproofing had failedand was not sloped to drain water. It also pointed to \"abundant cracking\" in concrete columns and beams.\n\n\"Failure to replace the waterproofing in the near future will cause the extent of the concrete deterioration to expand exponentially,\" the report stated.\n\nAbout a month after the report, former Surfside building official Rosendo \"Ross\" Prieto told the association, in a meeting, that the building was in \"very good shape.\"\n\n\"The response was very positive from everyone in the room,\" Prieto wrote in the email, which local officials provided to reporters. \"All the main concerns over their forty-year recertification process were addressed.\"\n\nBut in April, Wodnicki told Champlain South Tower residents that the initial inspection was not enough to determine the full scale of structural issues to the building.\n\nMIAMI-AREA CONDO COLLAPSE: OFFICIAL SAID BUILDING WAS IN ‘GOOD SHAPE’ DESPITE WARNING\n\n\"It is impossible to know the extent of the damage to the underlying rebar until the concrete is opened up. Oftentimes the damage is more extensive than can be determined by inspection of the surface,\" Wodnicki wrote.\n\n\"When you can visually see the concrete spalling (cracking), that means that the rebar holding it together is rusting and deteriorating beneath the surface,\" she continued. \"The concrete deterioration is accelerating. The roof situation got much worse, so extensive roof repairs had to be incorporated.\"\n\nThe firm’s 2018 report noted that some repairs were needed \"in the near future,\" according to Brett Marcy, the representative for Morabito Consultants.\n\nDonna DiMaggio Berger, an attorney for the condo association, told the WSJ Sunday that the 2018 engineer’s report didn't raise any alarms.\n\n\"Concrete spalling, rebar deterioration --these are not unusual events when you have buildings exposed to corrosive conditions,\" Berger said.\n\nThe letter's purpose was to explain the worthiness of construction projects for the building ahead of a meeting on a proposed special assessment of $15 million to be paid by residents, according to the paper.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe cause of the 12-story Miami building's collapse remains unknown.\n\nFox News' James Leggate contributed to this report\n\nThe hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a center perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Whos Blame High Us Gas Prices", "output": "A few months ago, when gas was a mere $3 or so a gallon, stickers started showing up on gas pumps that showed President Joe Biden pointing to the price. The stickers read “I did that!” and they were a sort of guerrilla warfare against the Biden administration and its policies.\n\nThe stickers may be showing up with greater frequency now as sanctions against Russia settle in, including the ban of Russian oil, which the presidentannouncedTuesday.\n\nAlthough Russian oil comprises about 3% of the crude the U.S. imports, prices are expected to climb even higher with similar bans announced inEurope. If the most dire predictions are correct, and the conflict is sustained, hold onto your wallets. Some experts see $6 a gallon coming.\n\nIf that happens, what will the stickers on gas pumps say? Well, there are already “I did that” stickers with images of Vladimir Putin on them for sale, and that’s who Biden chiefly blames. (He spoke of “Putin’s price hike” in his remarks Tuesday.)\n\nBut Republicans are right to question an energy policy that looks to countries such as Iran  and Venezuela to meet our needs, while refusing to take action to increase domestic production. They argue that Biden’s actions — from shutting down production of the Keystone XL pipeline to banning new drilling on federal land — amount to awar on fossil fuels, and that the administration bowed to progressives’ climate agenda at the expense of jobs and energy independence.\n\nTuesday’s decision came amid intensifying pressure from both sides of the political aisle. “Americans have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war,” Biden said.\n\nBut then, in an unnecessary bit of political theater, the president suggested that gas companies might share some of the blame for higher prices. The war is “no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to exploit this situation or ... American consumers,” he said.\n\nIt’s an idea that Biden has suggested before. “Gas supply companies are paying less and making a lot more,” hesaid in November. He even asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the companies engaged in “illegal conduct,” charging that they might have engaged in “anti-consumer behavior.”\n\nIn fact, some would argue that the administration’sdetermination to curb use of fossil fuelsis anti-consumer behavior. Pete Buttigieg, Biden’s transportation secretary, has taken heat for suggesting that gas prices wouldn’t be a problem if we all had electric cars, which abouthalf of all Americans don’t wantand a great many can’t afford.\n\nButtigieg also raised eyebrows when he seemed to call the Keystone XL pipeline a “permanent solution” to America’s energy needs, but said “we don’t need a permanent solution to an immediate short-term problem.” For many Americans, particularly those who live in Texas and other oil-producing states, there is a disconnect in those words that goes beyond mere semantics.\n\nYou can support clean energy and electric cars and still say, like Tesla CEO Elon Muskrecently did, “Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil and gas output immediately. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.”\n\nPete Buttigieg said the quiet part out loud, admitting the Biden administration doesn't want a \"permanent solution\" for high gas prices.A reminder that Biden cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline on Day 1 of his time in office.pic.twitter.com/fhCg5vgPcV\n\nFor Biden, rising gas prices are not a personal problem, but a political one that began dogging him last year. Last spring, for example, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy spoke of gas costing an “astounding $3.10” a gallon and said Biden was responsible. (The Associated Pressfact-checkedthe GOP claims and said that increased demand and acyberattackon the Colonial Pipeline were to blame.)\n\nBut Biden is right to worry about how pain at the pump will affect his presidency and, more broadly, the performance of Democrats in upcoming elections. The energy crisis of the 1970s dogged three presidents: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. “Watergate is what doomed Richard M. Nixon, but the energy crisis was really the nail in the coffin,” Princeton University historian Meg Jacobs toldThe Washington Post.\n\nFord and Carter tried to solve America’s energy problems in part by getting Americans to use less gas, an unappealing strategy once described by The Boston Globe as “Pay more, buy less.”\n\nCarter was, Kevin Mattson noted inSlatelast year, “the last president who called for Americans to stop consuming so much.” So at least in all the finger-pointing yet to come,  American families likely won’t be blamed ifenergy costscontinue to soar.\n\nBut keep your eye on the price of a barrel of oil, which hit an all-time high of $147.50 in July of 2008. Some analysts aresayingit could now surge as high as $185 a barrel. If that happens, don’t just hold onto your wallets, but also your bikes."}

Russian forces remain determined in their assault on Ukraine, the U.S. and Western allies continue to impose punishing sanctions and other Americans, includingWNBA star Brittney Grinerand Michigancorporate security executive Paul Whelan,still remain jailed in Russia.\n\nThe swap, the culmination of longstanding requests by both countries as well as private diplomatic wrangling, took place in Turkey when “the two planes pulled up side by side, essentially, and then they got out,” said Reed’s father, Joey.\n\n“I think it’s going to really hit home for him and for us when we finally get to see him and touch him,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nReed, a 30-year-old former Marine from Texas, was arrested in the summer of 2019 after Russian authorities said he assaulted an officer while being driven by police to a police station following a night of heavy drinking.

The governor stated he plans to remove them from office and fill the vacant seats under powers authorized by the Texas Constitution.\n\n“This truancy ends now,” Governor Abbott (R) said in a Sunday night statement. “The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3:00 PM on Monday, August 4, 2025.” The governor said he will invoke “Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382  to remove the absent Democrats from their elected office.”\n\nThe governor stated:\n\nIn that Opinion, the Attorney General considered “whether Texas law allows for a determination that a legislator has vacated office” if they intentionally break quorum. The Attorney General concluded that “whether a specific legislator abandoned his or her office such that a vacancy occurred will be a fact question for a court.”\n\nSunday afternoon, Texas House Democrats fled the state to Illinois to stop the State Legislature from moving forward on plans to redistrict Texas Congressional Districts, Breitbart News’ Elizabeth Weibelreported. Democrat Caucus Chair Gene Wu (D-Houston) said the governor is “using an intentionally racist map to steal the voices of millions of Black and Latino Texans, all to execute a corrupt political deal.” The chairman said House Democrats will “not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that (President Donald Trump) wants to steal.”\n\nThe House Democrats left the state on Sunday and reportedly flew to Illinois.\n\n“Real Texans do not run from a fight. But that’s exactly what most of the Texas House Democrats just did,” Abbott wrote in his letter on Sunday night. “Rather than doing their job and voting on urgent legislation affecting the lives of all Texans, they have fled Texas to deprive the House of the quorum necessary to meet and conduct business.”\n\nAbbott added:\n\nThese absences are not merely unintended and unavoidable interruptions in public service, like a sudden illness or a family emergency. Instead, these absences were premeditated for an illegitimate purpose— what one representative called “breaking quorum.” Another previously signaled that Democrats “would have to go by an extreme measure” of a quorum break “to stop these bills from happening.” In other words, Democrats hatched a deliberate plan not to show up for work, for the specific purpose of abdicating the duties of their office and thwarting the chamber’s business.\n\nThat amounts to an abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\n\n“The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation — not to prevent votes that may not go their way,” he wrote.\n\nThe governor called the question about whether Democrats forfeited their offices by leaving the state “a fact question for a court.”\n\nAbbott Letter About Texas House Democrats Vacating Their Offices\n\nAbbott concluded that “through a quo warranto action, a district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.”\n\n“That empowers me to swiftly fill vacancies under Article III, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution,” Abbott stated.\n\nAbbott further warned that Texas Democrats may have committed felonies in addition to forfeiting their offices.\n\n“Many absentee Democrats are soliciting funds to evade the fines they will incur under House rules,” the governor indicated. “Any Democrat who ‘solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept’ such funds to assist in the violation of legislative duties or for purposes of skipping a vote may have violated bribery laws.” He added that any person who provides such funds could also be guilty of bribery.\n\nChairman Wu made just such a solicitation Sunday night when he posted on X, “Please support our efforts. Donate to @TexasHDC!”\n\n“It seems to me that the only way some of the fleeing Democrats can avoid bribery charges is to not break quorum,” Abbottwrotein a social media post on Sunday.\n\n“I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons.” Abbott’s letter concluded.\n\nBob Priceis the Breitbart Texas-Border team’s associate editor and senior news contributor.

That’s all,” Biden said, misstating the end date he ordered, while departing the White House for a trip to promote a rail project in New York City.\n\n“The COVID emergency will end when the Supreme Court ends it,” Biden also said confusingly, givenhis own Monday planto end the emergency.\n\nBiden told “60 Minutes”in September that“the pandemic is over”and didn’t say Tuesday what specifically he wanted to accomplish by extending the emergency declaration.\n\nHouse Republicans plan to pass a bill Tuesday to end the national emergency, though the Democrat-held Senate is certain to block it.\n\nBiden’s mention of the Supreme Court could have been a reference to either his attempt to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans per person or aseparate case onthe Department of Homeland Security’s attempt to end the Title 42 border policy, which is rooted in the emergency and allows for border officials to rapidly deport migrants.\n\nThe White House said Monday evening that Biden would allow the orders to end May 11 after more than three years in effect.

Itcountsincidents “where a firearm was discharged, where any individual, other than the suspect or perpetrator, has a bullet wound resulting from the incident, that happen on K-12 school property or on a school bus, and that occur while school is in session or during a school-sponsored event.” This tracker counted 37 incidents in 2023.\n\nEverytown, an activist group that pushes for gun safety, has its own tracker, which includes “every time a firearm discharges a live round inside or into a school building or on or onto a school campus or grounds, as documented by the press.” As of Jan. 12, it counted one incident in 2024– theshooting at Perry High School in Iowa.\n\nWhen the average person reads about the number of school shootings, they’re likely imagining a scenario closer to the one counted by EducationWeek or Everytown, in which people were injured or killed by gunfire at a school. But the K-12 Violence Project tracker is cited far more often in media reports.“Nearly 350 school shooting incidents occurred across the U.S. in 2023, data shows,” according toU.S. News and World Report (Lean Left bias).\n\n“There were 346 incidents in which a gun was brandished or fired at school or a bullet hit school property in 2023, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database. That was the highest of any year in the website's data, which goes back to 1966,”reportedReuters (Center bias).\n\n“With a little less than two weeks remaining in the year, some 340 school shootings had been recorded as of Dec. 20 by the K-12 School Shooting Database,”reportedK-12 Dive (not rated by AllSides).\n\nThese reports mention the Violence Project tracker’s broad criteria, but don’t mention the other data sources.\n\nMore extreme statistics get more clicks — a phenomenon known as media bias bysensationalism. In this case, using more dire numbers could also be a sign ofnegativity bias, in which reporters emphasize bad news — which is where the common adage “if it bleeds, it leads” comes from.\n\nUnfortunately, many modern media business models are built on this. Don’t let that prevent you from seeing the full picture. Read multiple sources and compare coverage to get a broader view and decide for yourself.\n\nHenry A.

It’s still a challenge.”\n\nUS OFFICIALS ‘STRANGLING’ STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP, AUSTRALIA WARNS\n\nThat agreement offers the hope of awatershed changein Israel’s relations with the Arab world, with the added potential to enhance security coordination between two traditional U.S. allies in the Middle East. And while Blinken emphasized the difficulty of that effort — his team has tried totemper expectationsin recent weeks — Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu’sgovernment thinks it could reach a successful conclusion by early 2024.\n\n“The gaps can be bridged. It will take time. But there is progress,” Israeli Foreign Minister Eli CohentoldIsraeli Army Radio on Thursday. “I think there is certainly a likelihood that, in the first quarter of 2024, four or five months hence, we will be able to be at a point where the details are finalized.”\n\nNetanyahu, for his part, argues that a deal to normalize Israeli relations with Saudi Arabia could “effectively end the Arab-Israeli conflict,” as heput it totheWashington Examinerlast year. Yet the project is both necessitated and hampered, from the perspective of U.S. and Israeli officials, by the fear of a nuclear arms race betweenIranand Saudi Arabia.\n\n“If they get one, we have to get one,” Saudi Crown PrinceMohammed bin SalmantoldFox News in an interview that aired Wednesday evening.\n\nIran has stopped complying with the terms of the2015 Iran nuclear deal, citing then-President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the pact in 2018. Israel and the Gulf Arab states opposed the agreement as it came together at the end of Barack Obama’s presidency, on the theory that it would enable Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons eventually, but the scenario also is coming into view as “Iran has effectively removed about one third of the core group” of international nuclear inspectors, according to the top United Nations nuclear watchdog.\n\n“This measure … has been exercised by Iran in a manner that affects in a direct and severe way the ability of the IAEA to conduct effectively its inspections in Iran,”International Atomic Energy AgencyDirector-General Rafael Grossi announced this week.\n\nIsrael and Saudi Arabia both fear the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran, but the crown prince’s frank declaration likewise stoked alarm in Jerusalem. Riyadh reportedly wants to establish a uranium enrichment capacity in Saudi Arabia — a technological capability that has civil uses but would be a precondition for any successful nuclear weapons development program.\n\n“The Saudi crown prince already spoke yesterday about the possibility of Saudi Arabia having nuclear weapons,” Israeliopposition leaderYair Lapid, the center-left lawmaker whoorchestratedNetanyahu’sbrief ousterfrom the prime minister’s office, said on Thursday. “It is dangerous and irresponsible. Israel must not agree to any type of uranium enrichment in Saudi Arabia.”\n\nThe negotiations amount to a high-stakes effort to fortify the U.S. alliance network in the Middle East, as the growing cooperation between China, Russia, and Iran threatens to drive a redistribution ofpower in the region. Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw a parallelrapprochementbetween Saudi Arabia and Iran in March, followed in August by the Chinese foreign minister’s celebration of “civil nuclear energy” cooperation between Beijing and Riyadh — an arrangement that could expand or contract as Saudi Arabia considers bids from China and other countries capable of building a nuclear power plant.\n\n“Who Saudi Arabia chooses depends on what the country wants geopolitically, and there is only one person who can likely answer that question,” Center for Strategic and International Studies senior fellow Jane Nakanoobservedin early September. “A nuclear power project is a multi-decadal endeavor — including construction, fuel provision, and maintenance — that generally strengthens bilateral ties.”\n\nBiden’s administration aims to interdict the forging of those ties between China and Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials reportedly are in talks to develop a mutual defense treaty of the sort that binds the United States toJapanandSouth Korea, two cornerstones of the American alliance network in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n“The treaty is deliberately vague in order to allow different responses for different circumstances,” Hofstra University professor Julian KutoldtheNew York Times, which reported this week on the proposal. “So one can imagine a U.S. treaty with Saudi Arabia that is structured like the Japan treaty, which does not technically require U.S. action, but..."}

At this time, we have not received any reports in relation to this. If anyone believes they have been the victim of a sexual assault, no matter how long ago it happened, we would encourage them to contact police.”\n\nJust hours before the allegations were due to be made public, Brand posted a YouTube video declaring that he had received “two extremely disturbing letters” from journalists detailing “a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks”.\n\nIn his outspoken broadside, he claimed the “astonishing” and “rather baroque attacks” had left him feeling he was“being attacked” by the “mainstream media”which had a “serious and concerted agenda to silence him”.\n\nThe allegations refer to a period between 2006 and 2013, when Brand was working as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4,as well as securing leading roles in Hollywood films.\n\nOne woman claimed that she began a relationship with the comedian when she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl and he was 31.\n\nThe woman, who has not been named, said that she had a three-month relationship with Brand, who at that time was a BBC radio presenter. She claimed that he referred to her as “the child”.\n\nShe also said that he approached her in London in 2006 when she was recovering from an eating disorder and that her mother had been upset about her relationship with Brand, insisting her daughter text him her age.\n\nHowever, she told The Sunday Times that she persisted with the relationship and that he was “very charming and very attentive” but became fascinated with her virginity, before they eventually had sex.\n\nAlthough she was over the legal age of consent, she said that she felt he was “grooming” her, and alleges that he became controlling. She claimed that she had to “punch him really hard in the stomach to get him off” during one sexual encounter.\n\nThe relationship ended when she found him in bed with another woman, she said.\n\n“I think he was very skilful in the start of making his identity be, ‘I’m the womaniser. I’m a sex addict. I’m inappropriate but it’s all just a joke, it’s funny’,” she told the newspaper. “It’s a smokescreen for a lot more of his dark behaviour,” she claimed.\n\nIn his statement, Brand admitted that he had been promiscuous but said “the relationships were absolutely, always consensual”.\n\nHe added: “I was always transparent about that then, almost too transparent, and I’m being transparent about it now as well, and to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal, that I absolutely deny, makes me question: is there another agenda at play?”\n\nThe investigation also includes an account by a businesswoman, named only as Nadia, who claimed Brand raped her against a wall at his Los Angeles home during a consensual relationship in 2012.\n\nShe said she had found his “glazed-over look” unsettling, leaving her not knowing “what’s going on in his head”.\n\nShe is reported as claiming that when she declined his suggestion of joining a “friend in the bedroom” he forced himself upon her despite her repeatedly saying: “Get off”.\n\nIn a text message The Sunday Times claims it has authenticated, the woman, who was in her 30s, told him: “When a girl say[s] NO it means no.” Brand apparently replied: “I’m very sorry”.\n\nShe told Dispatches that she is “completely disgusted” by the way she claims he treated her.\n\nAnother woman, named only as Phoebe and in her 20s, said she had a brief consensual relationship with him in 2013.\n\nThe pair, who apparently met at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, had begun working on projects together. When alone at his West Hollywood home she claims that he “grabbed me and got me on the bed”, adding how she saw “something come over his eyes, I swear to God, like, black, his eyes had no more colour, they were black like the devil”.\n\nShe claimed he sexually assaulted her, before he relented but then became “super angry”.\n\nPhoebe s..."}
{"instruction": "Write a political news story from a left perspective based on the headline.", "input": "Headline: Justice Department Says Irs Must Release Trump Tax Returns Congress", "output": "The Justice Department told the Treasury Department that it “must” turn over former President Donald Trump’s tax returns to the House Ways and Means Committee, which first requested them more than two years ago.\n\nThe direction came in anopinion released Fridayby the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice to the executive branch.\n\n“The Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has invoked sufficient reasons for requesting the former President’s tax information.” Under the department’s interpretation of federal law, according to the opinion, “Treasury must furnish the information to the Committee.”\n\nThe opinion was released on the same day that the House committee and the Treasury Department are expected to submit a court filing in the lawsuit that House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal brought in July 2019seeking the tax returns. According to previous filings in the case, lawmakers and the Biden administration have been in discussion for several months as to how to move forward in the litigation.\n\n“As I have maintained for years, the Committee’s case is very strong and the law is on our side. I am glad that the Department of Justice agrees and that we can move forward,” Neal said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe OLC opinion indicated that the House committee had again submitted with the Treasury Department a request for the returns in June of this year. That request,obtained by CNN,shows that the committee had shifted the scope of its investigation since it had originally requested the returns, with a new interest in understanding the “business entanglements” of the former president and how the IRS’ presidential audit program handled them.\n\nThe House panel now say tax returns could “reveal hidden business entanglements raising tax law and other issues, including conflicts of interest, affecting proper execution of the former President’s responsibilities.”\n\n“An independent investigation might also show foreign financial influences on former President Trump that could inform relevant congressional legislation,” the new request said. It also shifted forward the years of returns the committee was seeking, to cover Trump’s time in office more squarely. The new request seeks the returns between 2015 and 2020.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump, who has intervened in the case in his personal capacity, will continue to fight the release of the returns in court. A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt Trump’s request earlier this year, the judge ordered that the Treasury Department give the former President a three-days heads up if it intends to hand over the returns, so that he could consider whether he would like to take legal action to stop the agency.\n\nThe Treasury Department declined to comment.\n\nDOJ’s shift in position is victory for the House as it continues to investigate the former President and his administration.\n\n“Access to former President Trump’s tax returns is a matter of national security,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. “The American people deserve to know the facts of his troubling conflicts of interest and undermining of our security and democracy as President.”\n\nUnder Trump, DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel cast doubt on whether the lawmakers had a legitimate legislative purpose in making the request.\n\nThe new opinion said that the previous administration got it wrong. “In evaluating whether the information sought in the April 2019 Request could serve such a purpose, however, the 2019 Opinion failed to afford the Committee the respect due to a coordinate branch of government,” the new opinion says.\n\nNeal initially requested Trump’s tax returns from Treasury and the IRS in April 2019 using a little-known section of the US tax code that allows chairmen of both Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees to request the tax returns of any American. Neal argued he made his request to learn more about the Presidential Audit program, which automatically reviews the taxes of any sitting President and Vice President.\n\nBut when the Trump administration rebuffed the request, Neal subpoenaed the records. The subpoena was ignored and in July 2019, the House filed suit.The litigation dragged on for months and then stalled out entirely in early January 2020, when the judge – Trump-appointee Trevor McFadden – put the proceedings on hold while a federal appeals court considered a separate case, concerning the House’s subpoena of former White House counsel Don McGahn for testimony.\n\nWhile that case was resolved earlier this year with an agreement for McGahn’s testimony, the legal waiting game for Trump’s tax returns continued after Biden was inaugurated, as discussions between the House and the administration about a resolution dragged out for months, according to court filings.\n\nBiden’s Justice Department has a mixed record on where it has sought to reverse Trump-era DOJ positions that protected the former President.\n\nOn the one h..."}

It’s a somewhat brazen — and welcome — move.\n\nThe U.S. is the indirectarmament supplier for deadly drug warsin Mexico and the gangsters of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The American appetite for illicit narcotics draws drugs northward; the “iron river” of weapons flows south; Mexican and Central American society is torn apart by terror and murder; desperate refugees of gang violence come north. Traffic both ways is heavy. So is the death toll.\n\nMexico vs. Smith and Wessonwas filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Defendants include Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, Ruger, Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms.\n\nPredictably, the small arms industry responded to the suit with shock, derision and denial. Gun advocates insisted that the Mexican gangsters use guns made in China or India, not here. And besides, they argue, a lawsuit is a waste of time and money, and is doomed to failure. From their reaction you’d think Mexico had demanded something truly crazy, like, say, a border wall.\n\nIn fact, a majority ofguns in Mexico can be traced to U.S. distributors— which import and resell foreign-made weapons — and to U.S. manufacturers.\n\nThe sales are rarely direct, because gun ownership in Mexico, although not uncommon, is sharply restricted. The suit alleges that sales take place in the U.S. for illicit shipment to Mexico. The key allegation is that the gun makers not only know their weapons will end up south of the border but also create them specifically for that market. One often-cited example is a Colt .38 Super pistol engraved with a picture of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. Thegun was used in 2017to murder the investigative journalistMiroslava Breach.\n\nThe Mexican Foreign Secretariat alleges that in 2019, 17,000 murders were a result of weapons illegally imported into the country from the U.S.\n\nCongress has failed to take actionto stem the flow of death southward from the U.S. It hasn’t imposed background checks, blocked straw buyers from purchasing guns for traffickers or cracked down on makers of untraceable gun assembly kits, from which buyers can assemble “ghost guns.”\n\nAny of those moves could help stem violence here at home, as well as in Mexico. For example, a ghost gun was reportedly used to seriously wound two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies in an attack last year. Without legislation from Congress, lawsuits may be the only way to go. Last week, thedeputies sued Polymer80 Inc. of Nevadafor making the gun parts.\n\nAmericans responded to COVID-19 lockdowns last year bylining up at gun stores. Manufacturers, distributors and sellers did well. Themurder rate jumped to the highest levelseen in the U.S. in more than two decades, even without the spate ofmass shootingsthat occur in a more typical year.\n\nSo Mexico just may be on to something with its lawsuit.\n\nCigarette manufacturers and merchants knew what they were doing when they sold their highly addictive and cancer-causing products in the U.S. and around the world. Liability suits, calling for them to pay the costs of the damage and death their products caused, changed the industry’s practices and Americans’ habits, and drove down the number of deaths.\n\nGun makers claim to not be subject to the same kinds of pressures due to the 2nd Amendment, which protects the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nDoes it also protect against knowingly making and selling guns to be illegally trafficked across the border?

Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making,” the official laments.He goes on to rule out the possibility of openly advocating impeachment, citing a desire to avoid a “constitutional crisis,” but mentions that unnamed cabinet secretaries considered the option early on in the administration.\n\n“Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president,” he wrote. “But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over.”\n\nThe White House called for theTimesto apologize and demanded that the “gutless” anonymous author resign in a statement issued soon after the op-ed was published.\n\n“Nearly 62 million people voted for President Donald J. trump in 2016, earning him 306 Electoral College votes — versus 232 for his opponent.

Reed and his family have denied the charges against him.\n\nIn her tweet, Paula Reed also advocated for the release of Paul Whelan, a US citizen and former Marine who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and arrested on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied.\n\nReed’s release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.\n\nHis release came after months of effort by the US government, officials said, and was particularly urgent given concerns about Reed’s health. It was ultimately secured through a prisoner swap for Russian citizen Konstantin Yaroshenko.\n\nThe exchange took place in Turkey on Wednesday, Trevor’s parents, Paula and Joey Reed, previously told CNN.\n\nRelated articleInside the months-long effort to free Trevor Reed from detention in Russia\n\nThe couple, who spoke to their son by phone shortly after the prisoner exchange, said he had been subdued. “The first phone call we got, he did not sound like himself,” Paula Reed said Wednesday evening at a news conference outside their home in Granbury, Texas.\n\nShe said his spirits seemed better by the time they received a second call from him later in the day: “He still looks terrible, but he sounded better. He sounded more like himself.”\n\nTrevor Reed, who was detained in Russia for nearly three years, saw Yaroshenko on the tarmac during the prisoner swap but did not say anything to him, according to his father.\n\n“Trevor quickly told us that they – the American plane pulled up next to the Russian plane, and they walked both prisoners across at the same time like you see in the movies,” Joey Reed said earlier on CNN’s “New Day.”\n\nThe Reeds said they had also spoken to President Joe Biden on Wednesday and expressed their gratitude.\n\n“I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence,” Biden said in a statement. “And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.”\n\nAsked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday whether he had been surprised by Reed’s release given Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Biden said: “I did it.” The President, pressed on how, continued, “I raised it,” adding, “Three months ago.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told Collins earlier Wednesday that the President waited to notify the Reed family of their son’s freedom due to “not wanting to put anyone in a position of putting that at risk – even people who are excited and joyful and looking forward to the news.”\n\nPressed on whether Russia was able to extract any other conditions from the US aside from a one-to-one prisoner swap, Psaki told CNN, “There were no other conditions that I’m aware of,” later adding, “This was about one issue and topic and I don’t think we should read into it further.”\n\nReed’s release was the result of “months and months of hard careful work across the US government” on the matter, a senior administration official said, noting that “the conversations on this particular issue have accelerated recently to get us to this point.”\n\nOne driving factor was concern for Reed’s health. His family has expressed worry about his likely exposure to tuberculosis as well as lingering effects from having Covid-19.\n\nThe official, speaking to reporters on a background call Wednesday, said that “ultimately, those negotiations led the President to have to make a very hard decision with a decision to commute the sentence of Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian smuggler convicted of conspiring to import cocaine.”\n\nYaroshenko is a Russian pilot who had been detained in Liberia by undercover US Drug Enforcement Agency agents on May 28, 2010, and brought to the US, according to Russian state news agency TASS. He was convicted of drug smuggling in 2011 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, which he had been serving at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. He has denied the charges against him.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry had previously raised the possibility that Yaroshenko could be returned “in exchange for any American national” held in Russia.\n\nThe official did not provide details about how or why Yaroshenko was chosen for the swap, but noted that he had served the majority of his US sentence and is now in Russian custody.\n\n“This is a tough call for a President.

Even after Trump's own legal adviser admitted before him the plan wasn't legal, he cranked up the pressure.\n\nThe effort culminated in a “heated” call between the two men the morning of Jan. 6 and in an insurrection later that day that put Pence, and, the panel argued, American democracy, in mortal danger.\n\nPence withstood it all.\n\nBy performing one of the few enumeratedconstitutional duties of a vice president — overseeing the counting of electoral votes in a joint session Congress — he demonstrated that the guardrails of the republic sometimes narrow to the width of one man. Pence became just that man by refusing to cave in the face of condemnation and violence, committee members said.\n\n“Donald Trump wanted Mike Pence to do something no other vice president has ever done: the former president wanted Pence to reject the votes and either declare Trump the winner or send the votes back to the states to be counted again,” panel Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said before casting Pence, his longtime political adversary, in the role of democracy’s champion.\n\n“Mike Pence said no,” Thompson continued. “He resisted the pressure. He knew it was illegal. He knew it was wrong.”\n\nThough Trump is the focal point of the committee’s investigation, Pence emerged as the central figure in Thursday’s hearing. The Democratic-dominated panel lauded him in absentia, turning the conservative stalwart — who is widely expected to run for president in 2024 — into an unlikely hero for their partisans.\n\nThough outlines of Pence’s story were already known, it is a central component of the committee’s goals to prove that Trump pursued illegal and anti-democratic means to remain in power. Moreover, the panel contends that Trump knew — or at least had been advised — that he lost the election, that he could not overturn the results through legal means, and that Pence had no constitutional authority to interfere with the electoral count.\n\nNone of that stopped Trump from trying to hold power, or ultimately from targeting Pence as a turncoat.\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, as Trump looked for ways to reverse the outcome, lawyer John Eastman began promoting a plan to have Pence refuse to certify electors. Trump became enamored of the idea, even though White House lawyers — and Eastman himself — advised Trump that it was bunk, according to witnesses who testified before the Jan. 6 panel.\n\nPence counsel Greg Jacob and former Circuit Court Judge J. Michael Luttig appeared before the committee Thursday, joining a handful of witnesses whose testimony was recorded on previous dates.\n\nJacob said that Eastman told Trump the plan was not legal on Jan. 4. Days later, Eastman still advocated Pence execute on it, Jacob said.\n\nIn another clip, Eric Herschmann, a Trump White House lawyer, said he had discussed with Eastman the potential dangers of the plan.\n\n“I said, ‘You’re going to cause riots in the streets,’” Herschmann recalled. “And he said words to the effect of, ‘There’s been violence in the history of our country, Eric, in order to protect the democracy or protect the republic.’”\n\nIndeed, violence was discussed, anticipated and threatened by both proponents and opponents of Eastman’s plan for Pence to steal the election, according to witness testimony.\n\nAs Pence prepared a public statement explaining why he would certify the electoral votes, Jacob testified, the vice president focused on what he viewed as his duty to the Constitution and the American public.\n\n“The vice president said, ‘This may be the most important thing I ever say,’” Jacob said in recorded testimony.\n\nDuring Thursday's hearing, Jacob testified that it was Pence’s “first instinct” to reject the idea that one man — the vice president — could overturn the will of voters when he was first apprised of the concept in early December 2020.\n\nIn the final days and hours before the electoral vote count, when Trump had exhausted alternative remedies, the president ramped up pressure on Pence. That included berating Pence during a phone call on the morning of Jan. 6.\n\nFurious that his vice president still intended to defy him, Trump called Pence “the ‘p’ word,” according to recorded testimony from Julie Radford, a former chief of staff to Ivanka Trump.\n\nThe younger Trump was one of several family members and top aides who we..."}

Susan Collins being bribed to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh? That’s what she and others are saying.\n\nThe conservative-leaning news site Newsmaxreportedon Monday that a prominent Republican elections lawyer is calling for an investigation into what it described as a more than $1 million “threat” hanging over Collins’s head, depending on her vote on Kavanaugh. In a statement to Newsmax, Collins said she believed there was an attempt to “bribe” her vote and said she wouldn’t be the target of “quid pro quo fundraising.”\n\nBut no one is actually trying to give Collins money to vote against Kavanaugh.\n\nInstead, what Newsmax and Collins are referring to is acrowdfunding campaignrun on the progressive political crowdfunding platform Crowdpac. Launched by ALS patient and activist Ady Barkan, the grassroots community action organization Maine People’s Alliance, and the activist and watchdog group Mainers for Accountable Leadership, the campaign is meant to encourage Collins to vote against Kavanaugh.\n\nIt’s raised $1.1 million so far, but that money will never go to Collins. The proposition: If Collins votes against Kavanaugh, donors who have pledged to the campaign won’t be charged. If she votes for him, the funds raised will go to her Democratic opponent when she is up for reelection in 2020.\n\nCollins and Alaska’s Sen. Lisa Murkowski are considered to be the two key votes on Kavanaugh who will determine whether he is confirmed as a justice of the US Supreme Court. Both women are in favor of abortion rights, and progressiveshave been pushing them fiercelyto oppose Kavanaugh’s nomination because of concerns over his stance onRoe v. Wadeand the possibility that he might vote to overturn or chip away at the landmark case.\n\nKavanaugh and Collinsmet in August, and she said he told her that the matter was “settled law,” even though, as Vox’s Anna North pointed out,during his confirmation hearing last week, Kavanaugh largely danced around giving a straight answer on the issue.\n\nAt issue here is whether Collins is being, essentially, paid for her vote. As mentioned, the crowdfunding campaign isn’t promising a donation to her campaign, but if she votes no, it would give money to her eventual opponent.\n\nT.J. Adams-Falconer, a spokesperson for Crowdpac, told Newsmax that the platform had been “thoroughly vetted” by the Federal Election Commission and had received “unanimous approval” from it. He said Barkan, the progressive activist who created the campaign, and his Be a Hero PAC have selected a nominee fund for the pledges if they become contributions that will go toward Collins’s eventual opponent, which, he said, is legal.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Vox, Adams-Falconer said the response to the campaign has been “incredible” and an example of tens of thousands of people expressing their political speech and “counteracting the dark money that has poured in from big, corporate groups” for years. “The notion that this grassroots activism amounts to bribery is ridiculous and insulting to the more than 40,000 Mainers and other Americans who are making their voice heard through this campaign — no matter which way she votes, Senator Collins will not receive anything of value from this campaign,” he said.\n\nDespite Crowdpac’s defense,the Wall Street Journal’s editorial boardjumped onto the bribery bandwagon on Tuesday, saying the campaign is clear “quid pro quo” and questioning its legality. “We’re all for citizens exercising their free-speech rights, including campaign donations, for or against political candidates,” the board wrote. “But federal law defines the crime of bribery as ‘corruptly’ offering ‘anything of value to a public official, including a Member of Congress, with the intent to ‘influence any official act.’”\n\nCollins told the Journal that three attorneys had told her it’s a “clear violation” of federal law. In the same interview, she also complained about “out-of-state voicemails” being left on answering machine in her offices. Activists have also mailed herwire hangers, referencing a dangerous abortion method women sometimes resort to when the medical procedure is illegal.\n\nSome progressives have pointed out that while many on the right are complaining about the grassroots crowdfunding campaign around Collins as bribery, they seem to have no such qualms about campaign donations from major corporations or billionaires such as the Koch brothers, which are completely legal under campaign finance laws.\n\nCollins told Newsmax that the crowdfunding campaign out of Main..."}

It applies to mass transportation including planes, trains, buses and hubs like airports.\n\nThe official’s comments came after CNN reported that federal officials began notifying stakeholders in the airline industry of the upcoming announcement. Three sources, including two industry officials and a government official, described the conversations to CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe requirement, which now extends to April 18, was previously set to expire a week from Friday, and the policy will be reviewed over the next month, the official said.\n\n“During that time, CDC will work with government agencies to help inform a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor,” the official said. “This revised framework will be based on the Covid-19 community levels, risk of new variants, national data, and the latest science. We will communicate any updates publicly if and/or when they change.”\n\nOne source told CNN that means the CDC may ultimately allow the mandate to lift before the 30-day period is up if transmission rates of the virus nationwide drop to low enough levels.\n\nThe federal announcement comes as many state and local mask mandates have been dropped or are set to be rescinded.\n\nIn the skies, requiring masks has proven to be a divisive issue.

Haley took a different approach: blaming the conflict on the role the government was going to play.\n\nTWELVE DAYS OF WEX-MAS: HOW SERIOUS IS BIDEN ABOUT FIXING THE BORDER IN 2024?\n\n“I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run,” she said. “The freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.”\n\nHaley then pressed the voter to explain what he thought the cause of the Civil War was, prompting him to shoot back that he was “not running for president.” Haley maintained her stance that the conflict was caused primarily by the role of government, resulting in a tense exchange between the pair.\n\n“Government doesn’t need to tell you how to live your life. They don’t need to tell you what you can and can’t do. They don’t need to be a part of your life,”Haley said. “They need to make sure that you have freedom. We need to have capitalism. We need to have economic freedom. We need to make sure that we do all things so that individuals have the liberties so that they can have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do or be anything they want to be without government getting in the way.”\n\n“Thank you,” he replied. “In the year 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you’d answer that question without mentioning the word ‘slavery.’”\n\n“What do you want me to say about slavery?” Haley responded before calling for the next question.\n\nThe exchange came during an event in the first-in-the-nation primary state less than four weeks before Republican voters cast their ballots to choose their party’s presidential nominee. Haley has experienced a climb in New Hampshire in recent weeks, rising in the national polls to overcome Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) as she works to close the gap between herself and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHaley clarified her comments during an interview on New Hampshire radio on Thursday morning, claiming the man asking the questions was a “Democrat plant” trying to push her into a corner. Haley acknowledged the war was caused by slavery, arguing she was focusing her answer on “what does it mean to us today?”\n\n“Of course, the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That’s the easy part of it,” she said. “But more than that, what’s the lesson in all this? That freedom matters. And individual rights and liberties matter for all people. That’s the blessing of America. That was a stain on America when we had slavery. But what we want is never to relive it. Never let anyone take those freedoms away again.”\n\nHowever, Haley’s comments on the Civil War could come back to haunt her as several of her opponents, including President Joe Biden, have already used the incident to attack her.\n\n“It was about slavery,” Bidensaid in a brief response on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nDeSantis’s campaign also seized on the comments, calling the incident “disastrous.”\n\n“Yikes,” the teamwrote on X.\n\nIt’s not the first time Haley has come under fire for making comments related to the Civil War. She received pushback while running for governor in South Carolina when she defended states’ rights to secede from the U.S., describing the conflict as two sides fighting between “tradition” and “change.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDuring that same interview in 2010, Haley also dismissed the push to remove the Confederate flag from statehouse grounds, arguing the flag “was not something that is racist.” Haley later ordered the removal of the flag in 2015 after a mass shooting that left eight black attendees dead at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nThere were several problems that led to the outbreak of the Civil War, with many pointing to the Southern states’ desire to preserve slavery as a predominant cause. Haley’s home state of South Carolina mentions slavery in its Ordinance of Secession, explaining its reasoning for removing itself from the Union.\n\nNotifications"}

If I had an accident or got lost, I was on my own. Heck, I couldn't even text my dad that I was coming home. My smartphone dependency reared its head and I felt bereft and isolated without a lifeline to the world in my pocket.\n\nRead more:Best Phone to Buy for 2024\n\nAT&T customers nationwide felt the exact same thing in early June when they suddenlycouldn't call anyone using other carriers. The loss of connection was a repeat of an incident in February whenan AT&T service outage abruptly cut them offfrom mobile networks for several hours before it was restored.\n\nWhile its network was down, AT&T told affected customers to lean on Wi-Fi for their smartphone needs, which can keep folks connected in a pinch if they stay in one place and don't need to use cell network-only services like SMS. But for everyone else who had to drive to work or otherwise leave their house or office, the outage was a reminder of how much our daily lives are routed through smartphones.\n\nIt's such an obvious reality that it requires little explanation -- anyone hitting a dead zone on a long drive discovers they can't alter their GPS route through their maps app or stream a new song. Same thing when you don't charge your phone and it dies late at night. An annoyance, but usually a temporary one. When outages last an unforeseeable length of time, it shows how much our daily flow depends on an endless stream of information and connection.\n\nLet's take work as an example. For better or worse, having email and occupational messaging apps like Slack on our phones has slid modern workers into the expectation of being reachable at all times. If you can't respond to outreach, you could suffer consequences -- even when the lack of access isn't your fault. Losing access to news and activity feeds can stop people in some industries -- like, admittedly, journalism -- from working entirely.\n\nFor families, constant communication is crucial to make sure kids get picked up and driven to sports practice and tutoring, dinners get coordinated and schedules are followed. When the constant flow of updates dry up, tempers flare and parents may fear the worst.\n\nAnd losing service while on the go means you can't even triage your problem. Is service down for everybody or just you? Does the problem lie with your device, its software or the network?\n\nAll of which is to say that smartphones have trained us to expect a constant flow of information that we unconsciously use to course-correct by the minute. All that hustle and productivity culture leads us to squeeze in one more email or task if we hear that our next meeting got delayed; if a friend cancels evening plans, we can immediately reach out to someone else or pivot to a night tackling necessary chores.\n\nCut off the flood of updates and info, and we're left scrambling to do what people did before smartphones: make inferences and take action with incomplete information. Which can be unsettling, if not downright harrowing for those who take comfort in GPS and news updates.\n\nApple's Emergency SOS feature connects iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 owners in remote areas to emergency services using satellites.\n\nThis is a feature, not a bug, of our modern constantly online lives -- which, we have to admit, has been remarkably outage-free compared with the network blips that used to regularly knock out phone service in prior decades. While there's something to be said forweaning yourself off doomscrollingor overindulging in TikTok or Instagram, just havingaccessto anything you may want to look up or order online or navigate to has led us to treat online service as an umbilical feed from the outside world.\n\nIf nothing else, the AT&T outage and the smartphone dependency it exposes should be a reminder that backup communication methods are still around. Something as simple as swinging by the library or a friendly coffee shop to use its Wi-Fi to access email or non-SMS messaging platforms can let you get the word out to bosses and family that your network is down. Ask a business to use its landline and make calls, even to friends or colleagues (who hopefully aren't also affected by an outage) to look online and see what's up with your carrier or if service is just down in your area.\n\nWe're all guilty of plugging an address into GPS and letting it guide us turn by turn to our destinations, so it will probably take a minute to relearn what we did before Google Maps on our phones.

All rights reserved. Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided byFactset. Powered and implemented byFactSet Digital Solutions.Legal Statement. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.\n\nFox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram provides insight into a bipartisan immigration reform agreement between Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. on 'Special Report with Bret Baier.'\n\nSens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., are reviving talks on apotential immigration agreementthat would see a pathway to citizenship combined with border security measures -- an effort to see if there is appetite for a reform bill before Republicans take the House early next year.\n\nSources familiar with negotiations told Fox News that the two lawmakers have a draft framework for discussion that would see a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants protected (or eligible for protection) from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program combined with border security funding. A Senate aide stressed that the discussions are in a very early stage and that the senators are circulating the framework to see if there is interest and a potential agreement. Another said that it was incorrect at this stage to describe the draft as a \"deal.\"\n\nThe border security measures would include keeping Title 42 -- a Trump-era public health order that has been used to expel a majority of migrants at the border, but that is due to be wound down later this month -- in place for at least one year, with a metric component in place for extensions.\n\nDEMOCRATS FIRE UP PUSH FOR DACA AMNESTY IN LAME DUCK SESSION BEFORE GOP TAKES HOUSE\n\nOther border security elements would include hiring more Border Patrol agents as well as pay increases, and the creation of regional processing centers to surge resources at the border and judge asylum claims -- a provision included in last year’s Bipartisan Border Solutions Act. It would also include resources for detention, deportation and expedited removal of illegal immigrants.\n\nA source said that the funding for such measures would be at least $25 billion and could be upwards of $40 billion, which would be significantly higher than border security funding in previous versions of DACA-for-border security proposals.\n\nThat would be combined with a pathway to citizenship for what is estimated to be two million illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors and are eligible for protection under the2012 DACA program.\n\nThe push for such a move has been given a sense of urgency after a federal appeals court kept in place a bar on further DACA enrollments after finding the program to be illegal.\n\n\"We have a population that is not reproducing on its own with the same level that it used to,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumersaid last month. \"The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers and all of them, because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here. And we will be pursuing that in the next Senate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the looming end to Title 42 on Dec. 21, and fears that it could lead to yet another surge in illegal migration at the border, has also fueled talks about finding an agreement.\n\nHowever, some Democrats have balked at increases in enforcement, detention and removal, while many Republicans have ruled out any form of \"amnesty\" as long as there is an ongoing crisis at the southern border.\n\nFox is told that there are questions about whether it would be possible to pass the bill in the next three weeks, and that there are multiple Republicans who oppose it. Meanwhile, time is running out for any bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants with Republicans set to take the House early next year.\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy has called any form of amnesty a \"non-starter\" in the next Congress.\n\n\"No amnesty,\" he told Fox News in October.\n\nMeanwhile, immigration hawks have beenlobbying hardagainst any possible deal in the lame-duck session. Recently, a number of groups and former officials sent letters to Congressional urging them to unite against any such deal in the lame-duck.\n\nOne of those groups, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) took aim at the discussions this week, saying it had been hopeful that with the ongoing border crisis, Democrats were going to \"wise up\" and move to secure the border.\n\n\"Well, why would they do that when a Republican is ready and willing to ignore his constituents and amnesty millions in exchange for reforms that are nothing more than window dressing,\" RJ Hauman, head of government relations and communications, said in a statement. \"It wouldn’t matter if he got $250 billio..."}

Joe Manchin blocking a new spending bill.\n\nBiden, speaking in front of a former coal power plant that’s being converted to support offshore windmills, said he will unilaterally act as concern aboutsoaring inflationhas lead to in gridlock in Congress.\n\n“This crisis impacts every aspect of everyday life,” Biden said in a 19-minute speech. “That’s why today I’m making the largest investment ever, $2.3 billion, to help communities across the country build infrastructure that’s designed to withstand the full range of disasters we’ve been seeing up to today — extreme heat, drought, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes.”\n\nThe funds will be taken from the FEMA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program for fiscal year 2022, according to the White House.\n\n“Right now there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home,” Biden said amid a heat wave impacting parts of Europe and North America.\n\n“My team is also working with the states to deploy $385 million right now — for the first time, states will be able to use federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes where people can get through these extreme heat crises,” he said.\n\nBiden made the trip aboard greenhouse-gas-spewing Air Force One as his special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, faced charges of hypocrisy after a report said his family’s private jet has emittedmore than 300 metric tons of carbon dioxidesince he assumed the post last year.\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey joined Biden aboard Air Force One. Markey co-authored theGreen New Dealwith Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nBiden’s transportation for a short speech included the flight to Warwick, Rhode Island, followed by a gas-guzzling motorcade 25 miles to Brayton Point Power Station in Somerset, Mass., before a return trip to DC.\n\nA decoy presidential plane typically makes the trip as well, compounding the carbon dioxide put into the air. In addition,two C-17 military planesthat transport Secret Service vehicles flew to Rhode Island a day ahead of the president to ensure proper security precautions were in place.\n\nThe visit comes as the administration weighs declaring a national climate emergency in a bid to bypass Congress to redirect funds.\n\nBiden didn’t commit to making such a declaration during his Wednesday remarks, but vowed, “I’ll use my executive powers to combat the climate crisis in the absence of congressional actions.”\n\nThe president made the anti-global warming address after returning Saturday from a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia, wherehe sought greater oil exportsto offset high gas prices that are dragging his approval ratingas low as 30%.\n\nThe White House is openly weighing an emergency declaration after Manchin (D-WV) said Friday he will block Biden’s request to pass a pared-down version of the Build Back Better Act, which included $555 billion in environmental spending.\n\nManchin, a former coal industry leader, said he blocked new spending because he’s concerned about inflation hitting a fresh 41-year high of 9.1% in June after massive spending during the COVID-19 pandemic, including Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, which passed last year without Republican support.\n\n“It’s not prudent,” said Manchin, effectively killing the plan, which could pass the evenly divided Senate with a bare majority under special budget reconciliation rules.\n\nThe stalled Build Back Better Act proposed $12,500 rebates for the purchase of electric vehicles, among other initiatives. White House counselor Steve Ricchetti’s brother, Jeff Ricchetti, was paid$280,000 since last yearto lobby for General Motors, which produceselectric vehiclesthat have been promoted by Biden.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and House Republicanson Tuesday clashed over whether it was appropriate to encourage Americans to seek out potentially more expensive electric vehicles amid high gas prices.\n\nAccording to the Kelly Blue Book, the average price of a new electric vehicle as of June was $66,997 — 13.7% more than last year — compared to $26,211 for a new compact car. Electric cars can bebought new for as little as$28,000depending on the model.\n\nIt’s unclear what Biden would seek to accomplish by declaring an emergency. Former President Donald Trump declared an emergency in 2019 to redirect about $8 billion toward building a US-Mexico border wall after also meeting congressional gridlock on his proposal.\n\nEnergy & Environment Newspointed toan analysisby University of California at Berkeley law professor Dan Farber that said an emergency would allow a president to suspend oil drilling leases or direct the military to move toward more environmentally friendly projects and use of electric vehicles.\n\nFarber said it mig..."}
