Pittman of the Northern District of Texaswrotethat \"the HEROES Act—a law to provide loan assistance to military personnel defending our nation—does not provide the executive branch clear congressional authorization to create a $400 billion student loan forgiveness program. The Program is thus an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s legislative power and must be vacated.\" He continued by saying that the plan is \"either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises of legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the United States.\" In response, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said \"We will never stop fighting for hardworking Americans most in need—no matter how many roadblocks our opponents and special interests try to put in our way.\"For Context:The program was alreadypauseddue to a separate legal challenge. In August, Bidenannounced a planfor borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year to have at least $10,000 of their federal student loan debt cancelled.

W. Cooke (Right bias)argued that there is “no chance that the Democrats will be able to get around Joe Biden’s obvious decline.” Outlining why the Democrat’s current strategy won’t work moving forward, Cooke concluded, “President Biden cannot fake being competent because the people who are ultimately empowered to judge his competence have no great obligation to pretend that they cannot see the truth.” A writer in theWashington Examiner (Lean Right bias)echoed concerns, writing, “None of us gets out of here alive, and 81-year-old Biden is not going to level out onto a plateau of acceptable lucidity.

Exxon’s record setting year is being widely attributed to two factors— geopolitical turmoil stemming from Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the continued recovery from the pandemic.Key Quotes:Exxon CEO Darren Woods stated that “while our results clearly benefited from a favorable market, the counter-cyclical investments we made before and during the pandemic provided the energy and products people needed as economies began recovering and supplies became tight.” A statement from White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan criticized oil companies, stating that “oil companies have everything they need, including record profits and thousands of unused but approved permits, to increase production, but they’re instead choosing to plow those profits into padding the pockets of executives and shareholders.”How The Media Covered It:Left- and Center-rated outlets were more likely to highlight the past year’s high fuel prices when noting the profits, and emphasized the connection between the Ukraine war and Exxon’s profits. Right-rated outlets covered the story less, despite covering gas prices extensively prior to the 2022 midterm elections, and were more likely to focus on the White House’s criticism of the profits and Exxon’s response.\n\n### Response:", "stance_target": "center", "stance_pred": "center", "stance_conf": 0.5203467607498169, "topic_similarity": 0.6860968470573425, "reference_similarity": 0.7108118534088135, "generation_length": 261}

The move by Sinema, who has frequently bucked and scaled back Democratic policy proposals, is not predicted to drastically upset the balance of power in the Senate but is being framed by some as an indication of increasing frustration and dissolution with the two-party system, and by others as a political plot by Sinema to retain her position against an expected Democratic primary challenge in her next election.From the Left:Greg Sargent called Sinema’s decision “an epic gamble born of necessity,” determining it to be “her only chance at keeping her Arizona Senate seat beyond 2024.” A writer inNewsweek (Center Bias)saidSinema’s move“exposes how little she cares for the party she called home for her career—and for that party's voters,” determining that she is “fully aware of the kamikaze mission she's on” and how it will hinder both the Democratic Party and her own political ambitions moving forward.From the Right:Many on the right praised Sinema’s move and predicted how the decision would impact the larger political stage. Quin Hillyer tied Sinema’s announcement to a broader movement of voters away from political affiliations, stating that “the public hunger remains for candidates less interested in toeing party lines” and predicting the move increasing the odds of a third-party President in the near future.Brad Polumbo (Lean Right Bias)praised Sinema anddeclared that“the people share Sinema's frustrations with both establishment parties.”\n\n### Response:", "stance_target": "right", "stance_pred": "center", "stance_conf": 0.8007838726043701, "topic_similarity": 0.8707195520401001, "reference_similarity": 0.7202457189559937, "generation_length": 333}
